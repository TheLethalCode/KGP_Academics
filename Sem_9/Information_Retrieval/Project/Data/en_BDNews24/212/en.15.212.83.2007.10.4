<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis was a proud man on Thursday after becoming only the fourth South African to score two centuries in the same test. "It is a big moment for me to look back at," Kallis told reporters after adding an unbeaten 100 to his first-innings 155 in the first test against Pakistan. "It is something which at the end of my career I will always look back at with pride." Kallis led his team to 264 for seven in their second innings, helping South Africa set Pakistan a victory target of 424. The home side were 146 for three at the close of play on day four. It was a spectacular return for Kallis after he was dropped for the recent Twenty20 World Cup. "It would have been nice to play in the Twenty20 but on the other hand it has also allowed me to come to this series well rested," said the 31-year-old. "I am not one to worry too much about what happens off the field. As long as I am giving my all for my country I am thankful for it and happy at what I have done. "You try your best every time you walk out to play." Kallis, South Africa's highest test run-getter, said his first innings was better than his second. "They were two totally different knocks," he said. "One was a grinding innings just to make sure we got enough runs on the board to have enough fielders around the bat. "The first one was better as I struck the ball better.
