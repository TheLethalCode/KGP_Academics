 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  The call money interest rate went up to as high as 8 percent in the inter-bank money market Tuesday amid withdrawal pressure ahead of Eid, fund managers said. "It's normal. The call rate has increased for the time being due to withdrawal pressure for Eid," a fund manger at a private bank said, asking not to be named. Inter-bank deals took place between 7.0 and 8.0 percent rates with the weighted average rate at 7.50 percent, the official said. But the call rate for leasing and financial institutions climbed over 8.5 percent. "I hope things will ease after Eid," he said, adding that call money rates usually rose ahead of Eid festivals. On Monday, the call money rate hovered in the region of 6.50-6.60 percent. A senior official with Jamuna Bank, who preferred not to be named, put the rise in call rate down to banks' increased participation in Bangladesh Bank's reverse repo, a regular instrument used to drain surplus funds from the market in line with monetary policy. The weighted average call money rate, which was 7.0 percent in July this fiscal, declined slightly before picking up at 6.96 percent in Sept. "A major portion of funds remains stuck with reverse repo. It has created a shortage even though banks now have surplus funds," the official said. According to Bangladesh Bank, excess liquidity of the banks rose to Tk.14284.33 crore in July from Tk 14279.61 crore in end-June this year. On Oct 7, BB mopped up Tk 1634 crore through reverse repo of various tenures. Of the amount, BB withdrew Tk 1430 crore against one-day tenure bids. bdn
