 HAVANA, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Revolutionary icon Ernesto "Che" Guevara, whose image is one of the most reproduced in history, was camera-shy and disliked being hounded by Cuba's paparazzi. Two Cubans who photographed Guevara extensively after Cuba's 1959 revolution, Liborio Noval and Roberto Salas, said they had to catch the Argentine-born doctor turned guerrilla fighter by surprise to get a shot of him. "OK, that's enough, don't take any more pictures of me, I am not the key figure," Guevara once barked at Noval, the photographer said at a photo exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the death of Fidel Castro's right-hand man. Guevara was industry minister and central bank governor in the early years of Castro's leftist government before he set off on unsuccessful quests to spread revolution in the Congo and Bolivia, where he was captured and executed in 1967. Che, as Cubans nicknamed Guevara, made photographers sweat for a picture. Noval, who snapped Guevara hauling sacks of sugar and pushing wheel-barrows bare-chested, said he showed up at a building site one day. Guevara ordered him to cart cement for several hours before he could take any pictures. Salas, who captured the profile of a cigar-smoking Guevara in one famous shot, said he never allowed photographers to join him on trips to the Soviet Union and China. One time Guevara did pose for photographers with Castro was when the two played golf together in 1960 to thumb their noses at Washington. Ailing Castro, 81, who has not appeared in public for 14 months, wrote that the bourgeois game of golf was a photo opportunity to make fun of US President Dwight Eisenhower after he suspended Cuba's sugar import quota. The most iconic image of Guevara gazing into the distance with his long locks of hair flowing from under a soldier's black beret was unposed. Cuban photographer Alberto Korda snapped it in 1960 as Cuban leaders attended a funeral service for victims killed when a freighter loaded with weapons blew up in Havana harbor. His newspaper did not run the photo, going with one of Castro. Korda hung up the a cropped picture of Guevara in his studio where it gathered dust until Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli walked in the door in 1967. Korda gave him two prints at no charge. After Guevara died in Bolivia, Feltrinelli printed millions of posters with Korda's picture, helping build Guevara into an international folk hero of mythical proportions
