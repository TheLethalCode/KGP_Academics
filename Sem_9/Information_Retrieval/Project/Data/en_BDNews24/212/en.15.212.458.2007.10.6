<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) -- A group of protectionist activists Saturday said any government agreement with Asia Energy would tantamount to an utter betrayal with people, making its anti-corruption stance farcical. The member secretary of the National Committee for the Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Port, Prof Anu Muhammad, made the remarks at a press conference on "Ill-motives of Asia Energy and the ADB Mission in Bangladesh" at Dhaka Reporters Unity. The convenor of the organisation, Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah, said: "The ADB and two companies have expressed concern at the government indecision on the investment proposals of TATA and Asia Energy." "They are portraying the indecision in a different way and sending a wrong message to foreign investors," he said. "We want to say clearly that the people of Bangladesh do not want these investments," he said. In his keynote speech at the press conference, Prof Anu Muhammad said: "People rejected the deal by shedding blood at the Asia Energy's Fulbari Coal Project site when its anti-people, anti-environment and anti-national interest character was revealed." "Our question is how advisers look at the scope to talk again with the company about such a project. The ADB board has not yet approved the Asia Energy project, but ADB officials are pursuing implementation of the project before its approval assuming the role of corporate lobbyists." The ADB country director has also put pressure in favour of the project and pursued it." "Like the World Bank and the IMF, the ADB can also, in no way, be termed a development partner. The ADB has financed different projects in Bangladesh by providing loan," he said. "It is now time to determine responsibility for the destruction and waste in the forest, water, education, energy and power sectors of the country wrought by its projects and how much national capability has been reduced." "Poverty has taken a permanent shape due to such projects." Noting the water stagnation in the Bhobodaha area of Jessore, he said, "Bhobodaha is a glaring example of the utility of the ADB's flood control embankment project." Prof Anu Muhammad said, "Although the Bangladesh government has not signed any mining licence agreement with Asia Energy, the company is drawing money from the London Stock Market showing Bangladesh coal. We have not yet seen any government role against such corrupt activities." He said that the journalists, who had visited Germany, courtesy of Asia Energy, were in effect conducting publicity in favour of the company. "The company has recently been conducting propaganda by advertising in different newspapers. We request the owners of the newspapers not to sell their conscience to plundering companies like Asia Energy in exchange of money," he added. Dr Shamsul Alam said, "The main task of this government is to hold election. The government does not have the jurisdiction to take any decision on any matter linked with people's rights." Justice Golam Rabbani, speaking at the press conference, said: "As per the constitution, this government will conduct day-to-day work, but if it adopts a policy making role and does not abide by the people's agreement, it will be very sad." bdnews
