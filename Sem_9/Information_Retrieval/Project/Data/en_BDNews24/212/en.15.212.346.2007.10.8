<TITLE> North Korea oil exploration still an idea: Seoul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea has no firm data on any oil reserves in North Korea and it is far too soon to talk about joint exploration in the reclusive state, officials in Seoul said on Monday. Officials from the two Koreas discussed possible cooperation in looking for oil in the North when South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun visited Pyongyang last week for the second only summit meeting between Korean leaders. "I understand the discussion was about an idea rather than a concrete plan," said an oil development official at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE). "The government doesn't have any official data showing whether North Korea has oil, so it is too early for us to call it a plan," said the official, who declined to be named. Finance Minister Kwon O-kyu, who represented the South's economic ministries during the Oct. 2-4 summit, told YTN cable news channel late last week that Roh and North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, had expressed interest in the idea. "We didn't insist that the joint statement include the issue because there were already many projects to mention, but the two leaders clearly expressed their interest," Kwon said. Neither Koreas produce oil. South Korea is the world's fourth-biggest crude oil buyer and relies wholly on imports to feed its energy-hungry economy, the world's 13th-largest. Pyongyang, which treats economic data as state secret, has never released any official information on potential oilfields and imports all its crude from China to feed its one working refinery. SIGNS OF OIL? Seoul's state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) said in a statement North Korea had found signs of oil in submarine blocks off the country's western coast, though it said the information was for reference. The energy ministry official said there were various media reports and private documents containing information on the potential oil reserves in North Korea, including one from China putting North Korea's oil reserves at up to 6 billion barrels. The official could not elaborate on the source. South Korea imported 888 million barrels of crude oil in 2006 and the North about 4 million, figures from the South's central bank shows. KNOC said in the statement Australian and Swedish companies had carried out explorations for oil in North Korea in the 1980s but all have since given up. It said an Irish company obtained the right to produce and distribute oil in North Korea in 2005, including sea territories, but has not released any achievement since. It named the company as Aminex but did not provide further information on the company. Aminex's Web site shows it is an upstream oil and gas firm listed on the London and Irish stock exchanges, which has operated internationally since 1991, and has produced oil and gas in the United States, with ongoing exploration works in Tanzania, North Korea, Madagascar Egypt and Kenya. Other than oil, South Korea has also been seeking ways to develop and benefit from rich mineral resources in North Korea. Earlier during the meeting, North Korea called for joint exploration of its mineral resources with the South, a possibility Seoul estimates could cut its annual mineral import costs by 2 trillion won ($2.19 billion). Under a agreement to end its nuclear weapons programme, North Korea could receive up to 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil from the international community. ($1=915.1 W
