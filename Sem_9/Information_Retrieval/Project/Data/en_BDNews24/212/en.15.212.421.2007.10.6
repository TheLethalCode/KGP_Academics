<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  FBCCI, the country's apex business body, Saturday said financial penalties through the Truth Commission were an acceptable alternative to jail terms for corrupt businessmen. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Saturday said it welcomed the government's Truth Commission initiative. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told reporters at the organisation's office Saturday: "The economy must be kept operational alongside the continuing drive against corruption." "The economy is facing a depression as businessmen have been detained on charges of corruption. Many businesses are facing closure. If the government takes this step, we will welcome it." Referring to a meeting between government and businessmen in early September the FBCCI president said: "At that meeting, businessmen held frank discussions with the chief adviser and the army chief. "The FBCCI always wants government cooperation to keep the economy dynamic. The government is considering forming a Truth Commission in light of this." The business leader said that there had been precedents for such a move in other countries. "There is logic behind being lenient to those who are compelled to resort to corruption because of the environment." Hossain underscored the need to continue the anticorruption drive but said: "The Truth Commission could be formed so that the economy isn't adversely affected by it." He hoped that the form and functions of the Truth Commission would be decided on the basis of discussions between the government and all sections of society including the business community, the legal community and civil society. bdnews24.
