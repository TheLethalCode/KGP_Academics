 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh drew 1-1 with favourites Tajikistan Monday in the World Cup pre-qualifier at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Bangladesh will play the away match in Tajikistan on October 28. Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan announced a Tk 1.5 lakh prize for the team. After a barren first half, midfielder Jumratul Islam Mithu gave Bangladesh the lead on a slippery pitch five minutes into the second half. But the lead did not survive long and Tajik playmaker Hakimov Numondzhon drew level in the 57th minute converting a penalty shot. Both side struggled to control the ball on wet field amid drizzle at the crowd-less big bowl, but the hosts enjoyed a superior ball possession in the second half. They took the lead through fluent passing of Jahid, Ameli and Mithu. Taking the ball from a right-side cross from speedy winger Jahid, striker Ameli backheeled for Mithu, who flicked the ball home to give Bangladesh a stunning lead in the 50th minute. "I feel very lucky to have done something for the nation," said veteran Mithu, who debuted in the country's premier football league in 1997. Bangladesh's hope for an improbable win against Tajikistan, however, faded seven minutes later when Omanis referee Abdullah Mohamed awarded a penalty to the central Asian country after Jahid pushed Vasiev Dilshod inside the danger zone. Tajik playmaker Hakimov Numondzhon did not make mistake in slotting home the spot. Bangladesh could have left the field with a victory had Abul Hossain not missed the target from a close-range one minute from time. "It is always a pleasure to see a victory, I am no exception," said Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin at a post-match briefing. "I, however, feel proud of their success despite having lack of facilities. The boys tried their best and I salute their efforts," said the former Indian national coach. "Yes, both teams failed to play their real game on such a pitch, but my boys could not finish despite launching some good attacks," said Nayeemuddin. Bangladesh, who suffered a humiliating 6-1 drubbing at the hands of Tajikistan in the same venue back in 2006 in the AFC Challenge Cup, had said they would look for at least a draw. bdnew
