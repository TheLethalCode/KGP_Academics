 HYDERABAD, India, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia overcame Yuvraj Singh's superb 121 to clinch a 47-run win over India in the third one-dayer on Friday, taking a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. Andrew Symonds lashed 89 from 67 balls to power the one-day champions to 290 for seven. India, after a poor start, were 243 all out in 47.4 overs. Yuvraj, who hit a hundred in a losing cause against South Africa at the venue two years ago, raised hopes for India's first win over Australia since early 2004 after strike bowler Brett Lee's double strike had reduced the innings to 13 for three. Lee removed opener Gautam Gambhir (6) and Rahul Dravid (0) and Mitchell Johnson claimed Robin Uthappa (0) at the other end. Yuvraj added 95 for the fourth wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (43) and 65 runs for the next wicket with skipper Mahendra Dhoni (33), but both were out at crucial moments. Left-arm spinner Brad Hogg made the first breakthrough when he bowled Tendulkar trying to make room for a cut and then Lee, back for a fresh spell, had the dangerous Dhoni caught behind. Yuvraj played shots all around the wicket, hitting three sixes and 12 fours, until he was bowled by left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson to be eighth man out. Lee and Hogg finished with three wickets each. BRUTE POWER Symonds, 32, again displayed brute power in the final overs having scored 87 to be joint top-scorer with Brad Haddin in the 84-run second ODI win. He took over after left-arm paceman Irfan Pathan's twin strikes pegged Australia back in the middle overs as captain Ricky Ponting looked rusty in making 25 off 43 balls. It was his first match since a hamstring injury sidelined him during the Twenty20 World Cup last month. Australia dropped Haddin despite the reserve stumper scoring 69 and 87 not out in the last two games and retained Brad Hodge, who however failed for the third game in a row. Symonds hit two consecutive sixes and a four to take 21 runs off Yuvraj's one over as 83 runs came in the last 10 overs before he was out off the penultimate ball to paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, who took wickets off the last two deliveries. Fellow seamers Zaheer Khan and Pathan also finished with two wickets each. The fourth one-dayer will be played in Chandigarh on Monday
