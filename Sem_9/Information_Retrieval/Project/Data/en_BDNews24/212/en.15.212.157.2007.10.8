<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Private banks Monday assured garment factory owners of providing them with loans at a low interest rate to pay wages and bonuses to workers before the Eid. The chief executives of private banks disclosed this to reporters after a meeting with the leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. At the time, BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury said: "In the last few months, export orders for garments have dropped substantially." "Owners of a good number of garment factories have informed the BGMEA that they will not be able to pay salaries and bonuses to the workers without bank loans." "We sat at an emergency meeting with the chief executives of all banks on the issue and requested the bankers to give loans to factories facing problems at 7 percent interest before the Eid. They have assured us of providing loans." Managing Director of Standard Bank, Mosharraf Hossain, who is the vice president of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), an organisation of the executives of the private banks, said, "The garment industry in the country flourished with private bank financing." "Many factory owners are unable to pay wages and bonuses for lack of cash. They want loans at relatively low interest. Necessary measures will be taken following emergency board meetings of the banks." Asked whether loans would be given at 7 percent interest, he said: "It is a matter to be considered by the boards. However, we will surely view the matter from a humane angle." Prime Bank managing director Shahjahan Bhuiyan said: "At the meeting, the garment factory owners told us that the crisis in the garment industry is temporary. The crisis will not persist after November." The BGMEA president said: "If the banks provide the garment industries with loans, there won't be fears for labour unrest." bdnews
