<TITLE> Positive mindset crucial for sub-continent success-Smith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa skipper Graeme Smith said a positive mindset has given his team a better shot at success in the sub-continent. "We have lost quite a few matches in the sub-continent. We lost here (Lahore) in 2003," said Smith. "But our whole performance of playing in the sub-continent has changed. Our mindset has changed. We play spin better and score runs off spinners." While South Africa have won in Bangladesh, their last series win against a major power in the sub-continent came in India seven years ago. "It is a huge card knowing we lost at this ground three to four years ago. But the players are hungry for runs and wickets," he added. "There is healthy competition in the team." Smith said his team expected a hard battle from Pakistan but that South Africa would play positively and try to win the series 2-0. South Africa won the first test in Karachi by 160 runs
