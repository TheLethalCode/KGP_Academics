 Maruf Mallick and Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com staff correspondents Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Buddhists in Bangladesh are shocked and enraged at the recent excesses committed by the Myanmar military junta but are divided on the question of taking part in protests. Some senior religious leaders say Buddhist monks should avoid political conflict and instead "seek a peaceful solution", while younger monks want to register their protests over the atrocities in the Southeast Asian state. Local Buddhists consider the Myanmar military excesses, including the deaths of protestors, 'barbaric and brutal' and say no civilised society should accept such savagery. They are shocked that in a Buddhist-majority country such as Myanmar monks are being shot at and killed. Bangladesh Bhikkhu Sangharaj Mahasava president Sotyopriyo Mahathero told bdnews24.com Friday: "The Myanmar government will be punished one day for its recent actions." While most local Buddhists believe such atrocities should be protested, Bangladesh's leading Buddhist monks are do not favour staging any protests themselves due to the state of emergency. They also believe senior Buddhist monks in Myanmar did not take part in the protests as their religion states they should avoid political conflict. "We are profoundly shocked at the havoc the Myanmar military junta wrought of late and we mourn the deaths of the Buddhist monks," president of Bangladesh Bouddha Krishti Prochar Sangha, Shuddhananda Mahathero told bdnews24.com. "But in view of the state of emergency in Bangladesh at the moment, we don't think we should do anything more in this regard," said Mahathero who is also the head of Dhaka Kamalapur Dharmarajik Buddhist Mahavihar The monks at Kamalapur monastery told bdnews24.com that they had been closely observing the Myanmar events. Some sounded disappointed at the monks' involvement in the public protests there. BKPS secretary general Dr PK Barua told bdnews24.com that they were in favour of a peaceful solution to the current crisis in Myanmar. Some Bangladeshi monks say senior, older monks were not so closely involved in the recent protests there. The top Buddhist religious leader said, "Our formal reaction will soon be expressed after a high-level meeting among the Buddhist monks." "The monks should avoid political conflict," he added. Upa Shangharaj Gyanosri Mohashtobir, principal of Chittagong Buddhist Monastery and the second most senior leader of local Buddhists, told bdnews24.com Friday: "We are all upset about the brutal killings in Myanmar." He expressed deep grief and consolation for the tortured monks and their families. "The harsh crackdown was a sin on the part of Myanmar government. We should find a peaceful way to solve our problems." However, he also said that religious monks should not have political ties. "The monks could have advised their government to stop their unlawful activities." "The Buddhist religion clearly states that we should obey our political leaders, and not be involved in political activities," he said. Proggatishsho Sthabir, a monk from Belkhan, Patiya, said he thought what the Myanmar junta did was "wrong". But, he said, "There is no space for politics in the Buddhist religion." However, Prokarannya Bhikkhu, from Rangunia, disagreed. "It is important to stage protests here as well. We need to stop the ongoing conspiracy going against the monks. The monks should raise their voice in any national crisis." "The monks can definitely take to the streets to stand by the people. But they should avoid bloodshed and should choose the peaceful way," he added. Middle-aged monk Dipanga said, "The leadership might be changed, so what? Monks should not keep quiet when the attack is on the religion. The religious leaders should analyse the situation over there and come to a conclusion." Ajit Ranjan Barua, chairman of Bangladesh Buddhist Samity, said, "The attack on innocent, peace-loving monks was unethical. Though it was an internal matter of Myanmar, the military should not have done it." He hoped the military government would resolve the problem through discussion with the religious leaders of Myanmar. He thought that it would be harmful if that country blended politics with religion. bdnews24.com/mrf/
