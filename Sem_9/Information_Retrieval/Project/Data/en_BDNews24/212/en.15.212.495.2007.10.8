<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday ruled out giving any tax incentives for reinvestment of profits by readymade garment entrepreneurs. "We've a vibrant stock market now. Please go to the capital market and raise the funds you need," Azizul told businessmen following their demand for tax incentives for reinvestment of their profits. The capital market is looking for new shares badly, he said. "So far as I know, no issue remains unsubscribed." The adviser was addressing a dialogue on "Bangladesh's apparel sector in the post-MFA period" organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "Investors have a huge interest in new shares, but companies are not coming" Azizul said. "You don't need tax incentives if you enlist your companies in the capital market." He said a listed company gets 10 percent tax waiver over unlisted ones. RMG entrepreneurs at the dialogue also demanded a cut in bank interest rates, which the finance adviser refused. "A cut or a hike in the rate is neither the job of the Bangladesh Bank nor of the government," Azizul said. Banks determine the rate by themselves, he added. He also said a reduction in default loans would cut the interest rate. bdn
