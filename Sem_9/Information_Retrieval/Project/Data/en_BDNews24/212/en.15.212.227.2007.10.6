<TITLE> Is Nokia Siemens on the skids? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick London, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Rumours have been circulating in the industry to the effect that Siemens is looking to make an early exit from its strategic union with Nokia of Finland. The scuttlebutt gained credence when the big German trades union, IG Metall, that counts many Siemens' staff amongst its numbers, announced that the company will rid itself of its 50 per cent interest in Nokia Siemens Networks as part of a "critical review of the assets and strategies of the company" being undertaken by its new chief executive, Peter Loescher. Herr Loescher says his intent is to cut, kill and close down "non-core ventures". The many rumours about the state of the partnership between Siemens and Nokia notwithstanding, given its strategic importance to both parties, it is hard to imagine that the joint venture could be considered as anything other than a "core venture". The jv agreement stipulates that an early termination of the deal can be effected only by mutual consent and common agreement, and this seems very unlikely to be forthcoming. The fact is that Siemens is contractually tied to remain in the partnership for six years at a minimum. That agreement runs from April this year, when the jv became operational, through to 2013. The stakes are high and it would be enormously expensive for Siemens to renege on the agreement now, a mere six months after it came into being. In addition to monetary penalties, the German side of the partnership would be left thrashing about looking for a new strategy whilst Nokia could be forced to take on a second (and "second-best") partner or pay  10 billion to purchase the Siemens' stake. Nonetheless, speculation continues with the German press and stock market apparently convinced that there's no smoke without fire. That said, Nokia's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Simonson speaking on a conference call only a month ago stressed that both companies are happy with the six year tie-up. But that was then and this is now, and if a week's a long time in politics, a month is a lifetime in telecoms. Nokia and Siemens agreed in June 2006 to set up the 50:50 joint venture in an effort to gain the economies of scale necessary to compete fully in the cut-throat market for telecoms networks. At the time, which analysts' valued the jv at up to  25 billion. Finnish analysts say the partnership is unlikely to be dissolved anytime soon, not least because the venture is in the middle of an expensive and disruptive major restructuring. They also point out that the price of Siemens' half of the business should and will be less than what it was when the venture was first set up. The company has spent the past months writing down the value of its assets and pushing through an expensive redundancy programme in a effort to hit its target of  1.5 billion by the end of 2008. It is also worth noting that the top management at Nokia Siemens is predominantly Finnish rather than German, as is the composition of the board. And, as they say, turkeys don't usually vote in favour of Christmas.
