 THANH HOA, Sun Oct 7, Vietnam (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A typhoon followed by floods and landslides killed up to 67 people in Vietnam, cut power and closed roads in some of the worst flooding in decades, officials said on Sunday. The government storm prevention committee said that at least 19 people were missing in the aftermath of typhoon Lekima, which slammed several provinces on Wednesday night. Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces in north-central Vietnam were hit hardest by torrential rains and strong winds blowing off roofs and then flooding submerged entire villages. "This may be the worst flooding since 1945," said Phan Dang Khoa, a Communist Party official in Thach Thanh district of Thanh Hoa where a dyke on the Buoi river broke, causing extensive flooding. Khoa said the river rose to 14.25 metres (46 ft 9 in), almost 2.5 metres (8 ft 2.42 in) higher than the highest level. A Reuters cameraman and photographer on the scene said most houses were submerged in murky brown water. Many people sat on roof tops with their meagre belongings. Helicopters have dropped dry food supplies such as instant noodles to stranded villagers and rescuers waded through chest-high water to help people to safety. The underdeveloped Southeast Asian country of 85 million faces up to 10 storms a year that cause millions of dollars in damage and kill hundreds of people. Lekima was the fifth of 2007, but flooding and landslides in the aftermath have been even more devastating. The storm and floods destroyed about 100,000 homes mainly in central provinces and 15,000 ha of rice crops. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Hanoi said some people who were evacuated last week before the typhoon and returned home, had again been evacuated. "The situation is worse that first estimated," said Irja Sandberg, country representative for IFRC. In Nghe An, large swathes of land were also inundated. "We have not seen flooding like this in 20 years," Nghe An provincial official Nguyen Xuan Hanh said by mobile phone as he sat stuck in a car. "It was so fast and so out of the blue." A storm and subsequent floods in August killed nearly 80 people in several central provinces, including Nghe An. At the time, officials said hundreds of thousands faced food shortag
