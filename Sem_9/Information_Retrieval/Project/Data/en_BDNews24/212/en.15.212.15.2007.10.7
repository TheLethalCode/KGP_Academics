 BEIJING, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Typhoon Krosa crashed into the Chinese coast on Sunday, forcing the evacuation of 1.4 million people, after killing five in Taiwan as it lashed the island with heavy rain and high winds. The typhoon made landfall near the borders of densely populated Zhejiang and Fujian provinces in southeast China around 0730 GMT, packing winds of up to 126 km per hour (78 kph), before weakening. No casualties were reported and the local flood prevention authorities later downgraded Krosa to a common tropical storm as it lost strength moving north at 20 km an hour, Xinhua news agency reported.

Krosa earlier wrought havoc in Taiwan as a category 4 typhoon.
