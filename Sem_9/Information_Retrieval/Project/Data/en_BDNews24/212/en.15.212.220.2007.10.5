 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Friday said the Malaysian government's recent ban on importing manpower from Bangladesh was a 'freeze' that he hoped would soon be reversed. He said ensuring the welfare of Bangladeshis working abroad was the responsibility of the government. In a statement released from New York, he said: "In our view, the welfare of Bangladeshis anywhere in the world is a major responsibility of the government. This includes the workers in Malaysia." "The Malaysian authorities in New York have stressed to me that it is not a 'ban' but a 'freeze', which implies possibilities of relaxation in the future," said Iftekhar. It was time to review the issues linked to export of manpower in Malaysia to ensure that the interests of Bangladeshi workers there were protected, said the adviser. The adviser confirmed that the Malaysian government has told the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur that the suspension order is not be applicable in the case of those workers who have already received permission to go to Malaysia. Iftekhar said the government was aware of the Malaysian government's decision to suspend intake of Bangladeshi workers, but had also been concerned for quite sometime that Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia were being subjected to exploitation and deprivation. "Our worker is not simply a revenue-generating machine and he or she must be protected from any form of exploitation, first and foremost." He said the government was 'concerned' about the rising allegations of exploitation of Bangladeshi worker in Malaysia. The government contacted Malaysian authorities recently in Dhaka, Kuala Lumpur and New York on the export of manpower to Malaysia, according to the foreign adviser's statement. Iftekhar, who is in New York to attend the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, is expected to return home Oct 8. bdnews24.
