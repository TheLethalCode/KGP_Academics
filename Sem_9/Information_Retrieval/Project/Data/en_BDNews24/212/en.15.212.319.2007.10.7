<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Professor Nazrul Islam from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Sunday said the issue of HIV/Aids allowed people to talk about stigma, human rights and gender issues more freely. "The issue has benefited us in one way. It has allowed us to discuss stigma, human rights and gender issues more freely than before," he said in his address to the launch of a new book on HIV/Aids by regional journalists. Prof Nazrul, an adviser on the project, said: "We must learn more and create a bigger role for journalists." Panos South Asia, an organisation that promotes debate on a wide range of issues, launched the book that tackles issues affecting Aids sufferers. Supported by the United Nations Development Programme, the project aims to encourage better journalistic understanding of the issues surrounding Aids in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Speakers at the launching ceremony said most countries in South Asia are still defined as 'low prevalence states'. However, they said this jargon does not carry much meaning when the overall numbers of affected individuals in the region are taken into account. Dr Julia Ahmed from the Bangladesh Women's Health Coalition said: "There should be a mechanism in place to carry out monitoring by journalists on the work of HIV/Aids in the country." "This will bring more accountability to the agencies responsible for this work," Ahmed said. Nine journalists from the three countries contributed their articles to the book, "Miles to go", a research product on HIV/Aids in the region by journalists. bdnew
