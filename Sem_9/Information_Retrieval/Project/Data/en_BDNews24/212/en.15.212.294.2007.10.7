<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh are looking forward to fare better after a humiliating 6-1 drubbing by Tajikistan in the AFC Challenge Cup when they take on the same rivals in the World Cup pre-qualifier at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. ATN, a private satellite TV channel, will telecast the match live from the venue at 3pm. "It was a bad day for Bangladesh against Tajikistan in the AFC Challenge Cup in Dhaka in 2006. But this time we hope to put up a fight and play for at least a draw," said Bangladesh captain Hasan Al Mamun Sunday at a press conference at the BFF House ahead of the match. "The fighting attitude is our main strength as we have gained a lot of fitness and power through hard training in Cox's Bazar and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan for one month," said the defender. Mamun will lead a full-strength Bangladesh team after having had a depleted side at his disposal in the Mardeka Cup in Malaysia in August. The veteran defender, however, said a lack of practice matches have denied them of the opportunity to settle into the best possible combination. "It could have been better had we got some warm-up matches for a right combination for the side. [In that case] we could have known our strengths and weaknesses," Mamun said. "However, I think the boys are mentally and physically fit enough to put up a good show against Tajikistan." Bangladesh's Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin was also optimistic but said his boys would play for a win. "This match is like any other match and the boys will play for a win and try not to give any room to the opponents during the match," said Nayeemuddin. The coach said the mentality, sincerity and winning attitude of the boys have made him to hope to come out with the full points at stake. Bangladesh have failed to even manage a draw, let alone a win, against the Central Asian country in three matches they have played. Tajik captain Dzhabarov Numondzhon was confident of stretch their winning streak over Bangladesh. "Yes, we won against them by a big margin in the last meeting. I believe Bangladesh have improved a lot by this time and are now more prepared to face us. "But I am optimistic about a victory over them," Numondzhon told reporters at a press conference through an interpreter. The 34-year old Tajik captain, however, was worried over weather in Bangladesh and thought that it might affect their performance. "The humidity here is higher than in Tajikistan that has an average temperature of 22 to 25 degrees Celsius this time. The heat in Bangladesh may affect our natural game," said the Tajik playmaker. Tajikistan head coach Khabibulloev Makhmadjon said he saw Bangladesh's two matches in the Nehru Cup in India and had some idea about their opponents. "We have come here to perform better and we are confident to play the World Cup qualifying round beating Bangladesh," said Makhmadjon. He added that before coming to Dhaka his side had played two warm-up matches against Kazakhstan (1-1 draw) and Azerbaijan (3-2 loss). Bangladesh had lost to the mountainous, landlocked country in the Germany World Cup pre-qualifying round with an identical 2-0 score line on both occasions. In the qualifying round, Tajikistan had won against Kyrgyztan (3-0 home, 2-0 away), lost to Syria (1-0 home, 3-1 away) and lost 2-0 and drawn 0-0 against Bahrain. bd
