<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Intern doctors at Sylhet MAG Osmany Medical College Hospital went on a half-day strike Friday to demand security for on-duty doctors but called it off later after authorities conceded. They withdrew the strike, triggered by an altercation with the relatives of a patient, after hospital authorities had given in to their demand to hand the relative who allegedly misbehaved with them. Witnesses said the wife of Syed Abdul Gafur of Golapganj was admitted to the hospital at 5am Friday. At the time of admission, relatives had an altercation with on-duty intern doctor Asif Iqbal about posting a round-the-clock attendant for the patient. When news of the incident spread, the interns instantly decided to go on a strike, demanding punishment to one of the relatives that Iqbal claimed physically had assaulted him. The strike that was enforced at 8am left the hospital with no on-duty intern doctors, who also staged a sit-in on the hospital premises. Hospital director Brig Gen Shah-e-Alam, deputy director Dr Md Mahfuzur Rahman and head of the gynaecology department Dr Shamsunnahar went to assess the situation at about 10am. The striking doctors at the time threatened to call an indefinite strike if their demand was not met. They demanded that the authorities ensure their security at work. The authorities and the interns had a meeting at about 11:30am, attended also by Kotwali policemen. After the meeting the patient's relative, Abdul Gafur, was handed in to the police and the intern doctors went back on duty. Hospital director Shah-e-Alam said: "As we instantly accepted the intern doctors' demands they withdrew the strike. Now the situation is back to normal." Sub-inspector of Kotwali Police Station Abdul Ahad confirmed that hospital authorities had turned Gafur in to them. bdnews24.c
