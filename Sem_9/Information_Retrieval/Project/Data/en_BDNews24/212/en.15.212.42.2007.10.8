 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were flat on Monday but Asian equities hit another all-time high as investors generally put aside worries about credit markets and banked on future corporate and global economic growth. The dollar picked up against major currencies following Friday's stronger than expected U.S. jobs report which calmed fears about a significant downturn the world's largest economy and dampened expectations of an interest rate cut. "The payrolls numbers have reduced fears that the US economy is heading into recession," said Michael Klawitter, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. Data showed the US economy added 110,000 new jobs in September and hiring in each of the two previous months was revised up significantly, showing a more resilient labour market than previously thought. This eased one of the two big concerns of investors at the moment -- that the US economy could slide and pull down growth elsewhere. The second concern -- widespread problems stemming from a credit squeeze -- currently appears contained. Investors are likely to be looking this week at US data that should give some hint about how US consumers have been reacting to the credit problemss. Retails sales and consumer confidence reports are due on Friday. In the meantime, stocks ticked over in Europe. Early gains were wiped after German software group SAP unveiled a deal to buy French rival Business Objects, triggering cost and profit concerns. It left the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares flat to slightly lower. Asian stocks outside of Japan, however, hit record highs in keeping with the flood of money moving into emerging markets since the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. The dollar ticked up versus the euro and the yen on the more upbeat view of the US economy. It has been historically weak in part because of expectations for lower interest rates that would make some dollar-denominated assets less rewarding. Signs that European officials are growing increasingly worried about the euro's elevated levels also kept the single European currency from making further gains. The euro was down 0.18 percent at $1.4110, more than a cent and a half below last week's record highs. The dollar index against major currencies firmed to 78.462, moving further away from record lows of 77.6 60 set earlier this month. Euro zone government bonds drifted lower in thin volume after sharp sell-off on Friday on the back of the jobs report. Traders expected little action on Monday with US bond markets closed for the Columbus Day holiday. The interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was up 2.8 basis points at 4.063 percent. The 10-year Bund yield was up 1.4 basis points at 4.366 perce
