 CHANDIGARH, India, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India pulled off a tense eight-run win over Australia in the fourth one-day international on Monday to cut the tourists' lead to 2-1 in the seven-match series. Sachin Tendulkar top-scored with 79 and helped India reach a solid 291 for four after batting first on a slow pitch before Australia were restricted to 283 for seven. India skipper Mahendra Dhoni made 50 not out from 35 balls and made two stumpings to be named man of the match. Australian opener Matthew Hayden top-scored with 92 and Andrew Symonds hit 75, their third fifties in a row, to keep their team on course for victory. However, left-arm paceman Rudra Pratap Singh bowled Symonds and ran out Brad Hogg (0) off his next delivery in the 47th over, leaving Australia needing 24 runs off 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. They were left to get 16 runs in the last over bowled by left-armer Zaheer Khan, but managed to get only seven. It was India's first win over the world champions since January 2006, a streak of 11 games, and it was Australia's first defeat in 14 50-over matches dating back to March. Tendulkar added 91 runs with fellow opener Saurav Ganguly, who made 41 on his return from an injury that later prevented him from fielding. The 34-year-old also added 83 runs for the next wicket with Yuvraj Singh, who made 39. Australian bowlers sent down 31 wides to tally 39 extras, just one short of their worst-ever mark. Tendulkar hit seven fours in his 119-ball knock until he was run out by a direct hit from Brett Lee at fine leg. It was some relief for the Australian strike bowler, who was unlucky not to have removed him twice before reaching double figures. He went on to reach a record 84th one-day fifty, surpassing Pakistan's Inzamam-ul Haq. Ricky Ponting (29) joined Hayden to add 85 runs for the second wicket until he was stumped off left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan. Hayden was caught in the deep with his team 101 runs adrift. Symonds batted sensibly, hitting just three fours and a six in his 84-ball effort, but his dismissal turned the game. The fifth one-dayer will be played in Baroda on Thursday
