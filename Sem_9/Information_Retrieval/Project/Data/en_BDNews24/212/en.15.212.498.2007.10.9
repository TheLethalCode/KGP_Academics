 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnew24.com)  A special court dealing with high-profile corruption Tuesday sentenced former BNP lawmaker Manjurul Ahsan Munshi to 13 years in jail for having undeclared assets and suppressing information. Mohammad Ashraf Hossain, the judge of Special Judge's Court 5, relieved Munshi's wife Mazeda Ahsan and two sons Rezaonul Ahsan and Rizviul Ahsan of the charges in the same case. The court asked authorities to free Mazeda from jail if there was no case against her. The verdict, which had earlier been deferred twice as the judge had been ill, is the latest in scores of graft cases pursued by the Anticorruption Commission in its bid to crack down on corruption mostly by politicians and businessmen. The court also fined Munshi Tk 65 lakh and he would have to serve another year in prison if he failed to pay the fine. Munshi got 10 years for illegally acquiring wealth and three years for suppressing information about that wealth. On Feb 3, security officials arrested Munshi but their two sons were at large. On July 8, Mazeda turned herself in to the court. ACC assistant director Abu Sayeed filed the case against Munshi, wife and two sons with Gulshan Police Station on March 27. Police charged them with corruption at Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on June 17. According to case details, Munshi concealed wealth information of around Tk 3.13 crore and illegally acquired Tk 5.37 crore assets. After the case was transferred to the Special Judges' Court set up at the Sangsad Bhaban, the court framed the charges on July 9. The deposition started on July 10 and ended on August 6. On Aug 13, Munshi and his wife in their statement pleaded their innocence. bdnews24
