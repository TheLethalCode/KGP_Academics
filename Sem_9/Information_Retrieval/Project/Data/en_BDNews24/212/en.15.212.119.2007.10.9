 SINGAPORE, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares outside Japan dipped on Tuesday, taking a breather after their ascent to record highs the previous day, while the dollar crept lower against the yen as investors bet on further US interest rate cuts by year-end. European stock markets are set to open flat to higher and take direction from Wall Street, given a dearth of corporate and economic news. Financial bookmakers see Germany's DAX opening up 3 to 19 points, France's CAC 40 unchanged to up 12 points and Britain's FTSE gaining 10 to 16 points. Minutes from the Fed's September meeting due later in the day could shed some light on whether the US central bank is likely to cut interest rates again in October. Japan's Nikkei average ended up 0.6 percent, led by Fast Retailing Co Ltd and Softbank Corp as Tokyo caught up with Friday's record-setting rally on Wall Street. Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday. But MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had slipped 0.2 percent by 0550 GMT, after hitting a record high on Monday and extending year-to-date gains to more than 38 percent. "There is relief selling taking place at this point," said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities. "These investors don't pay attention to whether the market will go higher. After being hit hard, they are happy to unload shares now that share prices recovered to the point at which they bought them." Seoul shares ended steady, after earlier hitting a record, as chip makers extended losses on worries over the profitability of the memory chip sector. Tech woes also plagued Taiwan stocks, which fell 0.8 percent, as analysts feared a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. Bucking the trend, Australian shares rose 0.35 percent to a record finish as gains in banking shares, such as National Australia Bank Ltd, overshadowed declines in mining firms. Singapore stocks rose 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong shares were flat. DOLLAR DROPS VS YEN Against the yen, the dollar fell on selling by Japanese exporters returning to work after a three-day weekend. The greenback fell against the yen to 117.13 down 0.2 percent from late New York levels, pulling away from a two-month peak of 117.61 yen reached on Monday. The dollar edged up against the euro as a solid US jobs report late last week eased concerns about a possible recession in the United States. But the US currency's gains were curbed because investors were not yet convinced the American economy was growing fast enough to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates again late this month. "Even though September jobs data was stronger than expected, that data alone did not completely wipe out the possibility of a Fed interest rate cut in October," said Tsutomu Soma, a senior manager of foreign securities at Okasan Securities. The euro was at $1.4021, down 0.26 percent from late US trade on Monday and well below a record high of $1.4283 hit on electronic trading platform EBS last week. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.22 percent to 78.848, above an all-time low of around 77.660 struck last week. Japanese government bond futures fell to a near two-month low, tracking a fall in US Treasuries late last week while a jump in Tokyo's shares hurt sentiment. December 10-year futures were down 0.20 point at 134.53 after tumbling as low as 134.14 earlier in the session, the lowest level since Aug. 13. US crude futures fell 22 cents to $78.80 a barrel, after slumping almost 3 percent the previous session amid a broad commodities sell-off. Gold fell to $730.20/730.80 an ounce, from $732.80/$733.60 in late New York trade.
