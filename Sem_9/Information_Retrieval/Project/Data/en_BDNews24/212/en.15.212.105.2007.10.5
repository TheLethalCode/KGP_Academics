<TEXT>
 Savar, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Workers Friday vandalised a garment factory at Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) in Savar demanding payment of arrear salaries and Eid bonus. Similar protests were reported from another factory. Savar Police Station sub-inspector Moniruzzaman said about 1,500 workers of Panna Textiles owned by former Awami League MP Makbul Hossain staged protests at around 7:30am when authorities agreed to disburse only half a month's arrear salary. The agitating workers vandalised the factory installations and marched out on the highway in processions. The police, however, brought the situation under control. "The higher authorities asked us to tell the workers that they'd be paid half a month's salary now. What can I do when the owners say they're unable to pay arrear salaries and bonus at a time?" Panna Textiles general manager Khaled Khan told bdnews24.com. In another incident, 145 workers of 'Fashion Toys', a municipal area factory at Imandipur assembled at the main gate of the factory at around 8am demanding two months' arrear salaries. When Savar police chief Abul Khair intervened, authorities assured the workers that they would be paid their dues and the protesters dispersed. Firoz Miah, the factory director, told reporters that the workers would get their salaries by Sunday. bdnews24.co
