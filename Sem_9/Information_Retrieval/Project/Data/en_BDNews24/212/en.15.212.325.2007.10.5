<TITLE> Whatmore in frame for Indian academy job </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India are hoping to rope in former Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore as director of operations of their national cricket academy, the Indian board said on Friday. Australian Whatmore, 53, had earlier been seen as a successor to Greg Chappell, who quit as coach of the Indian team after the first-round exit in the 50-over World Cup in the Caribbean in March. But Whatmore was surprisingly not even short-listed for the post when South African Graham Ford turned the job down in June. India have been without a coach since March and the board has advertised the post. "Ravi Shastri, after taking over as chairman of the national cricket academy (NCA), is in discussion with Dav Whatmore for appointment as director, Operations, at the NCA," the board said in a statement. Whatmore guided Sri Lanka to the World Cup in 1996 and helped unfancied Bangladesh reach the World Cup second round for the first time this year after a shock win over India. He decided not to renew his contract with Bangladesh, which ran out at the end of April, and had been keen to coach India. The Indian board, meanwhile, has formed a special committee comprising former captains to consider the 20 applications that have been received for the coach's job. The team is expected to have a full-time coach in place for the tour of Australia in December
