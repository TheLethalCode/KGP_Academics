<TITLE> Party reform must come from within: Butenis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)Patricia A Butenis Monday said she was in favour of reforms based on the needs felt within the political parties. Speaking after a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office, the outgoing US ambassador said reform within parties should not be dictated by outsiders. "It has to come from the parties themselves. I don't think you can impose change on them." Butenis said political parties being inseparable from the overall democratic environment should undergo reforms and implement beneficial measures despite difficulties. On indoor politics she said she had spoken her mind about the matter on earlier occasions and there was no further discussion on the matter at Monday's meeting. "I did raise human rights concerns," Butenis said, adding that the foreign adviser had assured her of positive investigations into the raised matters. "He also reassured me that the timeline for the election had not changed," she said. The outgoing ambassador said they had discussed how a roadmap for the elections needed to be "fleshed out" with respect to the changes that needed to be in place by 2008. Butenis said the meeting was a chance to review the two countries' bilateral relation. "We both agreed that Bangladesh and the US are friends in so many areas," she said, stressing in particular the common goal of fostering democracy. When asked to comment on the extradition of AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed in the Bangabandhu assassination case, she declined to make any comment. She only said it was an internal matter for Bangladesh. The foreign adviser said: "It was Ms Butenis' farewell meeting at the ministry after her 14-month stint as the US envoy to Bangladesh. We have thanked her for her positive role in strengthening the bilateral relationship during her tenure." On his discussion with Butenis on human rights issues Chowdhury said: "We assured the ambassador that the offenders of human rights will be duly punished after investigation. She was also informed of our preparations to set up an independent human rights commission in Bangladesh." Iftekhar said they discussed how the government would work out ways of fulfilling its promises to the nation. About the Mohiuddin case he said it had been the foreign ministry who notified the public about Mohiuddin's deportation to Bangladesh by the US government. "The long hand of the law will surely manage to reach faraway targets too," the adviser added with respect to extradition of others involved in the killing of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. bdnews24.com
