<TITLE> Only six people legalised untaxed money in two weeks: NBR </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) - The government has yet to receive any significant response to its special provision to legalise untaxed money for a period of two months until July 31. National Board of Revenue (NBR) officials blame higher tax rates and fear of the ongoing anti-graft drive for this poor response. "We have received barely any response up to Sunday despite the passage of more than two weeks since the provision was made," a senior tax official, asking not to be named, in Zone 3 told bdnews24.com. The NBR issued a statutory regulatory order (SRO) on June 5 offering the facility to legalise undisclosed income by paying a 5 percent penalty charge in addition to the normal tax rate. This facility has been offered under section 44(4) (B) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 in an attempt to bring the huge amount of undisclosed but legally earned money into the formal economy. Only half a dozen people have availed themselves of the facility up to the present, NBR officials said. "The NBR has so far received only about Tk 2 lakh in tax from those people who have legalised their undisclosed income," said a senior income tax official at the NBR preferring not to be named. Of the persons who have taken advantage of the facility, four are from Dhaka, one from Chittagong and another from a district town. "The tax rate is a major factor for this poor response," an official of Zone 2 told bdnews24.com. The income tax rate for individual earners is 10 percent for an annual income up to Tk 2.5 lakh, 15 percent for Tk 3 lakh, 20 percent for Tk 3.5 lakh and 25 percent for over Tk 3.5 lakh. Tax officials said the people who will most benefit from the legalisation of undeclared income are likely to be those in the highest tax rate category. "A person will have to pay 30 percent tax (including five percent penalty charge) for legalising Tk 3.5 lakh plus," the official in Zone 3 said. Therefore the NBR is mainly receiving only queries, he added. However NBR officials said that they are planning tougher measures, including confiscation of assets, against those who do not take advantage of the opportunity to legalise their undisclosed income within the given timeframe of July 31 this year. The previous government had offered a similar opportunity for the whitening of black money by paying a total of only 7.5 percent tax on it. But the provision was withdrawn on June 30 2006 following huge criticism from different quarters. According to NBR officials about Tk 4,500 crore was whitened during fiscal 2005-06 while the provision was in place. The present caretaker government has also abolished the facility to invest untaxed money in the purchase of land, apartments and motorcars. bdnews
