 PARIS, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy reshuffled his cabinet on Tuesday after losing a key minister in a parliamentary election and made former international lawyer Christine Lagarde France's first female economy minister. Just a month after naming his team, Sarkozy switched the previous economy chief Jean-Louis Borloo to run a new energy and environment mega-ministry in place of Alain Juppe who quit the government after losing his constituency in Sunday's poll. "You can't refuse an offer like that," Borloo was quoted as saying by the daily Le Parisien ahead of the announcement. Borloo becomes de facto deputy to Prime Minister Francois Fillon, even though some on the centre-right blame his unguarded comments on a possible value-added tax hike for their smaller-than-expected majority in the weekend election. Lagarde entered politics in 2005 as trade minister in the previous conservative administration and her assured handling of the brief meant she was given the tricky farms portfolio last month when Sarkozy unveiled his administration. Her promotion to economy minister was something of a surprise, and she must now sell economic reforms to the sceptical unions and convince EU partners that tax cuts will not stop Paris respecting the bloc's rules on fiscal discipline. Sarkozy also appointed 12 new junior ministers on Tuesday, drafting in figures from the centre, left and grass-roots groups, and naming French national rugby coach Bernard Laporte to become secretary of state for sport after the Rugby World Cup later this year. The economy post has been something of a revolving door in recent years and 51-year-old Lagarde, a top lawyer in the United States before entering government, is the seventh tenant of the ministry's massive Bercy complex since 2002. "She doesn't have much political weight yet but this doesn't matter in a context where it is the president and his prime minister who are in charge," said Eric Chaney, chief Europe economist at Morgan Stanley in London. Borloo, a former labour minister, had got off to a rocky start at Bercy, with officials complaining, off the record, that he was not paying enough attention to his massive portfolio. Among the dossiers Lagarde will inherit, are 11 billion euros ($14.74 billion) of tax breaks and a curb on corporate payouts, which will go before the new parliament this month. On election in May, Sarkozy wrong-footed the opposition by naming a number of centrists and leftists to a 16-strong cabinet, and he repeated the move on Tuesday when he completed his government line-up. Socialist senator Jean-Marie Bockel, the new secretary of state for cooperation and Francophone affairs, said he had joined the Sarkozy team because it was committed to genuine reform while his own party had failed to evolve. Sarkozy's pledge to make the government better mirror France's ethnic diversity was reflected in the appointment of Fadela Amara, founder of the "Neither Whores Nor Submissives" women's rights group, as secretary of state for towns. Rama Yade, 30, a rising star within Sarkozy's UMP party who is of Senegalese origin, became secretary of state for human rights. Justice Minister Rachida Dati, who is of North African origin, was confirmed in her p
