 June20, bdnews24.com/AFP)A US envoy said UN inspectors were set to return next Tuesday to North Korea to verify the shutting down of a nuclear reactor after a drawn-out row over frozen assets was resolved. Christopher Hill, the US pointman on North Korea, was optimistic on moving ahead with a disarmament deal, despite South Korea's report Tuesday that the communist state had tested another short-range missile.

Hill has said he hopes that six-nation disarmament talks will resume within weeks. China, the host of the talks and main ally of North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, welcomed Pyongyang's decision to allow the inspectors to return. "We believe the move shows the DPRK's political will to implement the February 13 joint document," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters Tuesd
