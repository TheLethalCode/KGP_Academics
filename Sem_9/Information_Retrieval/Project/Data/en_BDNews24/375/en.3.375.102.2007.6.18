 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Muktijoddha Sangsad KS stopped the surprising run of the bottom team Rahmatganj MFS in the B. League, handing a 3-1 defeat in the second-leg encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. The seventh win helped the All-Red outfit take solo lead in the 11-team point table with 25 points from 13 matches, two points ahead of the jointly second-placed Dhaka Abahani Limited , Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club and Sheikh Russel KC. Rahmatganj, who remained winless in the first leg and made two upsets beating Sheikh Russel KC and Arambagh KS in their first two matches of the second leg, kept Muktijoddha Sangsad goalless for 53 minutes before Alfaz Ahmed gave the freedom fighters' team a lead. Muktijoddha Sangsad employed five midfielders to foil giant-killer Rahmatganj attack at the midfield, but their strategy went in vain and brought the change in the second half to play 4-4-2 formation to leave the field with a happy mood. Getting a throw pass from Saifur Rahman Moni, Alfaz shrugged off defender Shoaib Hossain Sunny to fire home from a close range in the 53rd minute while Moni doubled the margin two minutes later with an eye-catching header after captitalising an Alfaz cross from the right. Rahmatganj which remained on eight points from 13 matches bounced back to reimburse a goal in the 59th minute with Nigerian striker Nche Francis firing home from a very close range utilising a Charles Ikogho header. Substitute Saiful Islam Saif sealed the victory three minutes from time as the right- winger raced past two Rahmatganj defenders to send the ball home with an angular shot. Muktijoddha Sangsad enjoyed a superior ball possession in the second half, but they survived from two scorable scares from the opponents. Besides, their striker duo -- Alfaz and Moni -- missed two easy targets. Muktijoddha coach Abu Yousuf expressed his satisfaction in the way his boys played. Rahmatganj coach-cum-manager Raizuddin, however, blamed the referee to lose the game and demanded foreign referees to conduct the match.
