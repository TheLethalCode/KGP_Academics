 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's export earnings have reached at $9.912 billion in the first 10 months of fiscal 2006-07, an official disclosure said Monday. The amount is an 18.5 percent rise from the same period of the previous fiscal year, the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) unveiled it at a meeting of the board of management. The target of earnings in export was $9.99 billion in the current fiscal year's July-April period, which means the shortfall is about $78 million.

According to the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, earnings in woven export accounted for about $3.81 billion while the knitwear sector's contribution was $3.66 billion during the period.
