<TITLE> Sri Lanka troops say they kill 70 rebels in a day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed around 30 Tamil Tigers in a clash overnight in jungle in the island's restive east, the military said on Wednesday, hours after the navy said it had killed around 40 insurgents in a sea battle. The military said soldiers had captured a rebel bunker line during the clash in a swathe of landlocked eastern jungle called Thoppigala, where Tiger fighters are still entrenched after the fall of their eastern stronghold. That fight in turn came hours after the navy said late on Tuesday it had destroyed five Tiger vessels after coming under attack from two dozen rebel boats off Sri Lanka's far northern tip. "We have captured an LTTE bunker line in Thoppigala. There are about 30 dead bodies," a military spokesman said, declining to be named in line with policy. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are fighting for an independent state in the island's north and east and are widely listed as a banned terrorist group, had no immediate comment on the military's claims. There was no independent confirmation of what had happened or of any casualties. The land battle and clash at sea off Point Pedro in the northern army-held Jaffna peninsula, which is cut off from the rest of the island by rebel lines, are the latest in a string of land and sea battles and air strikes in recent months. Fighting is now focused on the north after the military captured the Tigers' eastern stronghold earlier this year. Around 4,500 people have been killed since last year alone. The government has vowed to destroy the Tigers militarily, the rebels have threatened to use all of their means to battle the state -- which include suicide bombers and light aircraft smuggled into the country in pieces which have been used in a series of bombing raids. Analysts say there is no clear winner on the horizon and fear a conflict that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 could rumble on for years.
