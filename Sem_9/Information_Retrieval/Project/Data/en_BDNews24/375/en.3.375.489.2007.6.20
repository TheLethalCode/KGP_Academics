<TEXT>
 Colombo, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Former skipper Habibul Bashar took the Tigers out the woods with an unbeaten half-century as Bangladesh ended their tour opener against Sri Lanka A at 183 for five at stumps in the Colts Cricket Ground, Colombo. Bashar scored 60 with the help of only five fours in his 146-ball vigil. He will resume the innings with another former skipper Khaled Masud who was unbeaten on 7. Bangladesh had a poor start after skipper Mohammad Ashraful won the toss and chose to bat. Out-of-form opener Shariar Nafees was out for 16 in the seventh over off Dammika Prasad. Javed Omar and Rajin Saleh took on from there and put on 55 runs for the second wicket. But both of them perished in the space of three runs upfront in the second session. Omar was run out for 34 while Saleh fell to Rangana Herath, the first of his three wickets. Ashraful and Bashar steadied the innings with a partnership of 75 runs before Herath struck again. He had Ashraful (37) caught behind and with his next delivery got Sakib Al Hasan for a first-ball duck. Bashar however made sure his side ended the day with no more hiccups with the patient knock. bdn
