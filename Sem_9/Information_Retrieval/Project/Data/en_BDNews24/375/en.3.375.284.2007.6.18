 Patuakhali, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  The family of Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed was shocked at his deportation to the country from the United States. A spate of gloom gripped the family at his ancestral home in Patuakhali district Monday, as the news of his arrival in Dhaka flew fast. His 85-year-old mother was speechless after she heard about the son's arrival. The mother has no luck to hug her son since he landed in Dhaka central jail where some of his co-convicts of the brutal 1975-killing have been counting their days down. Words fell short when bdnews24.com sought comments from Mohiuddin's brothers in Patuakhali. "I'm disappointed to know that he has been deported," said Abdul Hye Talukder, one of his brothers and chairman of Rangabali Union Parishad in Patuakhali. "After all he's my brother," Taluker said, adding that Mohiuddin used to keep distance with the family over the past few years. Talukder said the family became anxious soon after his arrest on March 13in Los Angeles. Mohiuddin, sentenced in absentia for his role in the 1975 assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman but who pleaded his innocence, ran up against a legal brick wall in his bid for asylum in the US in recent months. He also tried to take asylum in Canada, and international human rights groups also voiced for his shelter in a third country. His relatives in North America and Liberal politicians in Canada shot their best in convincing the authorities to save his life, but all went in vain. Sabrina Ahmed, Mohiuddin's 30-year-old daughter, had appealed to the Canadian government: "You will be saving an innocent man's life." The appeal fell apart. Mohiuddin landed in Dhaka Central Jail at 2:16pm Monday after he was taken to Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at 1:40pm. bdnews24.com/cor
