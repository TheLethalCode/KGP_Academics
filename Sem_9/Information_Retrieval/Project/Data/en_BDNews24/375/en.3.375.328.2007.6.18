<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) -- A medical board has been set up to examine the deteriorating health of former BNP minister Mirza Abbas. Spokesperson for Dhaka's Apollo Hospital Giasuddin Ahmed said Abbas had been undergoing treatment since being admitted Friday evening with multiple organ failure. "A medical board was formed Sunday with Dr Shahabuddin as head of the five-member team," Ahmed said. "The experts have already suggested a few more diagnostic tests." Abbas has long experienced heart, liver and kidney ailments of varying severity as well as suffering diabetes, hypertension and cervical sodalities (stiff neck). Doctors will decide after the results of further diagnostic tests whether to perform a coronary (heart's blood vessel) or renal (kidney) angiogram. Joint forces arrested the former minister for housing and public works on Feb 25 with corruption links when he went to the Anticorruption Commission to turn in his wealth statement. bdn
