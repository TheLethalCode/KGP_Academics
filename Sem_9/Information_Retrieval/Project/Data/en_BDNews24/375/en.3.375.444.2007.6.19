 BAGHDAD, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military said it had launched a major offensive against al Qaeda north of Baghdad on Tuesday involving 10,000 soldiers, in one of the single biggest operations against the Sunni Islamist militant group in Iraq. The military said in a statement that 22 militants had been killed in the early hours of the offensive, called Operation Arrowhead Ripper. The operation was taking place around the city of Baquba in Diyala province, an al Qaeda in Iraq stronghold. Attack helicopters and ground forces had launched the offensive in an attempt to "eliminate" al Qaeda in Iraq militants operating in Baquba and its surrounding areas, the statement said. "The end state is to destroy the al Qaeda influences in this province and eliminate their threat against the people," said Brigadier-General Mick Bednarek, deputy commanding general, operations, 25th Infantry Division. "That is the number one, bottom-line, up-front, in-your-face, task and purpose," he said. The statement said approximately 10,000 soldiers, backed up by attack helicopters, close air support and various armored vehicles were taking part in Operation Arrowhead Ripper. It did not say how long the operation would last. The US military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, has called al Qaeda public enemy number one in Iraq. US officials say the group is trying to tip Iraq into full-scale sectarian civil war with a wave of car bomb attacks and other acts of violence.
