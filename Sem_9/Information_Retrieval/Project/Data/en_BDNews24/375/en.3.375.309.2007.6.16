<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com) - Thirty-five private firms will be in the bidding, which opens Sunday, to set up 10 small power plants in the country, a power ministry official said Saturday. The Power Cell, a body under the Power Division, has accepted 35 proposals out of 37 after technical evaluation. MA Jalil, director general of the Power Cell told bdnews24.com over telephone that they had completed technical evaluation on the proposals and would open bidding Sunday. The Power Cell would recommend that the government assign firms able to set up the plants at the lowest rates, Jalil added. The two firms not permitted in the bidding are Noorpore Power Limited for a 30- MW Maona project and the joint proposal of the Association of Dandy Group and ECBL for the 20 MW Tangail project. The private firms would set up 10 small power plants in three categories. Three plants of 10 MW capacity each will be set up in Ullapara, Mahipal and Habiganj, four of 20 MW each in Barabkunda, Feni, Tangail and Narsingdi and three others of 30 MW each in Janggalia, Rupganj and Maona. The interim government last month scrapped bidding in the SPP project on the grounds of corruption and irregularities and re-invited tender. The BNP-led government initiated the project in 2004 to solve the acute power crisis across the country. In the last three years, the project was redesigned six times, and bidding cancelled twice. bdnew
