 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The United Nations's annual World Day to Combat Desertification.will be observed Sunday as 'World Desertification Day'. The theme is ''desertification and climate changeone global challenge'' to focus the world's attention on dangers of desertification and its prevention. Of six billion humans, nearly a fifth are threatened directly or indirectly by desertification, experts warned ahead of the day. China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Central Asia, the Middle East, as well as a major part of Africa and swathes of Argentina, Brazil and Chile are in the front line of unacknowledged crisis. In Bangladesh, some non-governmental organisations are scheduled to observe the day, which has yet to get attention due to lack of proper government initiatives. Abu Sumon, director of Wetland and Costal Biodiversity Project under the Department of Environment, said this year global warming has been focused for its alarming impact. Terming desertification another side-effect of global warming, Sumon said, "Recently we have found some plants which grows in harsh environment naturally. We have taken it as an evidence of desertification in northern region of the country." He said Barindra land as the most hard soil in the country. "Another latest phenomenon directly related to the problem is decreasing underground water level." The United Nations has warned that global warming is helping to drive the onward march of parched land and, in years to come, millions of people could be driven from their homes. In April, the UN's top scientific authority on global warming warned that higher global temperatures could have brutal effects on rainfall patterns, runoff from snowmelt and river flows in scores of countries that already battle water stress. Between 80 and 200 million more people could be at risk of hunger by 2080, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated. Some 70 percent of Earth's 5.2 billion hectares (13 billion acres) of agricultural drylands "are already degraded and threatened by desertification," says the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which hosts Sunday's commemorative day. These vulnerable lands are progressively at risk of overgrazing, deforestation and other forms of exploitation, to which climate change is now a powerful addition. Desertification is increasing at an alarming rate, and although serious environmental and social consequences have been recognised for sometime, this issue has not received the level of national, regional and international attention that it deserves, the UN body said. bdn
