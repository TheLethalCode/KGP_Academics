<TITLE> Socialist power couple's split-up intrigues France </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defeated French presidential candidate Segolene Royal said on Monday her partner, Socialist party leader Francois Hollande, had moved out of their home after weeks of speculation over the couple's love life. The liaison between the two Socialists, who have four children but never married, has dominated headlines since Royal overtook her more experienced partner last year to become the party's presidential challenger. "We no longer live in the same home," Royal told France Inter radio, after the split-up was reported in a new book. "I have asked Francois Hollande to leave our home, to live his love life in his own way, which has been laid open in books and magazines, and I've told him that I want him to be happy," Royal was quoted as saying in the book "Segolene Royal -- Les coulisses d'une defaite" (Behind the scenes of a defeat). News of the split overshadowed the results of Sunday's parliamentary election, which the Socialists lost to the conservative allies of President Nicolas Sarkozy. "The break-up", Le Parisien daily said in a banner headline, mentioning the election results only in a small sub-heading. Commentators wondered what impact the power couple's separation would have on the party's leadership battle. Royal has made clear she wants the top party job, but Hollande has said he will not leave his post until the autumn of 2008. Hollande and Royal strike a sharp contrast. Short, round and bespectacled, Hollande has been a fervent speaker since his days as a student activist. Admirers praise his energy, which often leaves him red and bathed in sweat when he makes speeches, while critics call him "marshmallow" or "wild strawberry". "WILDLY ROMANTIC" Unlike her partner, Royal, was hardly known to most French people only three years ago. But she marked a spectacular ascent winning the party's presidential ticket, a prize that Hollande at one point clearly hoped would be his own. "I'm living a nightmare," Hollande was quoted as saying last year, intensifying speculation about their relationship. Although she lost to Sarkozy in a presidential election run-off last month, Royal secures a strong following among the Socialists by advocating an opening to the centre and by often outlining her differences to her party -- and its leader. Hollande said on Monday there was "no political cause" and "no political consequence" from the break-up. "I don't think I'll do anything against him," Royal told French radio. In the book, which is due out this week, the authors quoted her as saying: "We're on good terms. We speak. There's mutual respect." Only three months ago, Royal denied all rumours about a separation and even said she had considered marrying Hollande in French Polynesia in 2006. "It would have been wildly romantic, a marriage in pirogue (boats) and at the other end of the world!" she said. Last month, the couple said they were suing the publisher of another book which described strains in their relationship. There were just as many rumours during the presidential election campaign about the state of Sarkozy's marriage after his wife Cecilia vanished from the campaign trial. A newspaper said she did not even vote for her husband in the second round run-off, but she reappeared at his side immediately after his victory was announced and the couple have been seen together regularly since th
