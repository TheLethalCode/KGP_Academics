 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Bahrain Wednesday decided to sign three agreements coming into effect this year to boost trade ties. Both the governments agreed to sign deals on avoidance of double taxation, investment protection and a direct air route. After a meeting with Bahrain's state minister for foreign affairs Dr Nezar Sadiq Al Baharna at the state guesthouse Padma, foreign affairs adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said: "We have reached an understanding." "Some 75,000 Bangladeshis are now working in Bahrain. We hope to send more skilled and semi-skilled workers," Chowdhury said. He said the discussion focused on how to boost trade and investment. Baharna said: "We had very good discussions on investment. Bahrain is expecting to launch mutual ventures on food, garments, medication and flower industries." The labour market reform also came up for discussion, he said. Before his scheduled departure on June 22, the Bahrain minister will visit Square Pharmaceuticals at Savar EPZ, Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge and Grameen Bank and will have a meeting with Board of Investment officials. Biman Bangladesh Airlines suspended its flight operations to Bahrain in 2006, which slowed the exports of fresh vegetables. bdnews24.com/
