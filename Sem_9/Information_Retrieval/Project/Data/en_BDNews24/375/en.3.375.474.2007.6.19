 Mokarram Hossain Shuvo bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)The Secondary School Certificate examination is to see changes in question papers and mark distribution system from 2009. Marks for 'objective' or multiple choice questions (MCQs) will be reduced to 40 percent from 50 percent, and the marks for 'essay' type questions will increase to 60 percent from the current 50 percent. Faced with widespread criticism, the education ministry suspended the introduction of the linear educational system nationwide, opting for mark reallocation under the present examination system. This change in policy came in early June. The education ministry forwarded the new directive in a letter to all education boards, educational institutions and local education officers. bdnews24.com obtained a copy of the letter. The directive makes clear that the only change for the time being will be introduced in mark allocation. The change will be most evident in earmarking 60 percent marks for 'structured' or descriptive questions instead of the current practice of keeping 50 percent marks for short answers, explanations and essay type questions. In physics, chemistry, biology, elective mathematics, agriculture, home economics and computer science, there will now be an allocation of 40 percent for 'structured' questions. The general allocation for MCQs will become 40 percent instead of the current 50 percent. MCQs allocation for physics, chemistry, biology and elective mathematics will now be set at 35 percent. Computer science at 30 percent with 25 percent for agriculture and home economics. On an average, each MCQ will have a one-minute allocation for answering. The remaining time will be earmarked for answering the essay type questions. For subjects with a 60 percent mark allocation, six out of nine questions would have to be answered, while those with a 40 percent allocation now have to answer four out of an available six. Subjects unaffected by the changes are English paper I, English paper II, Bangla paper II, Easy Bangla, Bangla language and Culture, Vocational Education, Basic Trades, Arabic, Pali, Music, Physical Education and Sports, Bangla language and literature, English language and literature and Fine Arts and Crafts. Question setters would prepare MCQs in line with the educational board's format. Education secretary Mamtazul Islam was not available for comment. bdnews24.
