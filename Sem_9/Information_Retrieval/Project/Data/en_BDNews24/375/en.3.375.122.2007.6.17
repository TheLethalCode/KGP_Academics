 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Retired Lt General Mahbubur Rahman Sunday demanded the resignation of Khaleda Zia from BNP as chairperson. According to him, Khaleda Zia has lost any legitimacy to remain political chief of the party. The BNP standing committee member and former army chief spoke exclusively with bdnews24.com at his old DOHS home Sunday. Rahman referred to the fact that Indian Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi did not take up the post of prime minister. He said Khaleda Zia should follow her example by retiring willingly. He also claimed that there was no division within the BNP: "The leaders and workers want to cleanse the party through reform. However no-one can break the party. All members have respect for Shaheed Zia." "The present BNP has deviated from the ideals of Shaheed Zia. Zia never allowed corruption, nepotism or the establishment of any dynastic system. The information extracted by law enforcing agencies from arrested ministers, MPs and leaders, published in the media, is tarnishing BNP's image." Rahman also put forward some proposals for reform within the party. His proposals include reduction of power wielded by the party chief, provision for running the party under joint leadership, registering the party with the Election Commission, publication of an annual financial statement from the party, mandatory system for electing leaders from grassroots level through elections and cancellation of party membership for the corrupt. "In order to make decisions in these matters it has become imperative to amend the party constitution. Now that a question has arisen over the legality of the present leadership, the party chairperson should relinquish the post. "I hope the chairperson will realise the expectations of the party leaders and workers." Rahman, widely regarded in the BNP as being pro-reform, said: "A complete reform is necessary to remove the degradation and criminalisation that has eaten up politics." Citing the People's Republic of China as an example, Rahman continued: "Deng Xiao Ping's complete reform programme has resulted in the growth of China as a superpower. Reform is the greatest power China has." Praising the armed forces for cooperating with the caretaker government, the former army chief said: "Our armed forces were born during the liberation war. During all disasters the patriotic army has stood by the people. If there had been a one-sided election on Jan 22, the country would have plunged into a bloody civil war." "The country was saved by the decisions of the caretaker government and the active cooperation of the army." He supported the government's reform of institutions such as the Election Commission, the Anticorruption Commission and the Public Service Commission. Rahman said: "People's trust of the interim government and the army has increased manifold. The people hope the present government can succeed in curing politics." However the former BNP lawmaker added, "Politicians will rule the country. Reform is happening so that honest and efficient people can come to leadership. Their path has so far been blocked. If the political system is strengthened the country will benefit and democracy will be strengthened." During bdnews24.com's interview with the retired Lt General, he stressed that alongside BNP corruption, criminalization has also been eating away at Awami League. According to Rahman, "At present there is very little difference between these two parties. When in power both the parties amassed huge amounts of money. This plundering reminds one of the looting carried on by Col Clive of the East India Company." Rahman identified lack of good governance, autocracy, nepotism and corruption as the reasons for the fall of the last BNP government. He held Khaleda Zia responsible for this. On whether the BNP would be 'free of dirt' if the BNP chairperson steps aside, Rahman said: "Zia is the name of a revolutionary spirit. Begum Zia's contribution to BNP is also immense." "She came to the people through a popular movement. However, now she is controversial. In such a situation Begum Zia can step aside following the example of Sonia Gandhi." Regarding why his opinions were not made clear while in power, Rahman said, "I was not a member of the cabinet. As a lawmaker I have spoken against corruption in parliament, I inquired into allegations of corruption in the defence committee. We discussed the issue of the rise of militancy in the country in our committee several times." Rahman described Bangladesh as a country with huge potential saying, "We did not give the people any fruits from their hard-earned independence in the last 36 years. This is the failure of the politicians. However, we have many achievements too. We have a Nobel prize winner." b
