 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A missile attack killed at least 17 pro-Taliban militants and wounded 10 in a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border on Tuesday, according to independent television news channels. The blast occurred at a militant training camp near Datta Khel district, some 60 km (40 miles) west of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The Pakistani army did not carry out any operations in the area, army spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said, adding that initial reports suggested the explosion occurred while the militants were making a bomb. Pakistani military spokesmen have offered such explanations in the past when U.S. forces in Afghanistan have launched strikes on militant targets in Pakistani territory in order to avoid admitting any violation of territorial sovereignty. Aaj and Dawn television news channels both reported that the militants were killed in a missile attack.

Under the terms of the treaty, foreign fighters were bound to either surrender or be expelled, but critics said the pact created a sanctuary for militants in North Wazirist
