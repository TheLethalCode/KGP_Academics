 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) -- United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon has expressed his desire to visit Dhaka soon to express his solidarity with Bangladesh against climate change, the foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Ban expressed the desire when Ismat Jahan, the new ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the UN, presented her credentials at his office on June 18. Scientists say Bangladesh will hit be hard by climate change due to increasing global warming. This will take form in floods, salinity and droughts, all of which will drastically affect crop output and food security. A vast portion of country's southern belt will be submerged for one degree Celsius increase in world temperature, putting the lives of 55 million people in danger Ban praised Bangladesh's active role in UN peacekeeping missions. "He also appreciated Bangladesh's active role in the ongoing reform initiatives of the United Nations, including restructuring of the department of Peacekeeping Operations," the statement said. Jahan assured the UN secretary-general of Bangladesh's strong commitment to UN issues in areas of development, environment, good governance, human rights and humanitarian programmes. bd
