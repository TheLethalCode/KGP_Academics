 Chittagong, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Ready-to-export garments worth crores of takas went down the drain after Monday's torrential rains swept through a private container depot at Fauzdarhat in Chittagong, officials said. Several containers of readymade garments of more than 50 companies were at Port Link depot for export, the officials said. A top BGMEA official put the loss at Tk 100 crore. Goods in at least 80 containers at the lower rung were severely damaged as they went under three to four feet water. Garment businessmen said they were not allowed to enter the depot even four days after their goods were swamped. Port Link authorities also did not give them an estimate on the losses, they complained. Garment exporters' group BGMEA has faulted Port Link for the losses. Port Link Logistics Centre Limited (PLCL), however, blamed the damage on natural disaster. They posted adverts in newspapers terming the incident as an "act of God" and said they had nothing to do with it. Chittagong Customs authorities Saturday formed a four-member enquiry committee headed by assistant commissioner Kazi Fariduddin to assess the extent of damage and report in five days. The committee, composed of one representative each from the BGMEA and Port Link, is also tasked to find out how rainwater could damage hundreds of cartons of garments in the depot. Chittagong Customs commissioner Mohammed Fariduddin told bdnews24.com he along with BGMEA representatives had visited the depot in Fauzdarhat industrial area Saturday noon. He said an assessment of the losses is going on. Fariduddin said the probe committee would try to find out how much the 'natural disaster' is responsible for the damage and how much Port Link authorities are. The customs commissioner said the committee has been told to estimate the amount of losses based on each export consignment. BGMEA's first vice president MA Salam said no affected businessmen including himself was allowed in the container depot until the joint forces went there Thursday, four days into the incident. MA Salam said Port Link authorities failed to piece together an assessment of losses even 120 hours after the mishap. He said at least 30,000 of some two lakh cartons of readymade garments kept in the private depot for export were damaged,forcing the businesses to count no less than Tk 100 crore in lost money. The BGMEA vice president said foreign buyers would duck the loss and some 60 firms may the prospect of losing export orders and paying compensation. Goodwill of the local readymade garment exporters with the foreign buyers will also suffer a dent, Salam said. Ferdous Pervez, managing director of Omega Sweater and Bando Fashion Limited, said his firm sent 66,000 pieces of sweaters and 113,400 pieces of men's woven shirt to the depot on June 8. He put the value of the goods at nearly $600,000. "I still don't know how much loss I have suffered. Despite repeated requests Port Link authorities could not give a statement on the loss. They are telling me nothing," Pervez thundered. Syed Shamim, a BGMEA official, said he along with customs commissioner Fariduddin and Salam found Saturday wet and damaged readymade garments were still being recovered. Port Link in an advertisement in a local daily on June 13 said rainwaters entered the container depot on June 11 to cause huge damage to the goods of the consignees. A general diary was lodged with Sitakunda Police Station. The advertisement signed by PLCL general manager BS Gill said the damage was caused by natural disaster, which was an "Act of God". Gill could not be reached by phone. bdnews24.co
