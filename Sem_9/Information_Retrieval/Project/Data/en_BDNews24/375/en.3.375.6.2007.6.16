 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Importers of old vehicles Saturday asked the government to roll back a hike in duty the budget proposed on import of used microbuses since the fresh spike would double the prices in the retail market. The importers' association said at a press briefing the proposed 20 to 35 percent supplementary duty on all motor vehicles including microbus in the annual outlay for the 2007-08 fiscal would hit the buyers hard. Leaders of the Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association (Barvida) said the new duty would put brakes on the soaring demand in the local market for microbuses used for both private and commercial purposes. Barvida president Abdul Haque read out a statement at the news briefing that said microbus is also hugely used for carrying patients with owners of private clinics and hospitals using it for ambulance service thanks to its reasonable price. Haque said car dealers enjoy zero duty in importing ambulance but because of high prices of a new ambulance, the clinic owners usually avoid to buy new ambulances. He said the retail price of a microbus would increase by Tk 4 lakh to Tk 9 lakh because of the proposed duty. In 2006, around 3,000 reconditioned microbuses were registered with the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, according to an estimate of Barvida. A drop in sale will force the businessmen of used cars to stop importing microbuses, Haque warned. The statement said the used car sector is neglected because of discrepancy in fixing the age limit of old vehicles, inconsistency in the import policy and high registration fees. The association demanded withdrawal of the proposed duty to keep the prices within the reach of the middle class. It also asked for introduction of the pre-shipment inspection at ports, fixing age limit of the imported vehicles at 6 years instead of 4 years. Barvida general secretary Md Abdul Hamid Sharif, senior vice president Md Shah Selim Tipu, joint general secretary Helal Uddin Chowdhury and former president Anwar Hossain also attended the news briefing. bdnews24.
