 Chittagong, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Troops are carrying out vital responsibilities to salvage the country from a big crisis, army chief General Moeen U Ahmed said Wednesday. The army chief said his colleagues have widened their support to all vital state organs in the crusade against corruption since a state of emergency was imposed in mid-January. The army is an inseparable part of the national entity since it shares people's successes, failures and sorrows, Moeen said, as he witnessed the graduation parades of the 56th BMA Long Course and the 27th BMA Special Course at the Bangladesh Military Academy at Bhatiari. Now the forces are trying to help the government to prepare a context for a meaningful national election, the army chief said. Moeen asked the fresh graduates to uphold the hard-earned image, honour and tradition of the forces. "You are earning the honour when the country is passing through a critical juncture of the national history and when the activities of the defence are being rewarded with high accolades," Moeen said. The army chief also reminded the graduates of the forces' significant role during natural disasters. A total of 44 officers, including four women officers, were commissioned in the 56th BMA Long Course while 10 others got the degree in the 27th BMA Special Course. Battalion senior under officer Md Ashraful Alam earned the 'sword of honour', as he was judged as the all-round best cadet in the 56th BMA Long Course Company senior under officer Md Naziruddin won the Chief of Army Staff's gold medal for his brilliance in military courses at the BMA. Chittagong army division General Officer Commanding Maj Gen Sina Ibn Jamali, BMA commandant Brig Gen Sabbirul Karim, many other high military and civil officials, heads of diplomatic missions and guardians of the graduating cadets attended the graduation ceremony. bdnews24.
