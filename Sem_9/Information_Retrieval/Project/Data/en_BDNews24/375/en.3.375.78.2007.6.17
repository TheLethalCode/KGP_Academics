 Rajshahi, June 17 (bdnews24.com) -- A Rajshahi court Sunday framed charges against BNP leaders Barrister Aminul Haque, Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu and Nadim Mostafa and 27 others for backing militancy. Rajshahi additional sessions judge Abu Saleh Sheikh Md Zahirul Haque framed the charges in a case filed with Bagmara Police Station. Dulu, who served the BNP-led government as deputy minister for land, was taken to court, but former telecommunications minister Aminul Haque and former lawmaker Nadim Mostafa are still at large. Of the accused, Jalil Amin, Rahim Uddin, Hanif Mandal, Abul Hossain, Abdul Kalam, Nazrul Islam, Moksed Ali, Mostak, Murshid Sonar, Siddique Sonar, Matlur Rahman, Mozahar Mandal and Sajbul were arrested. Ayub Ali from Palashi village, who alleged torture by militants, filed the case on April 30 this year. Investigation officer Shakil Ahmed submitted a chargesheet in the case on May 23. According to case details, a group of militants on April 7, 2004 demanded Tk 1 lakh in extortion from him. They introduced them as loyalists to Aminul Haque, Dulu and Nadim Mostafa. On Ayub's denial to pay the money, the militants took him away from home to Hamirkutsa camp of Bangla Bhai and tortured him. Ayub was later freed as he agreed to pay the money. On April 11, he paid the militants Tk 80,000 at Hamirkutsa camp. bdnews2
