<TITLE> Azizul blames price hike on businessmen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday blamed businessmen for a price spiral of goods despite a cut in their import duty in the proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08. He asked the businessmen to find out reasons for the unethical business trend. "The government has to deploy Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) personnel to intervene in the market following the surge in prices of some essentials despite proposals to cut down the duty measures," Azizul told a post-budget discussion. Whenever the BDR intervenes, the markets acts like the way it should, he said. The prices of edible oil, lentil and pulse shot up despite the budget proposed a duty cut although those were expected to come down, he said. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) organised the discussion at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre with its president Mir Nasir Hossain in the chair. National Board of Revenue chairman Badiur Rahman also spoke. The businessmen told the adviser that said proposed duty hike on raw materials and capital machineries could derail the economy and asked him for a rethink. Mirza Azizul said it is a pro-tax and pro-liberalisation budget, which will help the country to move towards a higher growth path. "There are two eternal truthsdeath and tax," he said. "But tax collection in Bangladesh is very poor, one of the lowest in the world." The tax-GDP ratio in Bangladesh, where some 140 million people live, is only 10.4 percent in the outgoing fiscal year. On his proposal to reduce import duties in some cases, the adviser said, "Import duty rise sometimes hurts many consumers." He said the planned hike in duty on capital machinery to 10 percent from 5 percent would not affect the industry as life expectancy of a machine is at least 10 years, meaning the duty is 1 percent a year. "Duty incentives for indefinite period cannot make a country's industry viable. Sometimes it affects negatively." "Moreover, we're obliged to the World Trade Organisation in this regard," he added. He however said in today's world prices depend on the international market behaviour. The adviser said no budget could fulfil demands of all sections. "We will try to strike a balance in the budget before finalising it," he said. bd
