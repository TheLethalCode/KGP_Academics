<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Sixty-one Supreme Court lawyers Saturday said barring Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina to go abroad to see her expecting daughter was 'inhuman' and 'unfortunate.' In a joint statement, the lawyers asked the government to lift restrictions on Hasina's visit to the United States. They said the move equals violation of basic rights of a citizen. Barrister Shafique Ahmed, former attorney general KS Nabi, former Supreme Court Bar Association president Mahbubey Alam, Advocate Abdul Hamid and former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru were among the signatories. Hasina was scheduled to travel to the US Friday night to see her daughter Saima Wajed Putul but was confined inside her Sudha Sadan home cordoned by platoons of police. The AL chief faces three counts of charges of forcibly taking money from businessmen known to be loyal to her and party. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Thursday asked yd. police and the immigration to stop Hasina going abroad if necessary for the sake of investigation into the latest two cases as many businessmen filed Wednesday. The orders came after investigating officers from Gulshan and Tejgaon police stations appealed to the court seeking a ruling to stop Hasina leaving Bangladesh, saying that her absence might hamper investigations, already underway. bdnews
