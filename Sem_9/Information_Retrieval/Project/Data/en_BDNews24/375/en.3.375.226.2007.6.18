<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Poor-performing shares rallied most on the Dhaka Stock Exchange that finished almost flat Monday. According to trading data on the DSE, eight companies listed as 'Z category' or low-performing companies, gained 10 percent to 20 percent. But none of the 'quality' issues rose over 10 percent. The shares that recorded higher gains were Aziz Pipes (20.86 percent), Excelsior Shoe (14.75 percent), Samata Leather (13.53 percent), Legacy Footwear (12.5 percent), Rose Heaven Ball Pen (12.5 percent), Lexco (11.45 percent), Rahman Chemical (10.79 percent) and Ashraf Textile (10.22 percent). Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told bdnews24.com: "Rumours have increased the prices of some issues. I think there is no major distortion in the market. But we are looking into the progress of four issues." "We are watching and will take steps if we detect any manipulative motive," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of DSE. "Market behaviour was pretty good. Transactions were higher as well," he said. However, the DSI or all-share price index declined 8.02 points or 0.47 percent to 1677.93 due to a fall in the shares of Rupali Bank, IFIC Bank and UCBL. The initial 'profit-taking tendency' made the market fall in the first half of the day but later it recovered somewhat amid 'buy-pressure'. The DGEN or general index ended just 1.85 points or 0.09 percent up at 2047.21. The DSE-20 blue chip index added 5.50 points or 0.30 percent to 1816.09. Only the CSE-30 index gained. The CSE all-shares price index and CSE selective index slipped slightly. DSE turnover dipped to Tk 1.53 billion from Sunday's Tk 1.57 billion. On the CSE, it fell from Tk 237.90 million to Tk 220.93 million. Summit Power, the leader in turnover with Tk 141.40 million, moved up 2.85 percent to Tk 929 on rumours of increasing its power generation capacity. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, the second biggest issue by turnover value, fell 1.37 percent to Tk 593. Southeast Bank gained 0.83 percent to Tk 455. Profit-taking led BRAC Bank and Prime Bank to end lower. BRAC slipped 0.52 percent to Tk 717. Prime declined 0.62 percent to Tk 790. bdnew
