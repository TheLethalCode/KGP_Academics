 BANJA LUKA, Bosnia, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia and Bosnia's Serb Republic are close to sealing a big energy sector deal, the Serb Republic's Prime Minister said on Tuesday, hinting at more politically-motivated cooperation between the two nations. "We are negotiating (with the Serbian government) the building of the Buk Bijela hydro electric plant," Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told a group of foreign journalists on a visit to Banja Luka, the capital of the autonomous region. "The ministers are meeting and making plans and we expect to see the plans finalised in the next few months." The construction of the Buk Bijela plant on the Drina river is estimated to cost 200 million euros ($268.3 million). The plant would have an annual capacity of around 400 million kWh. The Serb Republic's state power company Elektroprivreda RS had initially planned to build a bigger plant with Serbia and neighbouring Montenegro, but Montenegro pulled out of the project due to environmental concerns. The Serb Republic, the Serb-dominated half of Bosnia that has been autonomous since the end of the 1992-95 war, has always been close to Serbia, which supported it with money and troops in its fight against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. The cooperation with Serbia on Buk Bijela would be the second big deal between them this year, after Serbia's state-owned Telekom Srbija bought into the Republic's Telekom Srpske. The Serbs paid 646 million euros for a 65 percent stake, a price Dodik at the time called a "dream offer", but analysts said was over the odds and politically motivated. Dodik said the Serb Republic was turning to Serbia for partnership because it was easier to develop economically through working with them, than through teaming up with Bosnia's other half, the Muslim-Croat federation. The two entities have been at odds politically since the 1995 Dayton peace deal ended the war, and economic ties between them are minimal. "People want to partner with the federation but it doesn't work," Dodik said, noting that the Serb Republic had trouble even selling its products in the other entity's market. "As a government we are currently trying to economically develop the Serb Republic, and bring additional political stability to it," Dodik add
