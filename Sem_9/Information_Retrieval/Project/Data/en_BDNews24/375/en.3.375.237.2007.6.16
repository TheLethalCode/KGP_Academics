<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank chief Saturday stressed appointment of skilled, modern management to the recently corporatised Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks. "Corporatisation would not bring any positive result if the management was not skilled in operating the banks," Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed said. The government recently corporatised three nationalised commercial banks Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks where the government will depute seven directors. "The board of directors must be informed, knowledgeable and pragmatic. I hope the government would appoint such people to the board of directors." He made the remark at a roundtable on "Corporatisation of NCBs" organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) at its office. He poured cold waters on the idea of running corproratised banks the way the government is run from the Bangladesh Secretariat. "It will be unfortunate if the government wants to run the NCBs with a pre-conceived or biased attitude." He however said compliance to Bangladesh Bank's statutory liquidity ratio would improve whatever the composition of the boards is. DCCI president Hossain Khaled chaired the roundtable addressed also by Faruk Ahmed Siddiqi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Syed NaserBukhtear, chief executive officer of Agrani Bank, presented the keynote paper. The registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms last month approved the three banks to start operations as limited companies. The central bank also gave them the thumbs up the same month to operate as public limited companies. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have long pushed for privatisation of all four state-owned banks. Corporatisation is the initial step toward privatisation of these banks. Another NCB, Rupali Bank Limited, has already been privatised. The governor said corporatisation of the NCBs has poses both opportunities and challenges. The NCBs have been brought onto the highway from the country roads, which he thinks is a great opportunity for them to give better service. "Efficiency, transparency and accountability will increase if the management practices accounting system of international standards," Ahmed said. He said reduction of non-performing loans (NPL) is one of the major challenges they face. "NPLs push the lending rate up in Bangladesh," the governor said. "We're discussing with the bankers about how to reduce the NPLs." Other big challenges the banks face are ensuring compliance and internal control and improving the services, he pointed out. In today's world, risk management is very import factor for a bank, which he said NCBs could do it in a better way now that they have been corporatised. These banks have to go for initial public offerings to raise capital. "Anyhow the government has to appoint experts to the board of directors to carry out the tasks," he said citing the example of Pakistan where its government has tapped an expert as its deputy governor in the central bank with a whopping paycheque. The other speakers said it would be easier for the corporatised banks to offload their shares through the stock exchanges. bd
