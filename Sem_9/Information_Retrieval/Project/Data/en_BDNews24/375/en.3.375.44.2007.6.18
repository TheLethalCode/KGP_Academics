<TITLE> Czechs offer Poland climbdown ladder in EU talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LUXEMBOURG, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Czech Republic offered Poland an opportunity to climb down in talks on a new European Union treaty on Monday but it was unclear whether Warsaw was interested in a face-saving compromise. Poland is demanding changes to a reformed voting system agreed in 2004 which it says would give big states, especially Germany, too much power mainly at Warsaw's expense. A Polish veto would block progress on a charter for reforming institutions for the enlarged EU. Only the Czechs have lent Poland half-hearted support, while the other 25 EU members insist the voting reform must stay. As EU foreign ministers discussed preparations for a crucial summit on Thursday and Friday, Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra said Prague wanted to help find a compromise between Poland and Germany, which holds the EU presidency. "As a country in Central Europe, we see Poland as a very important country. We definitely don't want to see Poland isolated," Vondra said. Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said after meeting central European colleagues in Bratislava he hoped Poland would not have to use its veto, but he insisted it would defend demands for re-weighting the EU voting system. "I hope we will not have to use the last resort, a veto. I hope we will be able to find a compromise," Kaczynski told a news conference in the Slovak capital. But the mere mention of veto made clear a clash is a real possibility. German government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said that while differences had narrowed on many points, "it's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve". LONG, HOT SUMMIT German Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to win over Polish President Lech Kaczynski, the prime minister's twin brother, in lengthy weekend talks, and ministers forecast a long, combative summit in Brussels later this week. Vondra said he had cleared his schedule for Saturday and expected the summit to run into a third day. Wilhelm advised reporters to pack a third shirt. Polish Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga told reporters the so-called double majority voting system enshrined in the constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 was unacceptable. Under the reform, most decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population. Poland, which has less than half Germany's population, has proposed an alternative based on the square root of each country's population. The Polish delegation circulated a paper touting its alternative as an "Equal Influence System" and arguing that under the reformed voting system, the 14 poorest EU states would be unable to block any unwanted legislation. Merkel stood firm on the voting rights question on a brief visit to Luxembourg on Sunday and refused to shelve the issue. Britain and the Netherlands have set out other demands -- the former insisting a Charter of Fundamental Rights must not be legally binding on it, the latter seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back draft EU legislation. Diplomats say both requests are legally tricky, as are British demands to limit the scope of EU foreign policy, but none was seen as a show-stopper, unlike the Polish problem. Agreement at the summit could lift the enlarged EU out of two years of torpor and give it a fresh start. But another failure could plunge it deeper into gloom and institutional gridlock, possibly prompting a vanguard of countries to try to press ahead with closer integration. France, which voted against the constitution, and Spain, which approved it in a referendum, joined forces in a memorandum appealing for support for a quick simplified treaty. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who inherits the EU chair from Germany on July 1, told reporters in Bratislava: "Unless Europe takes a decision, it will pay a pric
