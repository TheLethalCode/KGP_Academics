 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh open their five-week tour of Sri Lanka Wednesday with a three-day warm-up match against Sri Lanka A at the Colombo Colts ground. The team management has decided to rest vice-captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique and opener Mehrab Hossain Junior for the match, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of Bangladesh Cricket Board. The Tigers had a tough three-hour nets Tuesday before a swimming session on the pool of Hotel Taj Samudra where the team is staying. The first of the three Tests gets underway at the Sinhalese Sports Club on June 25. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene told reporters Monday at the hotel where he went to welcome the Bangladesh squad that they would not take Bangladesh lightly, according to cricinfo.com. "Bangladesh has made a lot of strides forward from the time they were last here. The more exposure you get in international cricket the more the players mature. "We know how good Bangladesh are. We knew how good they were in the World Cup. "They were in our group and we knew how dangerous they could be. We had to play a really good game to beat them in Trinidad," Jayawardene said. Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful was confident that his side would put up a better performance in the Test series than they did in their last tour when the Tigers were routed 2-0 in the Tests and 3-0 in one-dayers. "We have been practising hard and every day we are improving. In one-day cricket we have improved a lot but in Test cricket we have some way to go. "Our intention is to improve our Test cricket. We will play hard on this tour to achieve that," Ashraful was quoted as saying. Bangladesh 12 for warm-up match: Mohammad Ashraful (capt), Shahriar Nafees Ahmed, Javed Omer Belim, Habibul Bashar, Shakib Al Hasan, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Sharif, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain Rajib, Syed Rasel.
