<TEXT>
 NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Author Salman Rushdie said on Monday he was "thrilled and humbled" to be awarded a British knighthood but he had no comment on anger in Iran and Pakistan where his book "The Satanic Verses" outraged many Muslims. The British author, who was born in India, was awarded the knighthood for services to literature in Queen Elizabeth's birthday honours list published on Saturday.

In Pakistan, students affiliated with a religious party protested in two towns while Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said the decision to honour Rushdie was insensitive to Muslims. "We deplore the decision of the British government to knight him. This, we feel, is insensitive and we would convey our sentiments to the British government," Aslam told a regular briefing. "Salman Rushdie has tried to insult and malign Muslims through his writings and this had provoked very strong reaction and sentiments in the Muslim world." Earlier, Pakistan's parliament adopted a resolution condemning the knighthood and said Britain should withdraw
