 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)- Police Tuesday again obstructed visitors to Sudha Sadan, the Dhanmondi home of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. None other than close relatives of Hasina are being allowed to enter Sudha Sadan since 2pm. Police on duty at the house said they are acting on verbal instructions from higher authorities. Awami League leaders Subid Ali Bhuiyan and advocate Rahmat Ali were prevented from entering Sudha Sadan Tuesday. At about 8pm, former deputy leader of the opposition in parliament advocate Abdul Hamid, former minister Motia Chowdhury, former lawmaker Faruq Khan, Atiur Rahman Atiq and Segufta Yasmin Emily were seen waiting for entry. When the party leaders wanted to know why they were being prohibited entry to the house, patrol inspector Mohammad Rajib told them: "We don't have permission to let anybody other than close relatives of the AL president in." He said, "Higher authorities have given us a verbal order in this regard. We have not received a written order. I have nothing much to say." Motia and Segufta had earlier asked the police whether Hasina was under house arrest. When they then tried to enter Hasina's house policewomen obstructed them. At the time Motia and Faruq Khan spoke with Hasina by phone, appraising her of the situation. Motia told reporters: "The government has created a smoke screen regarding reform. This measure has been taken so that district or grassroots level leaders and workers cannot meet with Sheikh Hasina." Abdul Hamid said, "I am a lawyer. I have to go to the leader for advice on cases. But today I have not been allowed to do so." Asked whether Hasina is under house arrest he said, "If she was under house arrest her relatives would not be allowed in. But even accused persons in jail are given the right to meet with lawyers." bdnews24.com/s
