 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court has fixed Monday to decide on framing charges against former law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed in a duty-dodge case under the Special Powers Rules. Moudud's counsel Khandaker Mahbub Hossain Sunday appealed to the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Tribunal, seeking Moudud's acquittal from the case. In the appeal, the lawyer said: "The case was designed to harass Moudud Ahmed." The alcoholic beverages Moudud is accused of possessing were not seized from him, the lawyer said. "The beverages were recovered from his palatial house. He knew nothing about the existence of the recovered items. He did not import, nor did he have control over it," the lawyer said. "He should be acquitted from the case." But public prosecutor opposing the appeal told court: "Moudud Ahmed was aware of the beverages as they were recovered from his bedroom and kitchen. "As he is guilty, it should not be acquitted of the charges." Judge Md Azizul Haque issued the order after the former minister was brought before court at 11.50am. Joint forces arrested Moudud on April 13. Different goods including "relief saris" were seized from his house. The goods included 220 pieces of relief saris, alcoholic beverages, documents of different agreements and bank cheques. Gulshan police sub-inspector Kabir Ahmed filed a case against Moudud for bringing in beer and other foreign alcoholic beverages without paying duty. bdnew
