<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  An official team will visit Myanmar next month to explore scope for power import, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday. The delegation will also discuss with the neighboring country's officials investment in agriculture, the adviser told reporters after a meeting with Myanmar's ambassador to Dhaka, Nien Lin. The power secretary will lead the team. The move is important since Bangladesh is suffering from a huge power shortage while Myanmar is rich in hydropower. "I went to Myanmar last April. Many issues came up during that visit. Next month's visit will be a follow-up," Iftekhar said. He said Myanmar, which is ruled by the military-junta, has already increased imports of Bangladeshi pharmaceuticals. Lin, meanwhile, said his country was eager to strengthen political and economic bonding with Bangladesh. The foreign adviser's recent visit to Myanmar was very important in making a solid ground for a stronger relation, he said. bdnews24.com/
