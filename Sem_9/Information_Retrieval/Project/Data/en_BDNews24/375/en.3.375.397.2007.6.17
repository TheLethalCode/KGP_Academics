<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  About 15 Supreme Court lawyers Sunday met Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina and told her that they were ready to fight a legal battle for her. Former Supreme Court Bar Association president Mahbubey Alam told reporters: "We have told her (Hasina) that we will go to court to seek a redress on her behalf if she wants." The lawyers stayed with Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home for nearly two hours and came out at about 7.15pm. Alam said the lawyers expressed solidarity with the Awami League president and discussed legal issues surrounding the cases filed against her and travel restrictions on her. He said Hasina termed the cases false and quoted her as saying the cases were designed to stop her going abroad. The lawyers who went to Sudha Sadan included AL law affairs secretary Sahara Khatun, office secretary advocate Abdul Mannan Khan, Supreme Court Bar Association former general secretary Enayetur Rahim, former lawmaker advocate Rahmat Ali and advocate Nurul Islam Sujan. Asked when they would go to court, Enayetur Rahim said: "We cannot say right now exactly when." bdnews
