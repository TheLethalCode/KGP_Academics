 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The trial of a sedition case against eight JMB members started Tuesday with the taking of witness statements. Dhaka additional district judge Golam Murshed heard the witnesses. The accused in the case that was filed on Sept 11, 2005 are: Rafiqul Islam Sentu, Md Wahab, Md Yeakub Ali, Md Faruk Hossain, Nurul Islam, Anwar Hossain, Md Wahiduzzaman Pintu and Md Abdus Salam. Of the eight accused, Rafiqul Islam Sentu is now in custody while the others have been evading arrest. According to case details, Dhamrai police sub-inspector Ruhul Amin while on duty with back-up forces on the Dhaka-Aricha highway on the night of February 21, 2005 saw a group of people near the Joypura junction. As they tried to flee after noticing the presence of police, the police chased six of them down. Two managed to escape. Police recovered masks, broken pieces of glass and diaries containing code names of chemical and inflammable materials from the six. On interrogation they said they were members of Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh. They were sent to court after arrest, but five received bail and have absconded since then. Under a directive from the home ministry, sub-inspector Md Jehad Hossain later filed cases against the eight persons involved in the Feb 21, 2005 incident with specific allegations of sedition. A sedition charge was brought against them on January 28 this year accusing them of inciting hatred against the government through the undermining of law and order by exploding bombs in different areas of the country. bdnews
