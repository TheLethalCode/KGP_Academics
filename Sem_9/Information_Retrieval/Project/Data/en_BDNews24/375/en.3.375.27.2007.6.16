 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com) - Over 150 political leaders and activists from different parties Saturday gathered at a city hotel apparently to discuss a new political party. They, however, said that they had got together for lunch hosted by Dhaka city Awami League organising secretary Syed Khokon. After the lunch, JP leader Rawshan Ershad told bdnews24.com "We've joined hands on a mission. We must be successful. "It wasn't a meeting. We, the like-minded people who want to join a new process, got together, JP chief HM Ershad's wife said. When asked about the gathering, Syed Khokon, son of former Dhaka city mayor and Awami League leader late Mohammad Hanif, echoed Rawshan. "I'm going to join a new party. Ferdous Ahmed Quoreshi is its coordinator. I'll tell you everything once the ban on indoor politics is withdrawn," Khokon added.
