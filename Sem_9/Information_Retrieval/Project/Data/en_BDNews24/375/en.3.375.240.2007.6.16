 GAZA, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas prepared to swear in a new government in the West Bank on Saturday that will bring an end to a US-led aid embargo as hundreds of his Fatah loyalists fled Gaza by land and sea. Abbas sacked the Hamas-led government after Islamist forces routed Fatah in the Gaza Strip and began imposing a new order in the enclave after days of bloody civil war. A senior Palestinian official said US Consul-General Jacob Walles informed Abbas that Washington would lift a ban on direct aid to the new emergency government, clearing the way for the European Union and Israel to follow suit. Gaza and the West Bank are only about 45 km (30 miles) apart, with Israel in between, but they now appear poised to function as two separate territories -- a Fatah-controlled West Bank and a Hamas-controlled Gaza. "Gaza, unfortunately at this stage, is out of the control of the Palestinian Authority," Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said. Hamas said it did not intend to set up a Gaza state. Western powers imposed an aid embargo after Hamas came to power in March 2006 because it failed to recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept interim peace deals. Palestinian officials said hundreds of Fatah supporters were allowed by Israel and Egypt to exit Gaza and then travel to the occupied West Bank. About 50 Fatah gunmen and 200 other demonstrators stormed a Palestinian parliament building in Ramallah in the West Bank to protest against Hamas's bloody takeover of Gaza. No injuries were reported. The militants grabbed the deputy speaker, who is aligned with Hamas, and dragged him from the building, witnesses said. He was not hurt. In the West Bank city of Hebron, al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militants, an offshoot of Fatah, stormed government offices and set up checkpoints to search for Hamas members. Many Fatah supporters who live in Gaza fear reprisals from Hamas militants. In one refugee camp near the Gaza coast, Fatah loyalists lamented Hamas's takeover. "We were destroyed... I feel lost," said Umm Rami, whose husband is a colonel in the Fatah-dominated National Security Forces. Arab governments said they would support Abbas and called for a return to the situation before the Islamist movement's bloody takeover of the coastal strip. HANIYEH PLEDGE Ismail Haniyeh, who became prime minister after Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary election, has refused to accept his dismissal. In an interview with a French newspaper, he ruled out setting up a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip separate from the West Bank. "Separation is not on the agenda and never will be," Haniyeh said. Abbas has tapped Salam Fayyad, a Western-backed independent lawmaker, to serve as prime minister of the emergency government in what Hamas said amounted to a coup. The government will be sworn in on Saturday or Sunday and will comprise 11 lawmakers, Abbas aides said. Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi said Fayyad's cabinet faced daunting challenges, chief among them being "to ensure the rule of law and to prevent the spread of lawlessness from Gaza to the West Bank". The security challenge was highlighted in orders issued by Palestinian police chief Kamal el-Sheikh, who is based in the West Bank, to his men in Hamas-controlled Gaza. He ordered the police, who have long been dominated by Fatah, neither to report to work nor to follow Hamas's orders. Under Palestinian law, Abbas can declare a state of emergency for up to 30 days. The state of emergency could be extended for another 30 days, but only after winning the approval of two thirds of parliament. Hamas has a majority in the parliament although Israel's arrests of nearly half of Hamas's deputies put that majority in doubt and also made it hard to achieve a quorum. That could enable Abbas to keep the state of emergency in place longer.
