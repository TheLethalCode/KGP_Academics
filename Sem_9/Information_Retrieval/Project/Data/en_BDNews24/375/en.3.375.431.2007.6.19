 Kathmandu, June 18 (bdnews24.com/PTI) Nepal's Maoists today strongly rejected Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's offer to make King Gyanendra's six-year-old grandson the ceremonial King of the country and said such a proposal could jeopardise the coalition government. Koirala yesterday said he has urged King Gynendra and Crown Prince Paras to abdicate in favour of Paras' son Prince Hridayendra before the constituent assembly elections and warned that otherwise there may not be any space for monarchy. Maoist leader Prachanda said Koirala's proposal could jeopardise the coalition government in Nepal and would only "weaken" the interim constitution. "The remarks made by the prime minister are against the spirit of the Interim Constitution," Prachanda alleged. "Such statements could weaken the unity of the eight parties and we strongly oppose his proposal," he told reporters. Talking to reporters at his residence here, Koirala said he had told the King, who was stripped off most of his powers after a popular uprising last year, that their stepping down could help save the institutional monarchy in Nepal. Prachanda said Koirala's statement showed that the prime minister and his party are still in favour of the monarchy "This shows that the prime minister and his party are still in favour of the monarchy," said the Maoist chief, who led a decade-long revolt against the throne before signing up for peace last November. Koirala's critics said the move was meant to save the monarchy. Elections are expected to be held in November to choose a body to rewrite the country's constitution and decide the fate of the monarchy.
