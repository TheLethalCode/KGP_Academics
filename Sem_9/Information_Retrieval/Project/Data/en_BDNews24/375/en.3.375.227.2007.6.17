<TITLE> Diana fascinating for her contradictions: biographer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALTHORP, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After penning biographies of Lucrezia Borgia and Jacqueline Kennedy, historian Sarah Bradford was reluctant to write about Princess Diana because she thought of her as a 'silly, neurotic blonde'. By the time Bradford finished her book, she had changed her mind. At a literary festival staged at Diana's family home in Althorp, Bradford told Reuters the princess made such a fascinating subject because of her contradictions.

"I discovered that before she died she was planning to do specific television programs focusing on issues like landmines, AIDS and, strangely enough, illiteracy. "She was going to do media training in New York. She had mapped out a way of continuing her charity work in a very conspicuous way." And for Bradford, it was poignant appearing at a literary festival just a stone's throw from the island where Diana is buried on the Spencer family estate. "I must say it is really uncanny for me to be here talking about he
