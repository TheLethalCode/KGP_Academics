 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday deferred the hearing of charge-framing against Barrister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda in a graft case to Thursday. Lawyers for the accused referred to Sigma Huda's poor health and appealed to Dhaka metropolitan senior judge Azizul Haque for more time before proceeding with pressing corruption charges. The court granted an extension of two days. The former communications minister was taken to the court at 11am Monday, but Sigma Huda was not in the dock. The court granted an appeal of Huda's lawyers for more time to submit documents related to an arms case. The court set the lawyers a June 26 deadline to submit the documents.
