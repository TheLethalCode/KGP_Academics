 WASHINGTON(bdnews24.com/AFP)- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that Washington was concerned about the political crisis in Pakistan and underlined the need for "free and fair" elections. "Well, of course, we've been concerned about the situation in Pakistan. And any time there is violence, we're concerned about it," she told reporters ahead of talks with her Pakistani counterpart Khurshid Kasuri at her office. She was asked about the violence and US interests in the region amid the political turmoil faced by President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US "war on terror." The crisis, the biggest since Musharraf seized power in a bloodless military coup in 1999, was triggered by his suspension of Pakistan's chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry on March 9, which has led to widespread protests. Days after the suspension, pro- and anti-Musharraf supporters clashed, leaving more than 40 people dead. Opposition figures say Musharraf ousted Chaudhry to make it easier to be re-elected this year as president-in-uniform, despite the constitution saying he should give up his dual role by end 2007. US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and his assistant Richard Boucher met Musharraf last week at his army office. "We have a very intensive engagement with the Pakistani officials at this important time," Rice acknowledged. Boucher had said earlier that the United States expected that elections should be "free, fair and transparent" and conform to international standards. But he indicated there was no pressure on Musharraf to hang up his uniform. Rice also highlighted the need for free elections. "There are important set of events coming up when there will be elections in Pakistan and the importance of those elections being free and fair as a foundation for a more democratic Pakistan, I think, is very clear and I will discuss that as well with Foreign Minister Kasuri," she said. Rice however hastened to add that Musharraf had implemented "important" reforms in Pakistan. "I think we have to recognize that Pakistan has come a very long way since 2001 in its commitment to try and root out extremism, to try to make reforms, educational reforms, reforms on concerns of women and the like," she said. But Washington, she said, would continue to prod for more reforms. "We have been second to none in continuing to press for openness in Pakistan, for the rights of opposition in Pakistan, and for free and fair elections when they are held," she said. Kasuri, when asked in an interview with American broadcasting network CNN whether Musharraf would shed his uniform if reelected, said, "What the president has said, on many occasions, is that he will abide by the constitution." The minister cited media freedom, especially in broadcasting, as among reforms pushed for by Musharraf. "When he took over, there was only one channel, the Pakistan Television, PTV. That's it. Now there are so many that I can't count. And our media is very independent," he said. "It's independent in the sense that there are no holy cows, unlike some countries  even in America  that say on security, on foreign policy the American media is relatively soft." Kasuri, a member of the Pakistani National Command Authority, also dismissed fears that Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal could fall into the hands of Islamist terrorists if Musharraf was ousted, saying there were "strong institutions" in place to secure the arms. "But whatever may happen, one thing is absolutely clear: Pakistan's nuclear weapons are in very safe hands," he said. "And we are consulting with all our friends. We are following all the latest procedures for safe-guarding our weapons," he sa
