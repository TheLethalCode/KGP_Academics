<TEXT>
 DURHAM, England, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ryan Sidebottom claimed two of the four West Indies wickets to fall before tea in an extended first session of the fourth and final test against England at Durham's Chester-le-Street on Saturday. West Indies were 92 for four at the interval with the always reliable Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 37 and Dwayne Bravo on 14. Sidebottom had two for 30 from 10 overs. It was the perfect start for England, who are seeking to win the series 3-0 after previous victories at Headingley and Old Trafford. After the first day and three hours of day two were lost to rain, West Indies captain Daren Ganga was out to the first ball of the match when his forward push to left-arm swinger Sidebottom was caught at short leg by Alastair Cook. Chris Gayle scored a four in the seventh over after a poor fielding attempt by Monty Panesar -- his second error in three overs. Next ball, bowler Sidebottom was handed the ultimate punishment when Gayle clipped a six off his legs over midwicket. LOOSE SHOT Gayle's aggressive intent, though, was his downfall when a loose shot to Matthew Hoggard in the eighth over saw him trapped lbw on the back foot to an in-swinger. Left-hander Gayle made 28 from 24 deliveries and struck three boundaries and one six. He has failed to make a half-century so far in seven innings in the series. Just when West Indies required consolidation, left-hander Devon Smith was bowled out for only four runs when he misjudged a Sidebottom delivery and left a ball he thought would swing away but actually went straight on. England almost reduced West Indies to 43 for four but Ian Bell at third slip could not hold a sharp chance at head height offered by Chanderpaul off Hoggard when he was on nine. Runako Morton was the fourth man out, driving Steve Harmison's slower ball to Sidebottom at mid-off for six. Bravo worked hard to ensure he survived until tea and spent 25 minutes and 20 balls at the crease before scoring his first run. Chanderpaul scored 116 not out in the previous test
