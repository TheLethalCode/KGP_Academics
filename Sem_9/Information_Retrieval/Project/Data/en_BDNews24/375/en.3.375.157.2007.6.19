<TITLE> No taskforce will probe Hasina cases: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser MA Matin Tuesday said that no taskforce would investigate extortion cases against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "These are not corruption cases, rather they are extortion cases. No taskforce will be assigned to probe the cases," the chairman of the national coordination committee on checking serious crimes told reporters at the communications ministry. On whether the government was forcing reforms on political parties, Matin said: "It's not a matter of coercion. I don't know if the government has any intention to impose it." Matin faced a barrage of questions on travel restrictions on the Awami League chief who was not allowed to go to the US to see her relatives. The adviser was also pressed to comment on the rumoured flight of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid out of the country, despite an extortion case against him. Matin ruled out the charges of double standards and said: "Law is equal to all." bdnews
