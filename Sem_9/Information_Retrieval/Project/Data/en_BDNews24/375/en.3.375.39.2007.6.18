 DURHAM, England, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England gave themselves an outside chance of winning the final Test as West Indies ended day four on 83-3, still 30 runs behind at the Riverside. Paul Collingwood's 128, the first Test century by a Durham player on home turf, was instrumental in England's recovery from 165-6 early in the day. Collingwood and Matt Prior (62) put on 169 to give England a total of 400. And two Matthew Hoggard wickets, plus one from Monty Panesar kept the hosts on top going into the final day. Under grey skies, the ball swung and seamed consistently for the bowlers in the morning, before the sun came out in the afternoon. Andrew Strauss, having worked so hard on Sunday, was a little unlucky to fall to the first really good ball of the day. After such a miserable winter and early summer for him, the Middlesex left-hander had added just five to his overnight 72 when Fidel Edwards slanted a ball across him. A thin edge was gladly pocketed by wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin, giving Fidel Edwards his fourth wicket of the innings and leaving England on 133-5. Collingwood initially looked edgy in his first Test innings at his home ground. Ian Bell, on the other hand, looked more composed, and played a lovely drive down the ground for his only boundary. But attempting a repeat, off Daren Powell, he was deceived by late swing and edged to Runako Morton, lurking in a position between the slip cordon and gully. That wicket left England six wickets down and still 122 runs behind - and so a West Indies victory at that stage looked a distinct possibility. Collingwood and Prior got England through to lunch without further damage before the hosts completely dominated the middle session. By now, Collingwood was playing well, despite passing fifty with an edge past a vacant second slip and surviving a good lbw appeal by Powell on 59. He accelerated smoothly from that point, gifted some easy runs by Marlon Samuels' innocuous off-spinners. Samuels was also hit for six by Prior as the Sussex man passed fifty, and the second new ball prompted a flurry of fast scoring, including another Prior six, clobbered over deep mid-wicket as the right-hander charged Corey Collymore. Collingwood then hit three pull shots for four in a single Edwards over, the middle hit giving him his century which was rapturously received by the supporters. Finally, Prior holed out at deep square-leg to give Edwards - easily the best West Indies bowler - his fifth wicket of the innings. Tea was taken with England 341-7, suddenly well ahead, before Collingwood and Harmison both fell with the score on 369. An unlikely 31 runs were added by Panesar and Ryan Sidebottom, who clouted five boundaries in his 26 not out. It meant West Indies began their second innings 113 runs behind and a re-jig of the top order did not help them a jot. Out-of-form skipper Daren Ganga dropped down to number three, but had to enter the fray in the second over with Devon Smith - promoted upwards - palpably lbw to Hoggard. Ganga then completed his sixth single-figure score of the series when edging a drive off Hoggard to Prior. And the third blow to West Indies morale came when Runako Morton chopped a Panesar delivery onto his own stumps. Chris Gayle, showing his best footwork of the series, ended the day on 52 not out with Shiv Chanderpaul on 16
