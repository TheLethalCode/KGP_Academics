 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Four members of Bangladesh Public Service Commission resigned offices Sunday. The four went to the Bangabhaban at 1pm and turned in the resignation letters to President Iajuddin Ahmed. One of them, Anwarul Haque, told bdnews24.com: "I have resigned. I went to the Bangabhaban to resign my post." Prof AKM Shahadat Hossain Mondal, Latifur Rahman and Prof Fazlul Haque also went to the presidential palace to resign from the PSC, Anwarul Haque said. Asked about the cause of resignation he said: "There is no reason. I have just resigned. I didn't mention any reason in my resignation letter either." Another PSC member, Ashraful Islam Chowdhury, chairman of the 27th BCS exam committee, resigned on Thursday. Prof Ashraf joined his previous teaching job at the marketing department of Dhaka University. His resignation came after the 27th BCS oral exam was cancelled on May 30 amid broader allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism surrounding the exams. Prof Ashraf told bdnews24.com that he had just wanted to quit with dignity. Prof Ashraf was appointed to the PSC on May 30, 2004. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams in a move meant to restore trust of people in the Public Service Commission and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports questioning the transparency of BCS exams. The sixth member of the commission, Prof Mahfuzur Rahman, has been evading arrest as he appears on the corruption watchdog's list of graft suspects. bdnews
