<TITLE> Trust in government around the world eroding: Ayub Quadri </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Education adviser Ayub Quadri Sunday said people were losing confidence in the ability of government around the world, which is one of the challenges of good governance. People are also losing access to employment opportunities and services, which the adviser said was another area of concern. "My frustration is with the relentless deterioration of governance and the destruction of all vital public institutions," Quadri said in his address to the launch of a national consultation workshop on the Seventh Global Forum, organised by United Nations Development Programme, at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "The only way to give people some relief was to somehow make the government irrelevant in their day-to-day affairs," he said. The workshop has been designed to bring government officials, business leaders, civil society representatives and other stakeholders together ahead of the Seventh Global Forum to be held in Vienna on June 26-29. A delegation will attend the meeting to present recommendations in what is known as Bangladesh Country Paper. UN resident coordinator and UNDP resident representative in Bangladesh Renata Lok Dessallien, who attended the workshop, said people's trust in services such as police, health and education was not high at all. The theme of the Seventh Global Forum is building trust in government. The creation of the forum was to find ways to ensure economic development through efficient governments across the globe. bdn
