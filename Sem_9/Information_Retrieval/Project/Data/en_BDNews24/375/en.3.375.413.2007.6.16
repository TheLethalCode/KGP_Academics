<TITLE> Market behaved as it always has </TITLE>

 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Many are frustrated prices of some essential commodities have not fallen despite tariff cuts on them in the budget although prices of commodities whose tariffs have been raised immediately shot up. Predictably, such an asymmetric adjustment of the market to budget changes has been attributed to business greed, hoarding or syndication. Interestingly, the apex body of businesspeople, the FBCCI, has called such behaviour unethical, implying that honest businesspeople should not behave in this fashion. The fact of the matter is that the market has behaved in exactly the way textbooks say it does. The response of business, notwithstanding what FBCCI or others might say, was entirely predictable. The budget has proposed a reduction in the tariffs of some essential items such as edible oil and lentils, and raised the effective tariffs on some other items such as sugar. If they are not revised these tariffs will come into force at the end of this month after the budget is approved. Imported commodities that enter the country afterwards will be subjected to the adjusted tariffs. Businesspeople are currently stockpiling these commodities built up from past imports that were levied duties at the current rates. Those who are stockpiling commodities whose import duties have gone down will have to sell at a loss if they adjust the price downward immediately. No business will ever do so if they can avoid it. They would know that no new consignments could come to the market at the lower duty until a few weeks later. Until that time they do not face any competitive pressure to lower prices, and of course they will not. If they are also the importers, they would probably delay the import or release of new consignments to ensure that the current stocks are sold at the existing, higher prices. Only when imports at reduced duties enter the market next month will there be a downward adjustment in prices. Businesses holding stocks of commodities whose import duties have been increased are in the opposite situation. They know it for certain that the prices will be adjusted upward once the new duties come into force. Depending on what the possible increases are, maybe it is profitable for them to hold back supply in the hope of selling at a higher price when the new duties come into force. The very act of holding back sales will reduce the market supply of these items. Excessive purchases by consumers could also increase the market demand. An excess demand situation is thus created, which pushes up the current price. The markets will reach equilibrium only when the current market prices have risen toward the expected future prices. If the markets function efficiently this adjustment would be completed fairly quickly. That the market prices have risen to the new import duty inclusive prices seems to suggest that the major market players are fairly efficient operators. A rise in current prices in the expectation that prices will rise in the near future is not peculiar to Bangladesh; indeed it is a rather common phenomenon in the international markets. When there was an imminent threat of a war in the Middle-East, Iraq to be precise, oil prices went up despite the fact that current market situation had not changed. If a poor harvest of coffee (or any other crop) is expected due to inclement weather in major coffee-producing areas, speculative behaviour of traders ensure that international prices of coffee rise long before supply actually declines. The behaviour of the market prices since the announcement of the budget conforms to the principles of the competitive market. Consequently, allegations of syndication or unethical behaviour would appear to arise from a misunderstanding of the nature of the market. If anyone thinks market was meant to be just and fair, he is obviously seriously misinformed. The current market instability is an inevitable consequence of the budget process itself. I wrote a paper after the last budget (Daily Star, 29 June 2006) to hammer home the fact that the budget has some destabilising influences on the economy, which arise from the discretionary power of the Ministry of Finance to change the basic parameters of the economy such as taxes and tariffs. As long as the ministry can arbitrarily change these parameters the market will respond in the manner as it has after every budget.
