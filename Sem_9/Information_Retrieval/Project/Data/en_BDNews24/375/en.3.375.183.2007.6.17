 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Tigers left Dhaka Saturday night for Sri Lanka. In the five weeks long tour they are scheduled to play a three-match Test series and as many one-day matches. The Tigers are expected to reach the emerald islands on Sunday morning. "Though we couldn't play well against Sri Lanka in the past, this time we will like to see a good team effort against them instead of showing individual performances," said new captain Mohammad Ashraful at the Zia International Airport during their departure. Bangladesh's away record against Sri Lanka is not very good as the previous two full series saw humiliating four innings defeats and a huge 288-run loss in five Tests. The Tigers are also hopeful of shaking off the poor Test efforts and take all the three Test matches into the fifth day. Bangladesh will unwrap their tour with a three-day match from June 20-22 in Colombo before the first Test starting on June 25. The second Test and the third and final Test will be staged on July 3 and June 11 respectively while the three ODIs are billed for July 20, 22 and 24. "As I am now free from the pressure of captaincy, I will try to enjoy the Test matches and put up my best effort as a senior member of the team," said Habibul Bashar, who is 116 runs short of touching 3000 Test runs. After the Test series, five players  Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Tushar Imran, Farhad Reza and fresher Mahmudullah Riad will join the Tigers to play the one-day series. Test squad: Mohammad Ashraful, (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Shahriar Nafees, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Saqib Al Hasan, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Mohammad Sharif, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Rafique and Syed Rassel.
