<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)-Former army major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, convicted as one of the killers of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has decided to appeal against his death sentence. Mohiuddin expressed his intention to Dhaka Central Jail authorities Monday night, said deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui Tuesday. Mohiuddin was extradited to Dhaka from Los Angeles on a Thai Airways flight Monday. Police arrested him at Zia International Airport and took him to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Major Siddiqui has explained that a convict can appeal through the jail authorities, according to the jail code, within seven days of being brought to jail. "In the event of such an appeal, the senior jail super is to send the appeal papers to the Supreme Court," he said. Siddiqui said the appeal signed by Mohiuddin would be sent to the Supreme Court in a day or two. Meanwhile Mohiuddin is said to be suffering from severe jet lag. "As a result he has been sleeping most of the time," the DIG of prisons said Tuesday. He ate the foods supplied by the jail authorities three times a day. "Mohiuddin ate roti for breakfast and rice and vegetables for lunch Tuesday. He will be served with rice, fish and daal for dinner," the major said. On Mohiuddin's personal safety in jail, Siddiqui said a guard has been posted round the clock in front of his cell. Since his arrival security at the block has been tightened. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family were killed in 1975. The trial of the killers began after Rahman's daughter Sheikh Hasina assumed power. Twelve people, including Mohiuddin, were sentenced to death. Immediately after the murders, Mohiuddin along with other army officers involved in the incident fled to Thailand. Since then he has been employed to Bangladesh missions in Algeria, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. He travelled to the US in 1996 to meet his son and remained there until a US court ruled his stay illegal. bdnews24.com/
