 DURHAM, ENGLAND, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England won the Test series against West Indies 3-0 as a confident final day performance at the Riverside gave them victory by seven wickets. Monty Panesar finished with 5-46 as West Indies were bowled out for 222, leaving England needing 110 to win. Shivnarine Chanderpaul's valiant 70 - he was the last man out - was in vain. England lost wickets either side of tea to be 29-2 but Michael Vaughan hit an unbeaten 48 to get England home with more than 30 overs remaining. Chanderpaul, who missed the Headingley match with injury, ended the series with 466 runs at a phenomenal average of 148.66. The gritty left-hander had also batted for five minutes short of 18 hours since his dismissal in the first innings at Old Trafford. Chanderpaul's achievements left the contest for man of the series a straight fight between him and Panesar, who took 23 wickets in the four Tests. Play began half an hour late on Monday because of drizzle and low cloud. Though it was too cold for the ball to swing in the early stages, Matthew Hoggard took an important wicket just 20 minutes into the day. The Yorkshire seamer slanted a ball across Chris Gayle and the left-hander, who had yet to add to his overnight 52, provided a lazy edge to give wicket-keeper Matt Prior an easy catch. West Indies then desperately required Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo to at least match their efforts of the first innings, when they put on 86. England attacked - at one stage, Hoggard had five slips and a gully in place in a bid to remove Bravo. But the Trinidadian right-hander drove solidly through the on-side for four before Steve Harmison was brought on in a bid to end the partnership. The local star, on the day it was revealed he would require hernia surgery at some point this year, produced his best bowling of the series. First Bravo took a ball on the shoulder of the bat which dropped inches short of first slip, then Chanderpaul, on 32, looked very fortunate to survive an lbw shout from Harmison. West Indies scraped their way to 131-4 at lunch, a lead of 18, but the good work was undone in the middle session. Bravo had begun to experience some joy hooking Harmison, and Chanderpaul was sweeping Panesar for singles at will. But then, playing one attacking shot too many, Bravo (43) skied an attempted lofted drive off Panesar to mid-off where Ryan Sidebottom took the catch. The wicket ended a partnership of 68 that had soaked up 20 overs and it was all downhill from there for the tourists. Two delightful Panesar deliveries from round the wicket - drifting in, pitching on middle and spinning away from the right-handers - were too good for Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin. Samuels gloved to slip and Ramdin was bowled off-stump. Then Harmison had Daren Powell playing a ridiculous attempted pull straight up in the air - he had been dismissed in identical circumstances in the first innings. The next wicket gave the north-east faithful exactly what they wanted to see when Harmison splattered Fidel Edwards' stumps with a fast, straight delivery. Finally Corey Collymore (16 not out) provided some support, but by now Chanderpaul felt forced to play more adventurously and paid the penalty when Panesar bowled him. England began their run chase before tea, and the new ball did plenty for Powell and Edwards. Andrew Strauss looked particularly uneasy. Dropped in the slips on three and 12, he was finally bowled through the gate by Powell. That wicket left England on 29-2, Alastair Cook having already departed to a slip catch. Vaughan did not take the mini-setback as a cue for caution, however, and hit some thumping pulls and drives to keep the pressure on the tourists. Kevin Pietersen (28) took him to within five runs of the winning line before edging Gayle to slip. And the winning hit was supplied when first innings centurion Paul Collingwood cut Gayle to the point fence for four
