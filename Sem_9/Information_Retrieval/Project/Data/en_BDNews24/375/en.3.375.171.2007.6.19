 HONG KONG, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong's wealth gap has increased markedly over the past decade under Chinese rule, making the affluent city one of the most inequitable places in Asia, according to new government statistics released on Monday. Hong Kong's Gini coefficient -- a widely used measure of income disparity -- increased to 0.533 in 2006 from 0.525 in 2001, the last available figure. It showed that Hong Kong's working poor were getting poorer or had not broadly benefited from the city's overall economic recovery.

Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang said recently that the city's economy was in its best shape in 20 years, but he admitted in a recent interview with Hong Kong's Cable Television that income disparity was a growing concern. "My attitude toward the wealth gap, especially with regard to poverty, is something that we definitely have to work hard on, to improve it," Tsang told Cable TV. According to a study by Oxfam and Hong Kong's Chinese University, the number of 'working poor', or those living on less than HK$5,000 ($640) per month, half of Hong Kong's median household income, had risen to around 350,000 -- 5 percent of the population -- in 20
