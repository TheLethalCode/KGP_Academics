<TITLE> Kasuri hints Musharraf to quit army post </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri strongly suggested on Monday that President Pervez Musharraf would give up his post as army chief by year's end as political opponents have demanded and the nuclear-armed country's constitution requires. Musharraf, a general who took power in a 1999 coup and who also holds the title of army chief, is facing growing turmoil and opposition to his rule since his March 9 decision to suspend the country's chief justice. He has been viewed as reluctant to give up his army post by the end of the year as required by the constitution, a move that would signal the country's return to civilian rule. Musharraf "has said he will not violate the constitution," Kasuri told Reuters in an interview. "The constitution allows him to wear it (his army uniform) until the end of the year ... I cannot put words in his mouth but he has said, not one, but 1,000 times, that he will abide by the constitution." Pressed on whether Americans should conclude from his remarks that the president will definitely vacate his army post, Kasuri said: "I will repeat what I said. President Musharraf has said umpteen times that he will abide by the constitution so I think you have a response there." Controversially, Musharraf aims to be re-elected, probably while still army chief, by legislative assemblies before they are dissolved in November for a general election around the turn of the year. Analysts believe Musharraf's attempt to oust the chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, is motivated by fear Chaudhry would allow constitutional challenges to his re-election plans. Widespread allegations of rigging accompanied the last elections in 2002. Kasuri arrived in Washington for an intensive round of 40 meetings over three days -- including talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- as political turmoil continued to roil Pakistan. Kasuri played down his trip as routine consultations between key allies. But it follows immediately after trips to Islamabad last week and over the weekend by three key US officials -- Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher and Adm. William Fallon, chief of the US Central Command. Many critics have accused the administration of sticking too closely to Musharraf because he has been a key ally in the war against radical Islamists, and of failing to aggressively push for Pakistan's return to civilian democracy. But Rice, before meeting with Kasuri, told reporters: "We have been second to none in continuing to press for openness in Pakistan, for the rights of opposition in Pakistan and for free and fair elections." She praised Musharraf as a "good ally in the war on terror" and as making important reforms related to education and women. In the interview, Kasuri rejected suggestions the political protests were a serious challenge for Musharraf, citing as proof the fact that Pakistan's stock market last week set a record, a sign of confidence in the economy. Kasuri declined to say if Musharraf erred in suspending the chief justice but stressed that Musharraf has vowed to "abide by the judgement of the supreme court" which is investigating the case. Pakistan's elections will be "free and fair" and observed by international monitors, Kasuri said. The minister said he could not confirm US charges that Iran is arming Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan because he doesn't know details and doesn't want to say anything that could affect Pakistan's neighbourly relationship with Tehran. Cross-border incursions by the Taliban militants have long been a bone of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both US alli
