 ISLAMABAD, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/BBC) -- Pakistan's parliament has condemned the award of a British knighthood to author Salman Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic Verses" outraged many Muslims around the world, and said Britain should withdraw the honour. Rushdie was awarded a knighthood for services to literature in Queen Elizabeth's birthday honours list published on Saturday. Iran accused Britain on Sunday of insulting Islamic values by knighting Rushdie. Pakistan's lower house of parliament adopted a resolution condemning the award. "This is a source of hurt for Muslims and will encourage people to commit blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad," Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Sher Afgan Khan Niazi told parliament. "We demand Britain desist from such actions and withdraw the title of knighthood," he said. Rushdie's book prompted protests, some violent, by Muslims in many countries. The late Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa death warrant against Rushdie in 1989, forcing him into hiding for nine years. Farhana Khalid Binori, a Pakistani woman member of parliament from a conservative religious party, said Rushdie's knighthood was an insult. "It is a slap on the face of Muslims. It is not acceptable at all," she said. British's twice-yearly honours ritual -- designed to recognise outstanding achievement -- is part of an ancient and complex honours system. A total of 946 honours were handed out in the birthday list, including 21 knighthoods. Rushdie, 59, was one of almost 950 people to appear on the Queen's Birthday Honours list, which is aimed at recognising outstanding achievement. The controversial Indian-born author's fourth book - The Satanic Verses in 1988 - describes a cosmic battle between good and evil and combines fantasy, philosophy and farce. It was immediately condemned by the Islamic world because of its perceived blasphemous depiction of the prophet Muhammad. It was banned in many countries with large Muslim communities and in 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, issued a fatwa. In 1998, the Iranian government said it would no longer support the fatwa, but some groups have said it is irrevocable. The following year, Rushdie returned to public life. Of his knighthood for services to literature, Rushdie said: "I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour, and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way."
