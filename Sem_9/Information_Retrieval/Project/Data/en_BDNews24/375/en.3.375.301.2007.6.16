<TEXT>
 Barisal, June 16 (bdnews24.com) Fishermen in the south are netting large numbers of hilsha fish from the confluence of coastal rivers. But, since deep-sea fishing of hilsha has been interrupted due to inclement weather, the huge catches are failing to have any impact on the market prices. Wholesalers say there is no possibility of the price of hilsha falling before the fishermen take to sea again. "Huge numbers of hilsha fish are being caught in the confluence of the Meghna for the last three to four days," said Rafique Saadi, a fish trader from Tajamuddin in Bhola district. Abdul Gaffar Talukder, chairman of Hijla-Gaurabdi union in Barisal, said each big fishing boat was catching 20 to 25 maunds of hilsha every day from the confluence of the Meghna. More catches are expected due to the influence of the new moon on Sunday when the hilsha will further congregate in coastal rivers. Fishermen also reported netting great numbers of fish in the rivers of Golachipa upazila, Patuakhali. Monirul Islam, boat owner from Char Montaz, the major fish landing station of Golachipa, claimed he has netted more than 1,000 hilsha in the last five days. Fish wholesaler Manik Miah of Golachipa sadar told bdnews24.com the price in the market has slightly dropped due to the catching of hilsha. "A one kilogramme hilsha was selling at Tk 500 to 600 just a week ago but now it sells at Tk 400," he said. He said as the netting of jatka (hilsha fry) was less last winter due to strict monitoring by the interim administration there was a possibility of more fish being netted this year. Several hundred fishing trawlers remained anchored at the ports, bdnews24.com was informed. On a visit to Barisal Saturday morning, fishermen and workers at the wholesale fish markets were waiting fot the weather to improve for them to go to sea. bdnews24.com/c
