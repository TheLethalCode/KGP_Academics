<TITLE> Britain to feel heat over Saudi arms deal </TITLE>

 PARIS, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain, immersed in controversy over a Saudi arms sale investigation it aborted, faced the prospect of renewed pressure in Paris this week at talks on an international anti-bribery convention. Britain is at loggerheads with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) since London abruptly terminated a two-year corruption inquiry into a $12 billion sale of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia last December. Officials from signatory countries to the convention -- which outlaws bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions -- meet behind closed doors on Thursday for a regular review of operations. The meeting provides an opportunity for them to quiz each other on what is working and what is not, the head of the convention's supervisory committee Mark Pieth, said. Pieth said the meeting was not dedicated to any one case but would allow envoys to engage in frank exchanges. The OECD, in charge of ensuring adherence, voiced concerns about Britain in March and would send a team to the country for "on-site" discussions between now and March 2008, Pieth said. "We will continuously monitor," he said, adding the main issue was whether there were systemic hurdles to investigations and prosecutions. Privately, other officials say the OECD wants to allow low-profile pressure to apply, after raising a red flag in March, much to London's irritation. South Africa became the first African country to sign up to the OECD's anti-bribery convention on Tuesday, vowing to do all it could to combat the "scourge" of corruption. "We take our obligations very seriously," said South African public prosecutor Vusi Pikoli. Britain's Guardian newspaper and the BBC said this month more than one billion pounds (two billion dollars) of secret payments had been made to Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan in connection with the contract for BAE Systems . Prince Bandar denies those allegations and BAE has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the al-Yamamah jet deal. The British authorities say national security interests prevent them from commenting in depth on why the inquiry by Britain's Serious Fraud Office was halted on government orders. Transparency International, a non-governmental organisation which lobbies against bribery, said in a statement last week London risked undermining the anti-corruption convention. "It is crucial for the future of the OECD anti-corruption convention that the facts concerning UK government contracts with the government of Saudi Arabia, and BAE Systems' involvement, be publicly revealed," said Cobus de Swardt, managing director of Transparency International. Swiss prosecutors have opened an investigation into the contract, Jeanette Balmer, spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office in Berne, sa
