<TITLE> India's Dravid hopes team will overcome absence of coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, India, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's lack of a coach for the tour of England and the one-day matches in Ireland and Scotland leaves a void that is difficult to fill, captain Rahul Dravid said on Saturday. "A captain cannot give individual personalised attention to all 15 of the team. Coaches can do that, if it means spending extra hours in the net, throwing extra balls or putting extra balls in the bowling machine," Dravid told a news conference in Bangalore. "It is about preparing a team well before and after (a match), in terms of looking at the overall picture, sometimes giving an outside view, taking some of the pressure off you in off-field activities, which seem to be increasing all the time nowadays." India have been without a coach since April after Australian Greg Chappell resigned following the team's shock first-round exit from the World Cup. South African Graham Ford turned down the offer to succeed him earlier this month. Former captain Chandu Borde, 72, has been named interim cricket manager, a role that former all-rounder Ravi Shastri performed during the recent tour of Bangladesh. "A coach or a cricket manager, whatever terminology you want to use, can make a difference in the preparation of the team," Dravid said. "I am sure this (interim arrangement) is a short-term measure and I am sure they will find someone who will do the role." India leave for Ireland early on Wednesday to play a three-match one-day series against South Africa and one match against the hosts. They then play Pakistan in a charity one-dayer in Glasgow before travelling to England in July for three tests and seven one-dayers
