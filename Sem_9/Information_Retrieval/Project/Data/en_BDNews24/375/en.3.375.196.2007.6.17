 KABUL, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb blew up a police bus in the middle of the Afghan capital on Sunday and a senior police official said more than 35 people were killed. Police described the attack as a suicide strike but an Interior Ministry official said this was still uncertain. The bus wreckage was drenched in blood and several other vehicles were destroyed. The bomb exploded during peak-hour traffic. The Taliban, ousted from power in 2001 by U.S.-led forces, claimed responsibility for the blast which would be the most deadly suicide attack in Kabul, if the death toll is confirmed. Afghan police featured heavily among the casualties, Ali Shah Paktiawal, chief of the Kabul police's criminal branch, said by phone from the scene outside a provincial government building. It was the fifth suicide attack in Afghanistan in three days. "More than 35 are killed," Paktiawal said. "Police officers are among the dead." The Taliban have claimed responsibility for all the latest series of suicide bombs, a tactic designed to dispel the notion foreign and Afghan forces are in control of the country. Since Friday, there have been attacks in the south, centre and north of the country, including a blast in Kabul on Saturday. "The operation was 100 percent successful as we hit our target and that was police," the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press quoted a Taliban spokesman as saying.
