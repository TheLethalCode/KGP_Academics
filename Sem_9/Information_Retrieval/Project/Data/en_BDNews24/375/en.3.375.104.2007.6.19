 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Singapore, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  Nokia is deploying Wi-Fi "hotspots" in 50 different locations of Bangladesh for affordable public access to the internet. "It will be our joint initiative with the internet connectivity providers," Nokia's Emerging Asia general manager Prem Chand told bdnews24.com in an interview. But he declined to reveal any details as the project is at nascent stage. Once implemented, it will be the first investment on ICT infrastructure by a mobile phone manufacturer in Bangladesh. Prem Chand's comment coincided with Nokia launching N800 device that is known as "Internet Tablet" for the Asian market during its annual event in Singapore Monday. This is the only gadget the world's largest mobile-phone maker produces that is not at all a mobile phone in the first place. Yet this rectangular shaped unique handheld internet browsing gadget earned popularity among the Euro-American executives after launching in Jan 2007. With an estimated price tag of 500 Singapore dollars or Tk 22,400, the N800 Internet Tablet will hit island state's retail electronics shops next month. "This is yet to be a product for the mass market," Prem Chand said. Web browsing, emailing, RSS feed reading, internet calling with video, instant messaging and media player are the key applications of N800. Its high-resolution (800x480) touch screen with up to 65,536 colours makes N800 attractive among the top tier executives. Instead of cellular mobile network, the N800 uses Wi-Fi wireless technology to access the internet. "That's why the Wi-Fi network coverage at home and workplace is essential to reap the benefits of N800." Nokia has also expanded its portfolio of affordable and stylish mobile phones for the mid-range market with the introduction of the Nokia 6267, Nokia 3500 classic and Nokia 6121 classic. They are expected to begin shipping in the third quarter 2007. The colourful Nokia 6267 includes an enhanced music player and dedicated keys to make listening to music uncomplicated. It is fitted with the new high speed video capability and two cameras, including a 2 megapixel camera with flash and 8X digital zoom. The sleek and compact fold phone also offers a large keypad and high resolution screen, calendar, organizer, and support for up to 4GB of expandable memory to store movie clips, images and music. It has up to 6.5 hours of talk time and up to 12.5 days of standby time. The anticipated retail price of the Nokia 6267 is 240 euros or Tk.22,160, before taxes and subsidies. Nokia 3500 classic will be available as a collection of vibrant colours with eye-catching keymat split line colouring. The Nokia 3500 classic comes with an FM radio, 2 megapixel camera, instant messaging and space for 2,000 phone contacts. It offers up to 3 hours of talk time and up to 12 days of standby time. The anticipated retail price of the Nokia 3500 classic is 135 euros or Tk12,465 before taxes and subsidies. The Nokia 6121 classic works in four different frequencies. With a 2-megapixel camera and 4X-digital zoom, flash and panorama mode, taking high-quality photos is fast and easy. Additionally, the Nokia 6121 classic also features a second camera in the front that adds a personal touch to calls by making use of the video call feature. Its anticipated retail price is 260 euros or Tk 24,000 before taxes and subsidies. bdn
