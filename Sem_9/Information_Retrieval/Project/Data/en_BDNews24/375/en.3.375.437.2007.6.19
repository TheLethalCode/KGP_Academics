<TITLE> Hasina against leaders over 60 at the helm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) -- No leaders over the age of 60 will be allowed to remain a member of the Awami League presidium or central working committee. After a meeting with AL chief Sheikh Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home Tuesday, her special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud told reporters: "All leaders over 60 will be accommodated in the advisory council." He said the party president was weighing a proposal to keep all leaders from the party chief to presidium members out of the cabinet if the AL formed government. The aide said the party president would start discussions after the ban on indoor politics is lifted. Dr Mahmud said: "Sheikh Hasina is regarded as the heart and soul of the party by leaders and workers." "So nobody thinks of reform excluding her. In fact reformists think that no reform is possible without Sheikh Hasina." The Awami League also thanked the US government for the deportation of Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. "Mohiuddin could not get asylum in Canada thanks to the role played by expatriates." bdnews24.com
