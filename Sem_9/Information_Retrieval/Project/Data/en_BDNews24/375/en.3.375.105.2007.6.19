<TEXT>
 DURHAM, England, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England batsman Paul Collingwood said on Monday he would like to succeed Michael Vaughan as one-day captain after scoring a century on the fourth day of the fourth test against West Indies. A statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board after the close of play said Vaughan had stepped down as one-day captain although he was still available for selection. Collingwood, 31, cracked 128 on his home ground in Durham and helped rescue England from 133 for five to 400 all out. West Indies were reeling on 83 for three at the close. He is a key member of the one-day squad with his middle-order batting, medium-pace bowling and brilliant fielding. "The news came as a bit of a shock but Michael obviously feels it's time to step down and give somebody else the time and experience for the next World Cup," Collingwood told reporters. "Obviously we have had some disappointing results in the World Cup and generally our one-day form hasn't been great and whether that put too much on his shoulders I don't know. "If I was asked I think it would be very hard to turn down. (But) there will be a few people who will be up for the job." Collingwood said world champions Australia had proved in the past, through Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting, that separate captains for the test and one-day sides could work. Meantime, Collingwood, who said his previous captaincy experience extended to Durham under-13s and the occasional first class match was delighted to score his fifth test hundred at home. "I know it's an overused term but it was a dream come true," he said. "It was a very special day and I had a good feeling about it for some reason. "I had the family here and a lot of friends so to get three figures and to help England into a strong position was very, very special.
