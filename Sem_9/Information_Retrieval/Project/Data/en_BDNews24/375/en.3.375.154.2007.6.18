<TITLE> EC set to stop 'nomination business' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain Sunday said the main election office had designed new rules to stop any "business" tied to candidate nominations for the polls. The local committee of every political party, Hossain said, has to provide a list of candidates for its central committee to nominate one for elections. In line with the new rules which are yet to be final, the provision will work as a condition for the party's registration with the Election Commission, he said. "At a proper time, political parties will be consulted and the rules will be finalised through a notice," Hossain said. On another clause in the drafted law, the commissioner said: "Party leaderships from top down will have to be determined by secret-ballot." "We believe EC's initiative will help reform the political parties," Hossain said. bdnews24
