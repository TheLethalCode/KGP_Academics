<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) - The housing and public works ministry is eager to take control of government flats, currently by former lawmakers, from the Parliament Secretariat, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Monday. The lawmakers of the eighth parliament will be stripped of the allotment of the flats, popularly known as Nam flats, the adviser told reporters after meeting speaker Jamiruddin Sircar. The flats will be rented to government officials until the next elections are held, the adviser said. "Currently there's no parliament in the country. Former lawmakers have no way to stay in those flats at a nominal cost. The public works department will re-fix the rent of the flats," Mainul said. There are 324 such apartments in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Nakhalpara and Banani. The former lawmakers live in the furnished apartments paying only Tk 600 per month in service charges. Mainul said the speaker was positive about the proposal. The adviser said the government had built the flats and allocated them to the MPs of the eighth parliament. Some flats are still vacant. The speaker on May 23 told bdnews24.com the lawmakers of the eighth parliament living at the buildings would not have to move out but have to pay the utility bills. "I won't tell the former MPs to leave the flats as they have the legal right to live in their apartments. They will be living at the buildings until formation of the next parliament," Jamiruddin had told bdnews24.com. He had made the remark after an official of the Chief Adviser's Office reportedly told the parliament secretariat to tell the residents of the buildings to leave since they were no longer lawmakers. bdne
