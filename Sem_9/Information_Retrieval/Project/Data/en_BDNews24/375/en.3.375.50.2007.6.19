<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Senior Awami League leader Motia Chowdhury Monday slammed law adviser Mainul Hosein for his statement that Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin could appeal the court verdict. Mohiuddin, sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the 1975 assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was deported by the United States Monday to Bangladesh. The former army officer landed in Dhaka Central Jail at 2:16pm Monday, as he was flown back home after a tense effort to seek asylum in the US or Canada fell apart. "He (Mainul) can't defend the killers," Motia told reporters in the evening after seeing party chief Sheikh Hasina at her Dhanmondi home, Sudha Sadan. Mainul Monday said Mohiuddin could appeal against his death sentence if the Appellate Division accepts it. "Mohiuddin is a convict. He will stay in jail. If the Appellate Division accepts, he can appeal like other accused," Mainul told reporters in his law ministry office. Motia said the entire nation wants the Bangabandhu killers, who are still at large, be brought back home soon. She thanked Bangladeshis, living in the United States, and the US judiciary that rejects Mohiuddin's appeal for asylum. bdnew
