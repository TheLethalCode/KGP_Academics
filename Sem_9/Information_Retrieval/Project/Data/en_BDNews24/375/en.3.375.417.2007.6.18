<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangabandhu assassination convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed landed in Dhaka Central Jail at 2:16pm Monday after he was taken to Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court for Dhaka at 1:40pm. Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui received him at the jail. A Thai Airways flight flew Mohiuddin in to Zia International Airport at 12:15pm. Khandakar Rafiqul Islam, a deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told bdnews24.com at 12:54pm that the immigration police arrested him on arrival at the ZIA. The decision on deportation came after Mohiuddin lost his appeal to the US Federal Court Thursday not to deport him to Bangladesh, acting foreign secretary Towhid Hossain was quoted as saying by BBC Radio Friday. Some foreign ministry officials preferring anonymity had said Mohiuddin would be escorted straight to jail from airport. Earlier, the family of the former army major convicted of killing independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made emotional appeals for asylum in Canada after the US decided to deport him. Mohiuddin entered the United States on a tourist visa in July 1996 and stayed on illegally. He was declared a fugitive after he was tried in absence and convicted in 1998 for his part in the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. Mohiuddin is one of the many former soldiers, dubbed "killer majors", who was at large after being given safe passage. Some of them were given diplomatic assignments and now live outside Bangladesh. Arrival at ZIA A horde of media waited at the VIP gate on the western end of the main airport building and the other at the main departure gate at ZIA trying to figure out which gate the convicted murderer would come out of. As the Thai Airways flight TG-321 landed at 12:15pm, the word was out that Mohiuddin, now 60, along with his escorts, two security officers from the United States immigration authorities, had finally arrived. The security men, whose names were not disclosed for security reasons, returned to the US on the return Thai Airways flight at 1:15pm. Security at the main departure gate was heightened as authorities decided to use it to take Mohiuddin out. At least five tiers of security cordoned off the entire departure keeping onlookers far away from the main departure lounge on the ground floor. Reporters, however, were allowed inside the permanent barricade at the departure lounge. Hasan Imam from Uttara was there. "I really do not understand why do authorities have to arrange for such huge security measures for a killer? Commoners like me wanted to have an innocent look at him but the police would not let us stay even near the departure barricade." Sarwar Jahan, a taxi driver, said, "I wish I could see Mohiuddin. I heard so much about this man who assassinated our leader and would have liked to see how brave he looks." A further away, more than 150 journalists scrambled for space to get a good view of Mohiuuddin being escorted to the departure gate. Some TV channels were interviewing incoming passengers, only to be stopped by a senior RAB official. Shortly, the security men gathered near the gate signalling where Mohiuddin was being led to. TV crew and photojournalists rushed to take a quick shot at him but only a few succeeded. Many could not recognise him in dark blue bullet-proof jacket with a helmet and a glass visor that almost covered his face. "I could not identify who Mohiuudin was," said a cameraman of a private TV channel. "Where was he?" asked another. RAB, police, Armed Forces Battalion and Special Branch policemen led him away to the van at 12:56pm in just 30 seconds. The prison van surrounded by about half a dozen police and RAB vehicles waited for instructions to leave. Precisely at 1pm, the van moved with loud sirens filling the air. There went the man who for two decades following Sheikh Mujib's assassination represented Bangladesh in many diplomatic missions. In July 1996, the month he arrived in the United States, Mohiuddin was ordered to return to Bangladesh to face criminal charges for his role in the military putsch. He appealed for permission to remain in the country permanently, which the Ninth Circuit Court in a ruling last month denied. bdnews24.com/
