 AGRI, Turkey, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan called on the United States and Iraq to deal with Turkish Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq, but said Ankara would take military action itself if necessary. Turkey's government is under mounting pressure from the public and army to tackle rebels based in mountainous northern Iraq who seek to establish a Kurdish state in southeast Turkey. Dozens of civilians and soldiers have been killed in recent weeks in Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) attacks across Turkey. "First our neighbour Iraq and the United States should take steps on this issue because this is an issue of a struggle against terrorism," Erdogan said in an interview aboard his plane during campaigning in eastern Turkey late on Tuesday. Asked if he believed Baghdad and Washington would honour promises to combat the PKK, Erdogan's response was lukewarm. "I wish to remain positive." Washington, while classing the PKK as a terrorist group, fears any major operation by its NATO ally in northern Iraq could anger Iraqi Kurdish allies and stoke wider conflict in a relatively peaceful region of that war-torn country. TROOPS ON THE BORDER Financial markets were rattled earlier this month by reports of a major incursion into northern Iraq, which Turkey denied. Military sources said there had been a limited cross-border raid -- a relatively frequent occurrance since the mid-1990s. Any major cross-border operation would require parliament's approval. Parliament, where Erdogan's AK Party has a big majority, is currently in recess ahead of July elections. "We are continuing discussions with the armed forces. If needed we will take the necessary steps (for a cross-border operation) because we cannot allow the PKK any longer to carry out attacks," Erdogan said through an interpreter. The armed forces have recommended a cross-border offensive into northern Iraq, where up to 4,000 PKK rebels are based. Tens of thousands of troops have been sent to the border. Analysts say the threat of an incursion may have as much to do with domestic politics ahead of the July 22 election as with security issues. Nationalist concerns over Kurdish separatism and EU attitudes towards Turkey are playing an important role. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and the European Union. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since it launched an armed campaign for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 19
