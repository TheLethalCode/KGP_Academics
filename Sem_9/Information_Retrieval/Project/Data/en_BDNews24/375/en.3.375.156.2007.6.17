<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday slated people in high offices for misusing their powers, which created trouble for others. In a scholarship awarding ceremony at Osmani Memorial Auditorium, Islam said: "We, who are at the apex of society, show off our powers by creating problems for others." "The extent of our power seems to rely on how much we can create nuisance," he said, advising awardees to avoid such attitude when they would reach top levels after studies. As part of corporate social responsibility, Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited organised the event to distribute awards among 200 poor and meritorious students who passed HSC exams. Each awardee will get Tk 2,000 in monthly scholarship funds and an annual allocation of Tk 5,000 to meet their academic expenses up to post-grad level. The adviser said the government has attached highest priority to education. "But it's not yet possible for the government to meet the entire demand of the education sector," he added. Islam called upon organisations, such as the DBBL, to take similar steps for the betterment of society. "A nation cannot prosper without the development of its human resources," he said. He said there are many countries developing themselves by building only human resourcesthe countries with almost no natural resources. DBBL managing director Yeasin Ali said the bank spends about Tk 4 crore a year for the education sector. They have similar programmes for the health sector and other programmes that respond to natural calamities. bdnew
