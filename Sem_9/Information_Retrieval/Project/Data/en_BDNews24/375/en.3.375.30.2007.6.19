<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has decided to open voter registration desks in the embassies for expatriate Bangladeshis to become voters. Election commissioner Muhammad Sahul Hossain Tuesday said Bangladeshis will register and get listed in the digital voter record after other regular procedures. They will cast their votes in postal ballots, he said. The commission believes that 80 lakh Bangladeshis live abroad. Hossain said a government officer would be appointed as assistant registration officer to each registration desk at the Bangladesh missions. The expatriates will also get national IDs after voter ID registration at the desks. "We will finalise the matter after a revision of 'Representation of People Order, 1972' after discussions with the home and the foreign ministries." bdnew
