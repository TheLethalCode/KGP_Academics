 BAGHDAD, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led coalition forces killed at least 20 militants after coming under heavy attack from Shia gunmen during raids in southern Iraq's Maysan province early on Monday, the US military said. An official in the office of anti-American Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the Maysan capital Amara said 17 members of the firebrand's Mehdi Army had been killed and 45 wounded. That would mark one of the deadliest incidents between US-led forces and the Mehdi Army since a major security crackdown was launched in Iraq four months ago. Local officials said British and Iraqi forces were involved in the raids in Amara and the nearby town of Majjar al-Kabir, which the US military said targeted militants smuggling weapons from neighbouring Iran into Iraq. American forces also took part in the operation, said US military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Garver, describing it as one of the biggest in months outside Baghdad against networks trying to smuggle in arms from Iran. Maysan has a long border with Shia Iran, which Washington accuses of arming, funding and training Shi'ite militias in Iraq. Tehran denies the charge. During the operations, coalition forces came under heavy small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenade attacks in both places, the US military said in a statement. "Using appropriate escalation of force measures, ground forces were forced to use close air support to suppress the enemy fire. During the close air support, at least 20 terrorists were killed," the statement said, without saying if American or British aircraft were used. Garver said another statement would be issued to give more details. An official in Sadr's office in Amara said all the Mehdi Army members were killed in Majjar al-Kabir. He said clashes erupted there after the raid began, adding an air strike followed soon after. The Mehdi Army militia is active across Iraq's south. It also has a stronghold in the Baghdad Shi'ite slum of Sadr City. There have been periodic clashes between U.S. forces and the militia since the major security crackdown was launched in Baghdad and surrounding regions in February, but the militia for the most part has kept a low profile in the capital. Latif al-Tamimi, head of the security committee on Maysan's provincial council, said 16 people including two women and a child had been killed and 45 wounded in the pre-dawn raids. He said 11 were killed in Majjar al-Kabir and five in Amara. Tamini called the operation a "catastrophe", accusing troops of firing randomly. Tamini said the Iraqi government should explain why the raids were carried out. A British military spokesman said the raids were led by Iraqi special forces troops with backing from multi-national force soldiers. He had few other details. British forces handed back security control of Maysan to Iraqi security forces in April. The US statement said militants detained during the raids were believed to be members of a network known for transporting weapons and lethal roadside bombs known as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, from Iran into Iraq, as well as bringing militants from Iraq to Iran for training. It said the raids were coordinated with Iraq's government. "Intelligence reports indicate both Amarah and Majjar al-Kabir are known safe havens and smuggling routes for militants who facilitate Iranian lethal aid," it said. Overwhelmingly Shia, Maysan, home to the Marsh Arabs and with large oil fields, has been spared much of the sectarian violence engulfing Baghdad and other areas that is pushing Iraq to the brink of all-out civil w
