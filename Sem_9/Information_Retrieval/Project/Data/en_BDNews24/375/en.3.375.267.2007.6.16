<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Tight security clamped around Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan was relaxed Saturday. The first tier of the three-tier security blanket thrown around the home was removed after several days of heightened watch home ahead of her tentative plan to fly to the United States Friday. A security officer present there said 'higher authorities' ordered them to ease security. Hasina's political adviser Saber Hossain Chowdhury, women affairs secretary Dr Dipu Moni and workers affairs secretary Habibur Rahman went to meet Hasina in the morning. Before leaving Sudha Sadan at 3:15 pm, Saber said, "I have to attend another meeting. I will talk to you later." "Sheikh Hasina is disappointed for failing to go to America," Rahman said while departing an hour before Hossain. On whether the AL was going to take any legal steps against Hasina's being stopped from leaving the country, Rahman said, "There is no chance for that as yet." bdnews24.com/su
