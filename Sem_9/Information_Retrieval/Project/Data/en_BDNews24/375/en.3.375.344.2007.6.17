<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Russel KC returned to the winning streak in the B. League with a 4-3 win over Chittagong Abahani Limited in the second-leg eventful encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Sunday. The sixth win in 13 matches put the new powerhouse of football to the top of the point table again with 23 points which are equal points of League leaders, Dhaka Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club. Abahani, however, played one match short of Mohammedan and Russel's 13. All seven goals of the day came after the barren first half and both teams were reduced to 10 men after the 69th minute as Russel's Moroccan striker Touati Youness and Abahani's Nigerian defender Othello Bonei were sent off following a scuffle in the off-ball situation. After trailing by four goals, the sky-blues outfit of the port city struck three goals in the space of eight minutes to bring a short-lived excitement at the crowd- starved big bowl, but the visitors had to satisfy with a nominal margin of defeat against the hosts after losing the first-leg match against the same rivals by 3-0 at home. The players of both sides struggled to control themselves on the rain-soaked slippery pitch, and they comparatively showed a fast-paced game, but Abahani's "immature" players failed to cope with Sheikh Russel's players in the second half to leave the field with the ninth defeat in 13 matches. Eight minutes into the second half, Moroccan midfielder Noureddine Zaim from the right set his compatriot Touati Youness outside the box and Youness sent the ball to the nearer post with a sudden 30-yard shot to give Sheikh Russel a lead. Four minutes later, Moroccan Noureddine doubled the lead from a close range exploiting a defence lapse of Abahani's while his compatriot playmaker Ighir Mohammad made it 3-0 with a low-curving shot inside the box after receiving a back-heel of substitute Maksudul Amin Bulbul in the 63rd minute. Then, Ighir fed substitute Mashud Parvez Kaiser, who struck the fourth goal inside the box giving Abahani's substitute goalie Khokon any chance and it seemed all excitement evaporated. But, two minutes later, Khokon Das reduced the margin for Abahani after capitalizing a right-side cross from Nigerian Abraham Bobby Fanny, who made the margin 4-2 converting a penalty shot after Russel's defender Prodeep brought down opponent Anisur Rahman in the 85th minute. Two minutes from the time, Sheikh Russel conceded a suicidal goal by Moroccan Rida Saadane, who sent the ball home trying to clear a fierce-cross by Abahani's Jahangir Alam from the right . "I am happy with the result in line with the condition of the pitch," said Russel coach Wazed Gazi. Abahani coach Swapan Kumar Das said, "The boys performed as expected, but the immature players failed to cope with the experienced players of the opponents in the second half." Abahani manager SM Saifuddin claimed that they were deprived of two penalty shots due to poor refereeing.
