 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Md Nurunnabi and Suraiya Begum have been appointed to the Public Service Commission as members, the government said in a statement Wednesday. Md Nurunnabi had earlier served the labour and employment ministry as acting secretary and Suraiya Begum worked for Home Economics College in Dhaka as principal. The establishment ministry Wednesday issued a circular on the appointments. Their appointments came after the recent resignations of five PSC members. PSC members Anwarul Haque, Prof AKM Shahadat Hossain Mondal, Latifur Rahman and Prof Fazlul Haque resigned Sunday. Another PSC member, Ashraful Islam Chowdhury, chairman of the 27th BCS exam committee, resigned on June 14. Professor Ashraf's resignation came after the 27th BCS oral exam was cancelled on May 30 amid broader allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism surrounding the exams. He was appointed to the PSC on May 30, 2004. The interim cabinet on May 30 cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams in a move meant to restore trust of people in the Public Service Commission and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports questioning the transparency of BCS exams. Another member of the commission, Prof Mahfuzur Rahman, has been evading arrest as he appears on the corruption watchdog's list of graft suspects. bdnews24
