 DURHAM, England, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored his second consecutive test century to help West Indies to a respectable 287 all out at tea on the third day of the fourth and final test on Sunday. The tenacious Chanderpaul, dropped on nine by third slip Ian Bell on Saturday evening, finished on 136 not out to complete an impressive West Indies' fightback from 55 for four. Chanderpaul has now batted 804 minutes in the series without being dismissed. Despite two quick wickets after lunch, when West Indies slumped to 229 for nine, Chanderpaul controlled a 10th-wicket stand of 58 with Corey Collymore (13) in 98 minutes. Left-arm pace bowler Ryan Sidebottom claimed his first five-wicket test haul. The Guyanese middle-order batsman faced 257 deliveries and stroked 18 boundaries and a six for his 16th test hundred that follows on from the unbeaten 116 he scored at Old Trafford in the third test. He is now averaging 188 in the series. Chanderpaul was untroubled for most of his innings although he was struck on his left forearm by a short Steve Harmison ball that he attempted to pull but was beaten for pace. He required immediate attention from the team physiotherapist. He showed there were no ill-effects by cutting a short and wide Harmison delivery to the boundary to go to 102. He knelt down and kissed the pitch. Next over, to Sidebottom, he perhaps played the best shot of his innings when his fluent drive through extra cover hit the boundary rope at good pace. The ninth wicket, when Sidebottom bowled Fidel Edwards, gave the left-arm swing bowler his fifth wicket and he finished with five for 88 from 29 overs. Before lunch Matthew Hoggard became England's sixth-highest wicket-taker in test history when he bowled Dwayne Bravo off his inside edge, surpassing Alec Bedser's 236 victims. Chanderpaul registered the 50 stand with Collymore by sweeping spinner Monty Panesar for six over midwicket. The first day was completely washed out and just 40.4 overs were possible on Saturday. England are seeking to finish the series with a third straight victory after taking an unassailable 2-0 lead last week, following an innings win at Headingley and a draw at Lord'
