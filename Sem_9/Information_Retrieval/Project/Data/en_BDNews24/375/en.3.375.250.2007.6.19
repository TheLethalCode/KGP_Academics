<TITLE> NBR to slap 250% penalty on untaxed money after July 31 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue will go for tougher actions, including imposing up to 250 percent penalty charge, against those who do not legalise their undisclosed income by the July 31 deadline. "I hope people will take the opportunity," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told businessmen at a post-budget discussion, organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Tuesday. "After the deadline, the NBR will opt for a tax drive against those who possess untaxed money," Rahman said. The NBR issued a statutory regulatory order (SRO) on June 5 to facilitate the legalisation of undisclosed income by paying a 5.0 percent penalty in addition to the normal tax rate with a time frame of two months until July 31. The NBR chairman also said that those against whom cases are being filed for alleged tax evasion would not be eligible for the facility. Rahman made his comments following a query by FBCCI vice-president Dewan Sultan Ahmed, who said the SRO provision is complicated and does not encourage people to disclose and legalise their untaxed income. "There is no ambiguity, it is as simple as anything," Badiur Rahman said. "I've asked my officials not to harass anybody or demand more information than name, address and tax identification number of the person who intends to take the opportunity." Under the facility anyone who has failed to disclose any part of his/her income made through fair means in their tax returns during the past five years will be allowed to legalise the money. "If tax works out to be Tk 100, a person has to pay an additional Tk 5," he said. However, the NBR is yet to get any major response to the provision, officials said. Only half a dozen of people had taken advantage of the opportunity up to Sunday, they said. bdn
