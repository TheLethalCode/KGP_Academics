 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks gained for a third day Tuesday amid a rally in most sectors including banks. Mutual funds, insurance and pharmaceutical stocks went up but profit-taking pushed down power stocks. "It's a good sign. A rise in bank stocks rather than power ones is welcome, as there remains the possibility of good earnings. Banking is more regulated than the other sectors," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, which manages about Tk 600 million in funds. The DGEN or general index ended on a new high at 2062.59, up 15.38 points or 0.75 percent from the previous day. The DSI or all-share price index added 7.16 points or 0.42 percent to close at 1685.10. The DSE-20 blue chip index rallied 19.71 points or 1.08 percent to 1835.81. All the indices on the CSE finished upbeat. Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange declined to Tk 1.49 billion from Monday's Tk 1.53 billion. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, it declined to Tk 216.57 million from Tk 237.90 million. A block deal encouraged the shares of Southeast Bank, the top issue in turnover, to gain 4.50 percent to end at Tk 475.5o. It recorded Tk 160.54 million in turnover. Square Pharma, the second top issue in turnover at Tk 101.79 million, advanced 2.19 percent to Tk 3796.50 on hopes of earning good dividends. Summit Power fell 0.78 percent to Tk 921.75 after investors locked in gains. Prime Bank gained 1.29 percent to Tk 800.75. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, fifth top issue in turnover, slipped 0.84 percent to Tk 588. Top gainers were Rose Heaven Ball Pen, Sino Bangla and BD Thai Aluminium. Samata Leather, Bextex and Standard Ceramic were the main losers. On the DSE, 127 issues gained, 65 fell and 14 held steady. A total of 67 issues advanced, 42 dropped and 11 closed unchanged on the CSE. bdn
