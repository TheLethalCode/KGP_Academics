 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) - Sheikh Hasina wants to bring broader reforms to the Awami League to ensure transparency and accountability, AL leader Faruk Khan said Sunday. In an interview with bdnews24.com, the commerce and industry secretary of the AL said Hasina wants deeper reforms but she cannot single-handedly accept or reject proposals. "Reforms won't happen verbally. With due respect to those who are speaking of reforms, I want to say that our leader [Hasina] cannot solely decide on their proposals. The party constitution doesn't allow her alone to accept proposals," Khan said in his Karwan Bazar business office. He continued: "There is an apparent move to scrap two leaders [Hasina and Khaleda Zia] from politics. This is not reform. Reforms mean ensuring transparency and accountability in the parties." Asked about the probable reforms to the AL, Khan said that after such reforms a single party member would not be allowed to hold more than one major post, no person would be able to hold a central committee post for more than two terms and party leadership would be finalised through secret ballots. Khan rejected the allegation that there was no practice of democracy within the Awami League. He referred to the latest central working committee meeting of the party where Hasina was asked to explain why the AL had signed an agreement with Islamist outfit Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish. Following that meeting, Hasina stressed reforms within the party and asked central committee members to submit written proposals on reforms. A committee led by organising secretary Syed Ashraful Islam was assigned to monitor the reform process, Khan said. The former lawmaker said Hasina wants broader reforms than the proposed six-point or 21-point reforms. The party chief wants more transparency and accountability in the party, he added. Asked if the party leaders speaking publicly about reforms would face any action, Faruk said: "We must go ahead together. The way they are talking is not right. Counselors will decide their fate." He said the government must cooperate to bring reforms to political parties. He asked the government to start party registration immediately. Faruk believes the present interim administration came into being to help the political parties, not destroy them. "Forming a new political party to eradicate us will not bring about any good result," he said. bdnews24.c
