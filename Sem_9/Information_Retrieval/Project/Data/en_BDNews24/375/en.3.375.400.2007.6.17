<TITLE> Sri Lanka facing attacks, international isolation: analysts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Colombo, 17 June, (bdnews24.com/AFP)-- Sri Lanka has vowed to wage more attacks against Tamil rebels but analysts warn it faces the prospect of devastating retaliation and risks international isolation over rising rights abuses. State-run media said last week that Tamil Tiger rebels were preparing for attacks on the capital's harbour, oil storage complex and electricity supply in response to government attacks in the north and east. Both sides suffered heavy losses earlier this month when the army advanced into rebel-held territory but was beaten back by a major counter-attack. "The territory captured in the northern theatre after months of operations was lost in a single day when the Tigers hit back," defence analyst Namal Perera said. "The signs are that we are headed for a prolonged stalemate." The fighting has raised the prospect of widening conflict in the island nation of 19.5 million that could severely damage the economy and isolate the government, former Sri Lankan diplomat Nanda Godage said. "We could be heading in the direction of sanctions," Godage said. The war is already affecting areas like tourism and aid flows as the economy slowed sharply in the first quarter, growing 6.1 percent compared to 7.9 percent in the same period last year while inflation averaged 19.7 percent, compared to 7.2 percent for the same quarter last year. Britain and Germany have withdrawn some aid to the country although key Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi said this month that further aid cuts would be counter-productive to efforts to resume peace talks. The Tigers are already banned as a terrorist group in the United States, EU, and Canada and strong efforts have been made to stop them raising funds from the diaspora in those countries. Despite international pressure, both sides have hardened their positions on peace talks and vowed intensified efforts to carry on the bitter ethnic conflict which has claimed 60,000 lives in the past 35 years. The result is expected to be a wave of violence, said Sunanda Deshapriya, director of the private Centre for Policy Alternatives think-tank. "We will see more violence," Deshapriya said. "There is no mood in the country to compromise and resume talks." Top defence officials have said they will need about two to three years to subdue the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) led by elusive leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and force them to talks, an outcome the rebels say is impossible. "The LTTE and the Tamil people under no circumstances will come to the table in a position of political and military weakness," rebel political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said recently. The guerrillas have already used radar-evading low-flying light aircraft to bomb military and economic targets, forcing Sri Lanka to shut its sole international airport at night. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake announced last week that the LTTE had rigged a truck with more than 1,000 kilos (2,200 pounds) of explosives which he claimed was enough to destroy half of Colombo. "We are told that there is a second truck with the same quantity of explosives," he said. At the same time, the government has come under increased international pressure to clean up its human rights record including widespread disappearances and extra-judicial killings. Rights groups and diplomats have accused government forces and their allies of killing hundreds of civilians since a new surge of fighting began in December 2005. Britain's junior foreign minister, Kim Howells, during a visit here last week said London was worried about growing rights abuses and an escalation in the conflict, which has left thousands dead in recent months. "Sri Lanka runs the risk of isolation," Howells said, referring to growing international concerns on rights abuses in the island. "Human rights is the prime test of whether or not a state conducts itself with modern values." His comments came after the government evicted hundreds of ethnic Tamils from the capital this month, saying they were a security threat, and then apologised and allowed them back under international pressu
