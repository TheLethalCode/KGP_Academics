 Kathmandu, Jun 19 (bdnews24.com/PTI) At least 20 children, who were suffering from diarrhoea, died due to lack of medicines and proper health facilities in the remote hilly area of Khin village in Kalikot district of Nepal. The children suffering from the disease died due to lack of medicines and health workers between mid-May and mid-June, according to officials. Some 300 people in the area are suffering from the disease and the lack of medication has turned the situation worst, they said. Shivaraj Buddha, a local resident, said he walked three days to get treatment for his three-year-old son after he failed to find medicine and health workers even at the Area Health Centre in the neighbouring village. The Chief District Administrator Omkar Prasad Neupane said a team of five health workers have been sent to the area with necessary medicines on Saturday.
