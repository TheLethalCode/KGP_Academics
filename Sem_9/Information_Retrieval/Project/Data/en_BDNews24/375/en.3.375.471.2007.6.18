Tofail Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the government had done a remarkable task, and the nation grateful to it. The Awami League government had managed to bring two of the Bangabandhu murder convicts back, the AL presidium member said. Tofail hit out at the past BNP-led government saying: "The past BNP-led government rehabilitated Bangabandhu's killers instead of trying them."
