<TITLE> Harmison to undergo hernia operation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DURHAM, ENGLAND (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Steve Harmison is set to undergo a hernia operation, though team management are yet to decide when he will have the surgery. The 28-year-old, who is playing in the fourth and final test against West Indies, was expected to turn out for county team Durham in a domestic cup semi-final on Wednesday. His availability will now have to be confirmed by England medics. "Steve Harmison has a non-serious hernia and he will require surgery at some stage," England spokesman Andrew Walpole told reporters on Tuesday. "The injury is not currently affecting his bowling at this time. "The timing of the surgery will be decided by the England medical team. We haven't pulled him out of the semi-final (yet). That decision will be made at the end of the test match." Harmison is likely to be operated on soon so that he does not miss much of the three-test series against India which will begin at Lord's on July 19
