<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pop star Michael Jackson reached a settlement on Monday with a New Jersey financial company that brought a $48 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against him. Prescient Acquisition Group, which claimed Jackson reneged on payments he owed for helping him refinance more than $200 million in bank loans, settled with the entertainer as the case was about to go to trial in US District Court in Manhattan. Terms of Prescient's agreement with Jackson and his MJ Publishing Trust were not disclosed. Prescient sued Jackson in July 2005 for $48 million, the amount it claimed he owed the firm for serving as intermediary in a refinancing deal that allowed him to avoid foreclosure on loans secured by his prized stake in the Beatles song catalog. Specifically, Prescient said it had arranged to secure the financing Jackson needed to pay off $272.5 million in debt originally provided by Bank of America and later sold to the New York-based hedge fund Fortress Investment Group. The refinancing deal ultimately was reached in April 2006 with help from Sony, which jointly owns rights to more than 200 Beatles songs - and thousands of songs by other artists -- with Jackson through Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Sources with knowledge of the refinancing package said at the time that Jackson had negotiated a lower interest rate on his debt and agreed to provide Sony with an option to buy about half of his 50 percent stake in the music catalog. Jackson, whose music career has long been overshadowed by accusations of sex abuse and by media attention on his eccentric lifestyle, was acquitted in June 2005 of all charges in a child molestation trial. But according to testimony during the sensational case, years of extravagant spending left Jackson mired in debt. A default last year by Jackson would have allowed Fortress to seize his interest in the Beatles catalog, valued at some $500 million. A spokesman for Jackson told Reuters the settlement with Prescient means that the archive of music publishing rights would remain "safe and sound." The settlement with Prescient -- whose owner, Darien Dash, is a cousin of hip-hop mogul Damon Dash -- removes one of numerous civil court actions that have entangled the self-styled king of pop in recent years. Remaining litigation includes a lawsuit filed by former lawyer Brent Ayscough, who claims Jackson owes him about $200,000 in unpaid legal fees, and a court battle with his former accountan
