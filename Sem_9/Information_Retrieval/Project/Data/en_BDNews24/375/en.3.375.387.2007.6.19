 Kanul, June-19, (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Afghan forces admitted Tuesday that the Taliban had captured a district in mountainous southern Afghanistan in the latest upsurge of rebels strikes that have killed scores of people. The interior ministry announced meanwhile that 10 civilians and up to 60 Taliban were killed in days of fighting in Uruzgan province but rejected claims by locals that dozens more were killed in NATO bombing raids. The insurgents said they captured mountainous Myanishen district in the southern province of Kandahar late Monday. The interior ministry said Tuesday that police had left the area. "It was a temporary tactical withdrawal," ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP. "We plan to retake the district by launching an operation." He dismissed a claim by the Taliban that 10 policemen were killed. Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP the police had fled into the mountains after being under siege for two days. "Finally last night at 10:00 pm we totally captured the district centre," he said. The rebels were in control of the district administration offices and had taken possession of government vehicles and weapons. The insurgents -- waging a battle to reclaim Afghanistan, which was governed by the Taliban between 1996 and 2001 -- have overrun several district centres in the south and west but have usually been pushed out after a few days. They have however have held for months Musa Qala district in Helmand province, which adjoins Uruzgan and Kandahar, and are said to control several others in the area.

Bashary said Tuesday 10 civilians and four policemen had been killed by the Taliban and "50 to 60 enemy elements" were also dead. He said claims that scores more civilians died in bombing raids were "not true." Uruzgan provincial council chief Mawlawi Hamdullah told AFP late Monday accounts from the area suggested around 60 civilians may have been killed, most of them in bombing raids. "We may be able in course of days to determine the exact number of dead and wounded. Now we can only talk about estimation," he said. About 100 people were in a hospital in the provincial capital Tirin Kot but there were others wounded who were not able to leave Chora, he said, calling for helicopters to be sent to the district to airlift them out. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said late Monday it had no reports of civilian deaths but believed around 50-60 Taliban may have been killed. "The fighting in Uruzgan still goes on," spokesman Major John Thomas told AFP Tuesday. "About civilians, there is nothing new since last night. But Taliban are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties." Unrest linked to the Taliban insurgency has peaked in the past few days with the insurgents' deadliest attack in Kabul on Sunday killing 35 people, most of them police training instructors. It was the fifth suicide bombing in the country in three days. Most were aimed at foreign security forces but killed more civilians, who are increasingly becoming victims in the fight for Afghanistan. Seven children were killed late Sunday in an air strike by the US-led coalition force targeted at Al-Qaeda fighters in the east of the country. Days earlier five children died in a Taliban suicide blast in Tiri
