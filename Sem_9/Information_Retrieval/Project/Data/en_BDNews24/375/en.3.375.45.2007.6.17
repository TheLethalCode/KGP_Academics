<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh team left Dhaka Saturday night for Sri Lanka on a five-week tour to play three-match Test series and as many one-dayers. The Tigers are expected to reach the emerald islands Sunday morning. "Though we could not play well against Sri Lanka in the past, this time around we will like to see a good team effort instead of individual performances," said captain Mohammad Ashraful at the Zia International Airport before boarding the plane. Bangladesh have a poor away record against Sri Lanka; their previous two full series earned them four innings defeats and a huge 288-run loss in five Tests. The Tigers have said they want to shake off poor Test efforts and take all three Test matches to the fifth day. Bangladesh will open their tour with a three-day match on June 20-22 in Colombo before the first Test starts on June 25-29. The second Test and the final Test start on July 3 and July 11 while the three one-dayers are billed for July 20, 22 and 24. "I will try to enjoy the Test as I am now free from pressure of captaincy. I will try to put in my best as a senior player," said Habibul Bashar, who is 116 runs short of scoring 3000 Test runs. Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Tushar Imran, Farhad Reza and debutant Mahmudullah Riad will join the Tigers to play one-day series at the end of the Test series. Test squad: Mohammad Ashraful, (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Shahriar Nafees, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Saqib Al Hasan, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Mohammad Sharif, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Rafique and Syed Rasel.
