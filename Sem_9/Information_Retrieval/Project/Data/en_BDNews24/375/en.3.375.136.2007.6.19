 TAORMINA, Italy, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than a year after its premiere, 'The Da Vinci Code' is being investigated by Italian state attorneys on the grounds that it is 'obscene' from a religious perspective.

The defendants cannot be extradited for the charges, but they can be apprehended if they are already on Italian soil.

"I don't know," the official said in a telephone interview. "Maybe they (the clergy who filed the complaint) have just seen the film." Both the book and film version of 'Da Vinci' attracted widespread criticism from religious groups, but this appears to be the first time parties have taken legal action against the wo
