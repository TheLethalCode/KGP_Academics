 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday allowed an ACC official to question former lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu for four more days in remand on charges of hoarding and misappropriating government relief tin sheets, blankets and rice. Officials of the Anticorruption Commission have been empowered to interrogate any graft suspects in line with a new ordinance. The fresh spell of remand for the BNP leader came after a two-phase seven-day interrogation ended. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokan issued the order at 12.30pm in presence of Falu. ACC assistant director Sheikh Abdus Salam, the investigating officer of the case, sought a seven-day remand for Falu. The remand prayer mentioned that 200 bundles of CI sheets were allocated for Dhaka-10 constituency for distribution among people, affected by cyclone, fire incidents, earthquake and river erosion. Falu, misusing his authority, gave away the relief to the party henchmen, according to case details. Falu has not yet given any specific statement about the hoarding and embezzlement of relief, which prompted a new appeal for further remand. RAB-2 officers seized relief tin, rice and blankets from the Dhaka City Corporation ward No. 37 commissioner Ruhul Amin Jahangir's office on March 2. A case was filed against six people, including Falu, under the Emergency Powers Rules. bdnews24
