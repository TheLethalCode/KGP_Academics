 Madrid, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham and Roberto Carlos were given a victorious send-off from the Bernabeu when they made their final appearances for Real Madrid as the team grabbed the league title with a 3-1 comeback win over Real Mallorca. Former England captain Beckham was given a massive cheer by the 76,000 fans crammed into the Real Madrid stadium on Sunday when he limped off the pitch with his side losing 1-0 midway through the second half. But the 32-year-old achieved his ambition of winning a major trophy before leaving the nine-times European champions when his side produced their customary late show to roar to victory over the islanders. "I'm so happy, it's incredible and great to have all the family here," Beckham told reporters as he took to the pitch draped in a flag of St George and accompanied by his three sons to celebrate after Real's victory. Romeo, Brooklyn and Cruz accompanied their father with shirts bearing his number 23 and the word "Daddy" on the back as the midfielder did a lap of honour and then kissed the pitch as he bade farewell to the assembled Real fans. Beckham's wife Victoria watched on from the stands with friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes who are expected to introduce the couple to the Hollywood social scene when they move to Los Angeles. "It has been an incredible experience but all I'll remember now are the great things and the good things because winning this tonight puts to bed everything else," Beckham said. Beckham played 157 games for Real in total but his only previous trophy was the Spanish Super Cup which he won when they beat Mallorca shortly after signing for the club from Manchester United in 2003. Roberto Carlos, in contrast, ended 11 years at the Bernabeu with more than 500 games under his belt, four league titles and three European Cups. The Brazilian won his first league title for Real a decade ago in Fabio Capello's first spell as coach of the Spanish giants. "You have to enjoy a moment like this, but I think I'll be crying later when I speak to my family " said the 34-year-old Brazilian who has signed a two-year deal with Turkish side Fenerbahce. "I hope the Bernabeu will always be like this, this was a very important title for the club
