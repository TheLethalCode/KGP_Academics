<TITLE> Abbas cabinet a chance for Palestinian state: Bush, Olmert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington,(bdnews24.com/reuters/AFP) US President George W Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert Tuesday offered strong support for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, hoping he could pave the way towards renewed talks on creating a Palestinian state. "Our hope is that president Abbas and the prime minister (Salam) Fayyad will be strengthened to the point where they can lead the Palestinians in a different direction with a different hope," said Bush. Abbas expelled the radical Islamist Hamas movement from the Palestinian unity government on Sunday after it seized control of the Gaza Strip in days of bloody battles which left 110 people dead. He appointed in its place a moderate emergency cabinet based in the West Bank. Ahead of two hours of one-on-one talks, Bush and Olmert sought to bolster Abbas's position, whose move has encountered some Palestinian criticism, with both affirming "he is the president of all the Palestinian people." "I want to strengthen the moderates and cooperate with president Abbas," said Olmert, who was meeting Bush for the third time in just over a year. The two leaders said the new cabinet was also a chance for renewing the stalled talks between Israel and the Palestinians based on Bush's 2002 vision for a two-state solution to Middle East peace. "We share a common vision of two states living side-by-side in peace," Bush said at the White House before the start of talks with Olmert. He nevertheless refused to put down a clear timeframe for the creation of a Palestinian state. His proposals for two states have failed to materialize since the breakdown of peace talks in 2000. "I am going to make every possible effort to move forward to see how things can be worked jointly, in order to provide Palestinians a real, genuine chance for a state of their own," added Olmert. He said earlier this week he was ready to renew regular contacts with the Palestinian president in order "to resolve the outstanding daily issues and move forward to finding ways to solve grander issues." On Monday, the European Union and the United States lifted a 15-month crippling economic and political boycott imposed on the Palestinians after Hamas, which refuses to recognize the Jewish state, won last year's Palestinian elections. Hundreds of millions of dollars were expected to start flowing to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and Israel has also agreed to unfreeze some 600 million dollars in Palestinian tax revenue it has withheld. Hamas has reacted angrily to news of the resumption of aid. "By announcing their political and financial support for the Palestinian Authority, the West is backing an illegitimate government," Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Bush vowed to use the new reality in order strengthen Abbas and his cabinet, which has control only over the West Bank after Hamas routed all forces loyal to Abbas's Fatah movement from the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians "need help to build the institutions necessary for democracy to flourish. They need help to build security forces so that they could end up enforcing what most people want, which is to live in peace," Bush said. Abbas is expected to make a key-note speech outlining his plans for the Palestinian political future on Wednesday. "He will explain what has happened in Gaza, the measures he has taken and the decisions that are going to be implemented," his spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina said in Ramallah. The political turmoil within the Palestinian Authority sealed the divide between the West Bank and Gaza, where Hamas remains the sole ruler, creating a radical pro-Iranian entity on Israel's doorstep. "It was Hamas that attacked the unity government. They made a choice of violence. It was their decision that has caused there to be the current situation in the Middle East," said Bush. A senior Israeli official said the Jewish state wishes to prevent Hamas, which won the January 2006 elections by a landslide, from returning to a power-sharing government. "While things are moving positively in the West Bank, we cannot ignore what is taking place in the Gaza Strip, and we must find ways to contain the Gaza crisis and weaken Hamas," the official said. Israel on Tuesday briefly opened the border crossings into Gaza which it had closed down following last week's clashes, allowing badly-needed food and medical equipment to enter the overcrowded and impoverished territo
