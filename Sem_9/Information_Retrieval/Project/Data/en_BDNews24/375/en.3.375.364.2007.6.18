<TITLE> Mohiuddin appeal depends on SC nod: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein Monday said it was up to the Appellate Division to decide if Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed qualifies to appeal against his conviction. "Mohiuddin is a convict. He will stay in jail. If the Appellate Division allows him to appeal against the verdict, he can go ahead like other accused," Mainul told reporters in his law ministry office. A court sent the former major to Dhaka Central Jail Monday after he was deported to Bangladesh from the US. Mainul said the law would take its own course and the government had nothing to do with it. Asked whether a new bench will be reconstituted, Mainul said: "It's up to court. The court will look into it." The law ministry will assist the court if necessary, he said. Asked to confirm if the government would take further steps to bring back other convicts of the Bangabandhu Murder Case from abroad, the adviser said the caretaker government had been installed for a short time and it was working to fulfil the expectations of people. "The government has many more important things to do," he said. "However if any environment is created for bringing back other convicts, the government must take action," he said. bdnew
