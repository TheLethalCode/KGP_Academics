 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has sealed the warehouse of Warid Telecom in Tejgaon on charges of dodging value-added tax and supplementary duty, a senior official said Sunday. The NBR official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that the new mobile operator did not show correct figures of SIM card sales in its tax returns. The warehouse was closed Thursday night. The NBR official said Warid had sold or delivered about seven lakh SIM cards from the warehouse from May 9 to May 31, but paid VAT and supplementary duty on about two lakh. The warehouse will be open after the telecoms operator pays the full amount of VAT and supplementary duty on the SIM and 'scratch' cards, delivered from the warehouse, the NBR official said. bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Sohel Parvez saw some documents on the NBR official's desk, seized from Warid. Asked by bdnews24.com, Ashraf Chowdhury, general manager (government relations) for Warid, said he would not respond to any queries by phone. He said he was not aware of the shutdown of the warehouse. Speaking on behalf of Warid, M Shamsur Rahman, CEO of Impact PR, said: "The allegations are not entirely true." And Rahman added: "It's also not true that it had been entirely shut down." "The tax collectors raised a question about VAT, which is expected to be resolved next working week," Rahman told bdnews24.com. bd
