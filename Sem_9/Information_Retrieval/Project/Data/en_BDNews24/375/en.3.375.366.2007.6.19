 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)- Some leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party Monday demanded expulsions of party executive president Oli Ahmed and joint secretary general Shahadat Hossain Selim. A statement on the party's letterhead, signed by the party's media cell chief, claimed that two central committee members and seven leaders from front organisations sought the expulsions of the duo. The statement accused the two leaders of fraud in formulating and approving the party constitution. They also held them responsible for breaking party discipline. Shahadat Hossain Selim, however, trashed the statement, signed by Jahangir Alam. "The statement is false and fabricated. This is nothing but a conspiracy," he told bdnews24.com. Reached by phone, Convener of Liberal Doctors Association Dr Rafique Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that he was not part of any faction of the new party that had earlier claimed to begin alternative politics in the country. Dr Rafique's name was among the nine leaders who had demanded the expulsion. But he refused to say anything about the statement. The statement asked party president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and secretary general Abdul Mannan to clean up the party. Although no party constitution was formulated, Oli Ahmed gave false information about it to media, the statement claimed. It said Shahadat Hossain Selim took Tk 15 lakh from prospective nomination seekers for the forestalled Jan 22 election and later embezzled the money. The nine leaders pressing for expulsions are: organising secretary and convenor of Liberal Doctors Association Dr Rafique Chowdhury, LDP additional office secretary Wajed Ali Chowdhury Parvez, convenor of Democratic Mahila Dhara Ajmeri Begum Chhanda, member secretary Shamima Begum, convenor of Ganotantrik Muktijoddha Dhara Harun-or Rashid Khan, convenor of Ganotantrik Sechchchasebak Dhara Obaedur Rahman Mridha, Ganotantrik Jubo Dhara city convenor Jahangir Alam Biplob, member secretary Asaduzzaman Bachchu, Ganotantrik Sramik Dhara member secretary Azizur Rahman Akhand, city president of Sramik Dhara Aynul Haque, general secretary Ariful Haque Sumon, Ganotantrik Hawkers Dhara convenor Shahjahan Siraj Sabuj and member secretary Lokman Hossain Miaji. Meanwhile, another press statement signed by assistant office secretary Emran Hossain Prince congratulated the party presidium on formulating and approving the party constitution. Prince claimed that LDP vice president Abul Kashem, member of the advisory council Mobarak Hossain, joint secretary general Delwar Hossain and party colleague Maulana Khaled Saifullah backed him on the statement. bdnews24
