<TEXT>
 DURHAM, England, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards took his fourth wicket to keep the pressure on England before lunch on day four of the final test at Durham's Chester-le-Street ground on Monday. England were 202 for six at the interval after Edwards removed Andrew Strauss for 77 and fellow pace bowler Daren Powell dismissed Ian Bell for 11. Edwards has figures of four for 65 from 15 overs. West Indies scored 287 in their first innings. Resolute Paul Collingwood, 35 not out from 64 balls, batted solidly throughout the session and is attempting a salvation job that he is renowned for in one-day cricket. Matt Prior is on 16. Edwards, left out of the first two tests of the four-match series that England has already won, is providing penetration that did not exist before his inclusion. Opener Strauss, eyeing what would have been his first test century since August, added just five runs to his overnight score when he played a tentative push to Barbadian Edwards and got an edge to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin. Bell hung around for 49 minutes for 11 but perished two balls after the drinks break when Powell persuaded him to play a loose drive outside off stump and Runako Morton claimed a sharp chance at gully. All of England's wickets have been catches off the edge to either Ramdin, the slips or gully fielders. Prior scored his first runs with another edge, as he slashed Edwards between the two gully fielders. It was not the type of shot that would have given his anxious team mates much assurance. Seamer Corey Collymore bowled four wides in the 47th. At that stage West Indies had bowled 28 extras, all wides and no-balls. England have conceded one no-ball and no wides. England won at Headingley and Old Trafford after the first test at Lord's was drawn
