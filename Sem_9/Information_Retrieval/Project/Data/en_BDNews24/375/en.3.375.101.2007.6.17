<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed is on his way to Dhaka, a senior foreign ministry official said Sunday afternoon. "The process (of bringing him back) has begun," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters. The adviser did not give details, but one of his senior aides told bdnews24.com at 3.40pm Dhaka time: "He is on the plane now." The adviser said the foreign office had received a call at 2:40pm Bangladesh time from the Consul General in Los Angeles that the deportation started. The adviser refused to divulge details of the convict's flight to Dhaka apparently for security reasons, but gave enough indication that the former military officer was on his way to jail in Bangladesh, our correspondent Ahmed Dipu said after a briefing. The decision on deportation came after Mohiuddn lost his appeal to the US Federal Court Thursday not to deport him to Bangladesh, acting foreign secretary Towhid Hossain was quoted as saying by BBC Radio Friday. Some foreign ministry officials preferring anonymity had said Mohiuddin would be escorted straight to jail from airport. Earlier, the family of the former army major convicted of killing independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made emotional appeals for asylum in Canada after the US decided to deport him. Mohiuddin has lost his last appeal to stay on in the US, where he entered on a tourist visa in 1996 and stayed on illegally. Mohiuddin has been declared a fugitive after he was tried in absentia and convicted in 1998 for his part in the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. Mohiuddin is one of the many former soldiers, dubbed "killer majors", who was at large after being given safe passage. Some of them were given diplomatic assignments and now live outside Bangladesh. bdnews2
