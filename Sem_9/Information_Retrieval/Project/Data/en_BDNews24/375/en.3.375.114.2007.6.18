 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government decided Monday to increase emergency supply of food through an import of rice and wheat. The decision was taken in a meeting of the food monitoring committee at the finance ministry. After the meeting, the food monitoring committee's chairman and food adviser, Tapan Chowdhury, told bdnews24.com, "The government has a stock of 5 lakh tonnes of food grains. Beside the ongoing collection from local markets, we have decided to import 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 1.38 lakh tonnes of wheat." Although the formalities of international tenders take up 42 to 45 days, local tenders can, the adviser said, make it happen by 21 days. "There won't be any chance of running short of food grains in case flood or other natural calamities set in," Chowdhury said. On the price hike of flour in the local market, the adviser said, "The increase on the local market is an effect of the price hike on the international market." There was a plan to pull from the local markets 12 lakh tonnes of rice for reserve, with 45 percent of the amount already acquired, he said. bdnews24.com/
