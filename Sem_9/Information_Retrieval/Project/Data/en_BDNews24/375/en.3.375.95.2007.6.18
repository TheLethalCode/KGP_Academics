<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Dr Alejandro Cravioto, new executive director of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, on Sunday stressed a more efficient health system to cut the burden of diseases. "A more efficient health system must be developed to reduce the burden of diseases' in Bangladesh," he said. The Mexican-born researcher told reporters: "I am very happy to head the organisation which is the only international research institution in the developing world." Dr Cravioto, who replaces Dr David A Sack, has been the deputy executive director of the centre and a researcher for the last two years. His tenure as executive director will last three years. The center's latest chief said, "We'll focus on new programmes targeting tuberculosis and HIV/Aids. There is a lot of work to be done in those areas and we will have a different approach for this new research." Dr Cravioto, a noted scientist in the public health arena, thanked the government for supporting ICDDR,B. "This support allows the Centre to benefit not only Bangladesh but all countries of the world," he said. The new head of ICDDR,B is a leading researcher in childhood diarrhoea and vaccines. He expects to get more collaboration from development partners and expand the centre's areas of research. This year's budget is $25 million, a third of which will come from development partners and the rest from fund raising. "In fact, due to my predecessor's legacy, the centre is now more solid intellectually and financially. This allows us to discuss our future in a better way," Cravioto said. bdnew
