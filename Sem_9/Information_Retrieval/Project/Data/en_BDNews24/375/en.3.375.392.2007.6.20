<TITLE> Harmison considers bowling with hernia injury </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DURHAM June 19(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Steve Harmison may postpone a proposed hernia operation until the end of the season after a long spell on the final day of the fourth test against West Indies on Tuesday. Harmison took two for 92 from 20 overs as England wrapped up the series 3-0, bowling 12 consecutive overs after lunch. Earlier England and Wales Cricket Board spokesman Andrew Walpole described Harmison's problem as a "non-serious hernia" which was not affecting his bowling. Harmison, 28, said he would turn out for county team Durham in a domestic Cup semi-final on Wednesday and could bowl in the three-test series against India starting on July 19. "I felt something go in my back during the warm-up and it just got stiffer and stiffer but there was no way I was missing the test on my home ground," he said in an interview with Sky Sports. "Hopefully I will play for as long as I can. If I can get through until the end of the summer, that would be great. Ideally I don't want to miss any test matches. But I want to be able to bowl at 90 miles an hour and not 80 miles an hour. "That's something I have got to look at in the next three or four weeks. If I am still bowling at 80 miles an hour in the next week then we might have to have a look at it." Harmison has now retired from one-day internationals and hopes he can have the surgery while England play India in the one-day series in August, which is followed by the Twenty20 World Cup in South Afric
