 KARACHI, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced an annual budget of 2.4 billion rupees ($39.6 million) on Sunday to raise the standards of domestic and international cricket. There will also be a new central contractS system for national team players based on performances and not seniority. PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf told a news conference about 650 million rupees would be spent on development work. "We will spend around 80 million rupees on re-laying pitches and making them more sporting. Eventually the aim is to establish a firm and solid domestic structure which provides top talent to our national teams," he said. Pakistan is due to host the 2008 Champions Trophy and 14 matches of the 2011 World Cup and Ashraf said the test venues needed to be improved and upgraded. The board also announced a new central contracts system under which 20 players would be given contracts in three categories. Ashraf said the contracts would not simply be awarded on A seniority basis as in the past. "Now 40 percent of the criteria for giving contracts would be performances of players in last 12 years, 20 percent for seniority, 20 percent for fitness and 20 percent for discipline," he said. The radical steps come after Pakistan were eliminated in the first round of the World Cup after losing to Ireland. The competition level of domestic cricket has been held responsible or the inconsistent performances at the international level. Ashraf said the board would also help regional teams hire one overseas player a season. PCB communications director Ehsan Malik told Reuters that board officials had interviewed Australian Richard Done for the position of national coach. He said they would meet two other Australian candidates, Dav Whatmore and Geoff Lawson, for the position left vacant when Bob Woolmer died in Jamaica during the World Cup
