 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Zimbabwe Cricket has confirmed that India and Sri Lanka will tour the country for a ODI tri-series between May 28 and June 9 this year, reports Cricinfo. Each team plays the other twice before the final at the Harare Sports Club. India will stay back for two Twenty20 matches at the same venue on June 12 and 13. The announcement follows the postponement of New Zealand's tour of the country over security issues. The tri-series kicks off with the home side taking on India at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, which will host the first three games. India last toured the country in 2005 for two Tests and a tri-series, also involving New Zealand. Sri Lanka last toured Zimbabwe in November 2008, sweeping the five-match ODI series. India are also likely to tour Sri Lanka in July and August for a proposed Test series and a tri-series involving New Zealand. The respective cricket boards are yet to finalise a schedule.
