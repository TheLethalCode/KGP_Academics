 Sylhet, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com) - India's Border Security Force expressed "regrets" at a flag meeting with Bangladesh Rifles on Monday over the shooting of at least 13 Bangladeshi civilians the day before at the Jaintapur border in Sylhet. The Indian border guards, who intruded into Bangladesh territory on Sunday and then engaged BDR in a two-hour shoot out with civilians in the line of fire, promised that this type of action would not take place again. BSF has made a series of similar excursions in recent weeks to escort Indian fishermen into Bangladesh to fish at a water body called Dibir Haor which the Indians claim as theirs. The BDR director general visited the Jaintapur border following the shooting. The local BDR battalion chief requested a battalion commander-level flag meeting following the incident, the second such meeting in 72 hours. "Both the sides agreed to resolve the issue over Dibir Haor at a high-level meeting," Lt Col Khandaker Zahirul Alam, Commanding Officer of 21st Rifles Battalion, said after the meeting at Tamabil International Check Post on Monday. BSF Battalion 1 Commander Shekhar Gupta led the Indian side in the two-hour meeting from 4:30 p.m. The two commanders last met in a similar flag meeting on Saturday at the Padua-Protappur border after BSF intruded 100 yards inside Bangladesh at Padua in Sylhet and dug 15-20 bunkers before being forced to retreat. The latest BSF intrusions and shooting of civilians took place just days after director general-level talks concluded between the two border forces on March 11 in New Delhi, in which both sides had vowed greater cooperation. India's Border Security Force gave its assurance they would exercise restraint to prevent loss of innocent lives at the shared borders. 'GOVT ADDRESSING BSF ACTIONS' Home minister Sahara Khatun, meanwhile, told parliament on Monday that the government is addressing the shooting and killing of innocent Bangladeshis by the BSF. Replying to a question from independent MP Fazlul Azim, the minister said diplomatic initiatives were on to reach a permanent solution. A total of 14 Bangladeshis have been killed by the BSF this year so far, she said. "The government has been trying its utmost to resolve the problem. We want to a permanent solution," the minister said. Sahara said prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her Delhi trip in January discussed BSF killings with her Indian counterpart seeking a halt to civilian deaths. 'BDR FORCED TO FIRE BACK' Bangladesh Rifles chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam also spoke on the issue on Monday. He told a press briefing at the BDR's Dhaka HQ that Bangladesh border guards fired their weapons on Sunday only because they were compelled to do so in retaliation to BSF fire. The chief also briefed the media at the BDR headquarters on the recent director general-level talks between BDR and BSF in India. He said the New Delhi talks mainly focused on the killing of innocent Bangladeshis, land disputes on the border and cross-border crime. "In a democratic country, a law-enforcing agency cannot just fire and kill any suspect. If someone infringes, they can be detained and brought to justice. But shooting someone dead is unacceptable," Islam said. He said BDR arrested many Indians last year, but killed none of them. "Most of them were handed over to BSF, while the others were sent into police custody. The BSF was asked to follow this example," Mainul said. On the ownership of the disputed land in the border areas, such as the Dibir Haor, the BDR chief said during the prime minister' visit to India, the two countries agreed to resolve the problem by forming a joint boundary working group, which is likely to meet in April. bdnews24
