 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) Two more cases were filed against opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque in Sylhet and Feni for his recent allegations against the prime minister's son. On Monday, Farroque had been sued in Shariatpur and Chittagong for the same reason. The cases were filed by pro-government activists. Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, former education affairs secretary of Sylhet district Awami League filed a criminal case with the Chief Judiciary Magistrate's Court against the opposition chief whip. "I have filed the case to ensure that nobody can indulge in such false propaganda in future. Hopefully we will get justice," Nadel said. He has been asked to appear before the court on Apr 15. Another case was filed by Feni district Chhatra League general secretary Susen Sheel with the Additional Chief Judiciary Magistrate's Court. Sheel said the image of the prime minister has been tarnished by the false propaganda about her son. On Mar 12, Farroque claimed in a news conference in Dhaka that the PM's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wajed controlled the illegal VoIP trade from Canada and the USA. The business started during the last Awami League government's 1996-2001 tenure. bd
