 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)The country had a surplus budget of Tk 9.46 billion in the July-December period of the current fiscal year, the finance minister said Tuesday, indicating the government's better performance in revenue collection. Presenting the first ever six month budget implementation progress report in parliament, AMA Muhith also hinted that the revised budget would be reduced by about Tk 33 billion (Tk 3,296 crore). According to his presentation, the government fell short of its projected expenditure by about 40 percent, and revenue collection was off the mark by just about 5 percent for the first six months. Muhith also gave the broad details of budget implementation and the economy's challenges ahead. He also reiterated that the country would have a growth rate of 6 percent in this fiscal year. Revenue collection stood at Tk 355.53 billion in six months against an annual target of Tk 794.61 billion. Expenditure was Tk 346.07 billion against the newly revised target of Tk 1,105 billion. This perhaps led to another rare instance of the country earning more than it spent, with a tiny surplus of Tk 9.46 billion after two quarters. Muhith hinted that the Tk 1,138 billion budget may be slashed by just about 3 percent. He said that the government's challenges included infrastructure improvement, especially power and communications, raising investment and utilisation of foreign aid. The minister told the house that the Power Division could not complete required formalities of floating tenders for power projects since July 2009. According to him, duty from import was gradually declining while direct tax was increasing. Muhith, however, said direct tax was about 25 percent of the total revenue, which needed to be raised. "Inflation is showing an upward trend due to various factors including price hike in the international market and robust inflow of remittance." Inflation reached 8.5 percent in December and the government has taken a number of measures, said the finance minister. Exports earned $7.274 billion in six months (July-December) which was 6.2 percent less than that of the same period of the last year. "Orders for readymade garment sector have started picking up and we hope that the situation will improve in the coming months," said Muhith. The government has earmarked Tk 18 billion (Tk 1,800 crore) for cash incentives and subsidy of which the government disbursed half in the last six months. "It is an encouraging sign that LC opening for capital machinery increased by 37.4 percent in the period (six months)". The minister said remittance was a major driving force of the economy and 2,24,000 people went abroad and the wage earners remitted $5.536 billion in the six months. The country had over $10 billion foreign exchange reserve, which was enough to meet import payments of six months, the minister said. On December 30, 2008 the reserve was $5.788 billion. The minister said Bangladesh Bank had adopted pro-growth monetary policy and money supply increased by 20.7 percent in July-December, which was 19.2 per cent in the previous fiscal. Domestic lending increased by 13.7 percent, dropping from the previous year's 16 percent, he said. Credit flow to the private sector increased to 19.2 percent, which was 14.6 percent in the last fiscal's first six months. The government has attached maximum importance to agriculture and in the first six months farm loans worth Tk 55.98 billion were disbursed against a target of Tk 115.12 billion. "The regulations have been relaxed to make the agriculture loans easily available for the genuine farmers at their doorsteps," said Muhith.
