 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) - Despite Junaid Siddique's maiden century, Bangladesh suffered a 181-run loss on the fifth day of the first Test against England at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Tuesday. The target of 513 runs proved to be too much for Bangladesh and their second innings folded on 331 on the final afternoon. The result gave England a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series. For more than two sessions the hosts who began the day on 191-5, with Junaid batting on 68 and Mushfiqur Rahim (47 n.o), frustrated the tourists. The left-handed Junaid reached his first Test hundred with two boundaries in an over off paceman Steven Finn, the second a perfect straight drive from his 262nd delivery. Having negotiated the new ball, the sixth wicket pair, who came together with the score on 110-5 around 20 minutes before tea on the fourth day, were looking extremely comfortable until man of the match Graeme Swann struck. The spinner found the edge of Siddique's bat and carried low to Paul Collingwood at slip. Junaid faced 292 balls and hammered 17 fours. It ended a brilliant 167-run stand between the pair. Once Junaid departed for 106, Rahim soon followed when he charged down the wicket to a Swann delivery but missed the line and was bowled for 95. The wicketkeeper-batsman, who also scored fifty in the first innings, struck 12 fours in his 232-ball vigil. It was only a matter of time before the game was over as the rest of the batsmen offered little or no resistance. The only exception being Naeem Islam who scored an entertaining cameo 45-ball 36, which included three sixes and as many fours, before he was the last man to get out. Swann completed a maiden 10-wicket haul as he finished the second innings with figures of 5-127 and was named man of the match after his overall 10-217 performance. He was well supported by Tim Bresnan who took 3 for 63. The second Test starts at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Saturday.
