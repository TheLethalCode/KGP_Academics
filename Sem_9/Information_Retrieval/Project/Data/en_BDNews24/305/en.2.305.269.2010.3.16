<TITLE> Muhith wants capital market 'reorganised' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith on Tuesday said that a "handful of people" were controlling the capital market which needed an overhaul to curb their monopoly. "Investors, brokers and traders should be separated", the minister said. He, however, did not elaborate on how they should be "separated" or when the capital market will be reorganised. Muhith made the remarks during talks with journalists at the Economics Relations Department. "A few people are controlling the capital market and it needs complete reorganisation," the minister said. He also said that changes should be made in the trading system. The SEC on Monday raised the margin loan facilities to 1:1.5. Since the last SEC directive on margin loans in early February, traders could borrow up to a maximum ratio of 1:1, or an amount equivalent to the value of shares owned. The stock market regulator has in the recent months repeatedly changed its policy on the ceiling for margin loans, ostensibly to cool the overheated market. On December 12 last year, the SEC prohibited margin loan facilities altogether for what it termed "overvalued" shares - those with a price earning (PE) ratio above 75 points, to try and rationalise their prices. A PE ratio is a company's current share price compared to its earnings per share. The higher the PE ratio the more likely the share price is overvalued. Then again on February 1 this year, the market regulator extended the bar on margin loans for purchase of shares with a PE ratio over 50 points. Also on that date, it reduced the ceiling on margin loans from 1:2 to 1:1.5. Two days later on February 3, the ratio was further lowered to 1:1.
