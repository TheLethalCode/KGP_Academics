 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)The nation is observing on Wednesday the 90th birth anniversary of Bangladesh's founding father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with different programmes. The day is observed as National Children Day. All educational institutions across the country are observing the day. The government has declared public holiday to mark the day. Sheikh Mujib's daughter prime minister Sheikh Hasina, along with her cabinet members and Awami League party colleagues, laid floral tributes at her father's portrait at the Bangabandhu Museum in the morning. Hasina extracted from the holy Quran for some time there. Sheikh Mujib was born on this day at Tungipara in Gopalganj in 1920. He was the third among six children of Sheikh Lutfar Rahman and Saima Begum. He turned into a natural leader and called the Bengalees to a bloody struggle for freedom from oppressive Pakistani rulers. Later he became the first president of the independent Bangladesh. President Md Zillur Rahman and the prime minister later went to Tungipara at around 10am and laid wreaths at the Mujib's grave and offered special prayers. Hasina inaugurated a children's rally, a book fair and a cultural programme at Tungipara in Gopalganj. The pro-government Swadhinata Chikitshak Parishad, a forum of doctors, also initiated a free health service programme for the destitute. While inaugurating the children assembly, Hasina said, "Bangabandhu's death was an irreparable loss to the nation. Bangladesh lost the leader who could take the country a long way forward." She also said his birthday is observed as the National Children Day as he used to love children a lot. Hasina vowed to build Bangladesh a country of gold and free of child torture and child trafficking. The prime minister also launched a commemorative postage stamp. Ruling Awami League started the day with hoisting national and party flags at the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. The party will hold a discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium in Dhaka later in the day. bdne
