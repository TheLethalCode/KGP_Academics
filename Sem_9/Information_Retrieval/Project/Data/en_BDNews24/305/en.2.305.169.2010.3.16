<TEXT>
 Chittagong, March 16 (bdnews24.com) - No miracles happened, and the loss was inevitable. Despite Junaid Siddique's maiden century, Bangladesh suffered a 181 run loss. The target of 513 runs proved to be too much for Bangladesh and their second innings stopped at 331 runs on the fifth day. In their first innings, England declared after scoring 599 runs for 6 wickets. Bangladesh failed to avoid the follow-on being bowled out for only 296. However, rather than imposing the follow-on, the English batted once again scoring 209 for 7 wickets before declaring for the second time. Bangladesh started the fifth day in Chittagong with 191 runs on the board and 5 wickets in hand. They ruled the first session as the English bowlers failed to topple any of their wickets. The overnight not-out batsman Junaid Siddique continued his innings of 68 runs and stopped at 106. It took him 262 balls to reach the landmark. He faced 292 balls, hitting 17 fours before Swann got his wicket, courtesy of a great catch by Paul Collingwood. The other not-out batsman Mushfiqur Rahim played a good supporting role as he managed to achive his 7th Test fifty. He started with 47 runs from the previous day, and was well in the way for his second Test hundred until Swann got him clean bowled at 95. Before the fall of these two wickets Bangladesh entered the lunch break with 277 runs on the board, without losing anymore wickets on the last day. Following the break, it seemed like the Cricket-God turned his back to Bangladesh with wicket tumbling randomly. Junaid's batting ceased just after the break without adding any number to the total. Rahim was next to go at 294. After that the loss was only a matter of time as the next batsmen came in and went out of the field without taking a stand. Naeem Islam was the only one to try and force his way through the innings scoring 36 and was the last man to get out. Among the English bowlers Swann took 5 wickets for 127 runs, while Bresnan took 3 for 63. Swann was awarded the Man of the Match as he took 5 wickets in each innings. By winning this Test, England now leads the two match series 1-0. The second Test will start in Dhaka, at the Sher-E-Bbangla National Cricket Stadium from 20th March. b
