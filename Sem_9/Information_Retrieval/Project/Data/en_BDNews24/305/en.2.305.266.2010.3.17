 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen left Wednesday for Delhi to hold the long-overdue Joint Rivers Commission meeting on sharing of the Teesta water with his Indian counterpart. The two-day meeting begins tomorrow. The ministerial-level meeting is taking place after a pause of nearly five years since the last Dhaka meeting in September 2005. According to the JRC's charter, the two countries should sit every year to talk water-related issues and settle all disputes on the 54 common rivers that enter Bangladesh from India. "The minister along with 15 other delegation members left at around 8am by an Indian Airlines flight," an officer at the airport immigration told bdnews24.com Wednesday. According to Water resources ministry sources, Bangladesh and India will sit primarily to settle the issue about how much water the two countries would share from the Teesta river. "We hope that the two countries at the meeting will reach an agreement on the Teesta's sharing," Shaikh Md Wahid-uz-Zaman, water resources secretary, told bdnews24.com Tuesday at his office. Zaman, one of the leading members of the Bangladesh delegation, said the Indian side was interested in the Teesta deal too. Experts say, Islambad and Delhi started talks on the Teesta sharing in the early 1950s when Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan, but no progress was made. Dhaka and Delhi discussed the Teesta sharing since 1972 after Bangladesh's emergence as an independent nation in 1971. The discussion is still going on. The Teesta is considered very important for Bangladesh's food security. Water development board sources say, over 750,000 hectares of farm land in the food surplus Rangpur region is dependent on the river for supplementary irrigation. The government has the largest supplementary irrigation in the dry season (Nov to April) at Dalia in Rangpur over the Teesta. The board sources say, the flow of water comes down drastically and the farmers in the drought-prone region don't get enough water for growing rice, Bangladesh's main staple. Foreign minister Dipu Moni last month told media that the government would be able to reach an ad hoc deal on the Teesta's sharing. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her last Delhi tour discussed the issue with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh. Bangladesh-India joint statement on Hasina's visit has stressed expediting the negotiation with a view to signing an agreement on the Teesta
