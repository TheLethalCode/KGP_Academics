<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  The US government is investigating whether there are any links between Pakistan-based militant outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba and opposition party Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Tuesday after returning from a weeklong tour. "Many suspects who have been arrested in recent months for militant activities in Bangladesh have disclosed information including their sources of finance, how they operate here and so on," the minister said. Bangladesh police arrested at least four suspected LeT operatives last year, in Chittagong and Dhaka, who the law enforcers alleged were plotting to attack the Indian and US embassies here. At least one of the suspects, arrested in Dhaka, was also alleged to be a recruiter for LeT in Bangladesh, police said. LeT, founded in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir, is blamed for the Mumbai attacks in November 2008 that killed 166 people. It is also blamed for the late 2001 attack on Indian parliament. It was banned in Pakistan in 2002. "The US is investigating any relation between the Pakistan-based Islamic militant outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami," Shafique said on Tuesday. The law minister also added that the US would provide Bangladesh with intelligence information along with logistic support in the fight against militancy and terrorism. The US will train RAB and police to eliminate militant activities, he said. "In particular, they will share enformation on how to prevent militant finances coming from abroad and on thwarting operations of cross-border militant networks," he said. US lawmakers just last week urged the Obama administration to focus more attention on Lashkar-e-Taiba militants and push Islamabad harder to rein in the Pakistan-based group blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks. bd
