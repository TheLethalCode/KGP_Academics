<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)The border guards might be ordered to fire at anybody to stop smuggling across the border, Bangladesh Rifles chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam said on Monday. He also said that the BDR fired on Sunday only because they were compelled to do so by the India's Border Security Force. The chief briefed the media at the BDR headquarters on the recent director general-level talks between BDR and BSF in India. He said the New Delhi talks mainly focused on the killing of innocent Bangladeshis, land dispute and cross-border illegal trade. "In a democratic country, a law-enforcing agency cannot just fire and kill any criminals. If someone infringes, they can be detained and brought to justice. But shooting someone dead is unacceptable," Islam said. BDR arrested many Indians last year, but killed none of them. Most of them were turned in to BSF, while the others were sent to police custody. The BSF was asked to follow this instance, Mainul said. "BDR has been asked to show zero tolerance towards drug smuggling. They will be authorised to shoot if necessary." On the ownership of the disputed land across the border, the BDR chief said during the prime minister' visit to India, the two countries agreed to resolve the problem by forming a joint boundary working group, which is likely to meet in April. bd
