<TITLE> Minister terms strike 'illegal' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Shipping minister Shajahan Khan described the indefinite strike by the launch workers as "illegal" and a "violation of labour laws", but the workers federation that called the strike rejected the allegation. The minister made the comments to journalists at the ministry on Tuesday as the Water Vessel Workers Federation went on strike from Monday midnight. He also said that the federation did not give the government sufficient time to try and resolve it "as is required by law", adding "it is perhaps intended to embarrass the government". The striking vessel workers, however, refuted the minister's allegations, saying, they were compelled to go on strike after a "tripartite agreement", between the government, launch owners and workers, was not implemented in the past four and a half months. "Despite repeated reminders, the government didn't take any initiative to implement the agreement", said, Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, general secretary of the launch workers federation. Khan said that the strike could not be blamed on the government. It was the government who had managed to get the launch owners and workers to sit together, and tried to persuade the workers to continue discussions for two more days, he said. "The Water Vessel Workers Federation is not a trade union, so legally they have no right to bargain," the shipping minister claimed. "It cannot even call a strike. But still the government is trying to solve their logical demands. We hope that they will settle differences by sitting with the owners." The workers had put forward a 22-point demand including the formulation of a minimum wage, a proper salary structure and issue of appointment letters. Referring to the 22-point demand, the minister said, "Steps have already been taken to meet a number of their demands. The government is working on dredging the rivers, removing illegal establishments from river territories, constructing embankments, and protecting the environment." But the main problems, he said, are the issues of pay scale and stopping river piracy. The government has ordered the coast guard to be more alert about stopping river piracy. It has also taken the initiative to form a river-police force, though he said that this will take time. On the issue of salary structure the minister said, "It is the matter for the labour ministry. However the government can fix a salary structure if it considered it necessary. But such a structure has to be agreed by both owners and workers as they will be the parties who have to follow it." "It is therefore imperative for the two parties to sit together. It will also take time. The problem won't be solved in a day. It will take at least a month. But, if they give us a structure we can issue a gazette notification." The shipping minister also revealed that, to relieve the situation of passengers, government vessels have been ordered to carry members of the public whilst the strike continues.
