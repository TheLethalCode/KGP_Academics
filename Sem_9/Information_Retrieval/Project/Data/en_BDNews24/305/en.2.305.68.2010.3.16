<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's popularity has hit a record low over his radical health and climate policies, but his government would still win elections expected this year, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday. Rudd's Labor party remains ahead of the conservative opposition, 52 percent to 48, on a two-party basis in the closely watched Newspoll published in the Australian newspaper. But only 48 percent of respondents were satisfied with Rudd's performance as he struggled to find backing for radical health reform plans and to deal with the fallout from a bungled home-insulation plan that led to several deaths. "The key thing that Australian working families expect of me is to keep my sleeves rolled up and delivering on the basics," Rudd told state radio.

It was the first time Rudd's satisfaction rating has dipped below 50 percent since his 2007 election victory, and was well off a 2008 high of 71 percent. Satisfaction with Rudd has dropped 19 points since September last year. Rudd will likely call an election in the second half of 2010 and is tipped to govern for another three years. His plans to cut carbon emissions, so far thwarted by parliament, could make waves in stock and electricity markets if implemented in a second term.

I think that people are starting to see the inner bully in Mr Rudd," Abbott said. Abbott still trails Rudd by a wide margin, but his popularity is the highest for an opposition leader since the 2007 election loss, which led to infighting and several leadership switches. On the primary vote, opposition support was stable on 41 percent, with the government losing a point to 39 percent and support shifting to minor party Greens. Many primary votes cast for losing Green candidates are redistributed to Labor candidates, according to voters' instructions on ballot papers. Rudd's Labor won in 2007 with 52.7 percent of the vote against 47.3 for the conservativ
