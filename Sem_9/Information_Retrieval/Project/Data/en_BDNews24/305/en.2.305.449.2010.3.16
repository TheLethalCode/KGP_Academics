 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief Gen. Md. Abdul Mubeen on Tuesday visited the headquarters of the Indian Army's 14 Corps in Leh in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The 14 Corps of the Indian Army was raised after the India-Pakistan confrontation in 1999 commonly known as Kargil War. It is entrusted with the responsibility of the Indian Army's operations in the strategically important Ladakh region and guards India's Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan. Gen. Mubeen is currently on a visit to India. He is one of the few chiefs of foreign countries' armed forces to be hosted by the Indian Army in its strategically located 14 Corps headquarters. However, due to inclement weather, Gen. Mubeen could not fly to the Indian Army's forward base at Siachen Glacier as planned. At an altitude of 21000 feet above the Mean Sea Level, the Siachen Glacier on the Karakoram Range of the Himalayas borders Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was once known the highest battlefield on earth until India and its western neighbour entered into a ceasefire in November 2003. Gen. Mubeen was the first Army chief of Bangladesh to be invited to visit the Indian Army's forward base in Siachen Glacier. In October 2008, the US Army Chief General George W Casey had travelled to the glacier as a guest of the Indian Army and interacted with the soldiers camping there. A press release issued by the India's Ministry of Defence said Gen Mubeen during his visit to Leh praised the Indian Army soldiers for carrying out their tasks with lan while braving the extreme weather conditions and difficult terrain in the icy heights of the Himalayas. The General Officer Commanding of the 14 Corps, Lt. Gen. S K Singh, and other officials welcomed Gen. Mubeen on his arrival in Leh. Lt. Gen. Singh briefed Gen. Mubeen about the high altitude conditions that the Indian Army soldiers have to experience in the area while guarding both the LAC and LoC as well as the Siachen Glacier. "The visiting Bangladesh Army chief was briefed by Lt. Gen. Singh on various commitments of the Indian Army, peculiarities involved with operations in the high altitude terrain of the Himalayas and various developmental projects undertaken in the remote region of Ladakh in the Jammu and Kashmir state," Indian Army spokesman Lt. Col. Biplab Nath said. Gen. Mubeen also visited the Shanti Stupa in Leh. The Shanti Stupa, located on a hilltop, was constructed by a Japanese Buddhist organization and it reflects the region's Buddhist culture and religion. The Army chief interacted with the abbot and other priests of the shrine. "[The Bangladesh army chief's] visit to Leh has played a significant role in promoting and strengthening the bonds of friendship, mutual trust and confidence between the armies of India and Bangladesh and between the two countries," Lt. Col. Nath added. Gen. Mubeen reached New Delhi last Sunday for a five-day tour on the invitation of his Indian counterpart Gen. Deepak Kapoor. It is his first visit to India after taking over as the chief of the Bangladesh Army last year. He is accompanied by his wife and four officers of the Bangladesh Army.
