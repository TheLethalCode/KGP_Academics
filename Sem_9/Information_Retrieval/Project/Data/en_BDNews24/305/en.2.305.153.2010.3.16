<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com) - Passenger launches countrywide were at a standstill on Tuesday as workers called an indefinite strike following the collapse of talks to resolve their long-standing demands for better working conditions. The Water Vessel Workers Federation imposed the strike from Monday midnight after the tripartite talks involving the government, launch owners and employees ended without agreement. The workers had put forward a 22-point demand including the formulation of a minimum wage, a proper salary structure and issue of appointment letters. No launch departed from the capital's Sadarghat terminal from Tuesday morning. Shipping traffic inspector Md Masud told bdnews24.com that 12 launches had been scheduled to leave for southern routes; none of them had left the terminal. Some 39 launches, coming from the south, were now anchored off the pier having offloaded their passengers, he added. Passengers were seen to be leaving Sadarghat terminal on realising that there were no launch departures. Md Nazrul Islam, who had come to the terminal that morning from Mirpur, told bdnews24.com that he was supposed to travel urgently to Shariatpur, but now had to return home due to the strike. Housewife Shahnaz also said that she was unable to get to Chandpur to see her sick father. Malek, a launch master, and member of the union, told bdnews24.com that the workers would continue their strike until at least some some of their 22-point demands were met. Pleas from shipping minister Shajahan Khan and secretary Abdul Mannan Howladar for the launch workers to resolve their problems with owners through discussions were turned down Sunday by workers' representatives. bd
