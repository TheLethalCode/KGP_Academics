 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com) - It doesn't take much to counterfeit cash these days - a computer, a printer and a chain of distributors - according to a group of forgers arrested in the capital. Mehdi Hassan Babu (35), a graphic art graduate, showed journalists exactly how at Jatrabari police station on Monday. Babu, along with Abdur Rahim (48) and his wife Rabeya Akhter Shati (23) were arrested from a Jatrabari apartment on Sunday night. The three were allegedly running a money counterfeiting operation from the flat. Police said they recovered counterfeit Bangladeshi currency with a face value of Tk 303,300 and Tk 54,200 worth of fake Indian rupees from the flat along with counterfeiting equipment and computers. Jatrabari police chief Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com that the gang has been operating for a very long time. "We now have information on other members of the gang and are trying to track them too. Part of the gang also operates in India," Moniruzzaman said. "The gang prints rupees in Bangladesh and takes them to India. They also print Bangladesh currency in India and bring it here," the police officer said. In the counterfeiting demonstration at the police station, meanwhile, Babu printed out Tk 500 notes and said that with use of additional chemicals they could be made to look even more real. "First we remove the dye from Tk 100 notes by boiling them, and then we print Tk 500 notes onto the bare currency paper," said Babu. He told bdnews24.com that he had joined the counterfeit gang a month ago. Rahim said he used to deliver the money printed by Babu to an address in Motijheel. For this, he said, he was paid Tk 20,000 and was provided living quarters. He also said that the flat was owned by a man called Zakir Hossain. bdnews
