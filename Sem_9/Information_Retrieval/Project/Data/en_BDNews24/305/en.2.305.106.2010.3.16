 MADRID, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jurado scored with a superb curling shot to grab a 1-0 win for 10-man Atletico Madrid at home to Osasuna in La Liga on Monday. The King's Cup finalists had Portugal winger Simao Sabrosa sent off for a second-bookable offence after 57 minutes of a match short on quality and sights of goal, but the visitors failed to capitalise. Midfielder Jurado found the top corner from the edge of the area 11 minutes from time, to leave Atletico 10th in the standings on 34 points, 10 short of the Champions League qualification places. Real Madrid top La Liga on goal difference from Barcelona after both sides won at the weekend to stay neck-and-neck on 65 points. A Gonzalo Higuain hat-trick fired Real to a 4-1 victory away to Real Valladolid on Sunday, when Argentina team mate Lionel Messi also bagged a hat-trick in Barca's 3-0 home win over the leaders' closest challenger Valencia. Defeat at the Nou Camp left Valencia a distant 18 points off the pace in third
