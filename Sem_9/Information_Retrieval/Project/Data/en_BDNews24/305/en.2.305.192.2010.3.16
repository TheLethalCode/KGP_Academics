<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Eighteen internet-service providers (ISPs) launched IP telephony services in Dhaka on Tuesday. This is the first time in Bangladesh a large number of companies will provide this service. "This service is available to anyone through mobile or computer with an internet connection," said Sumon Ahmed, managing director of Bdcom Online. "With IP telephone it is possible to make calls at lowest possible rate from any corner of the country," he added. Monthly charge for the service is only Tk 100 and Tk 0.65 per minute from mobile. This rate is lower than those offered by mobile operators, according to Ahmed. He said national and international calls can be made at the same rate but added, for regulatory limitations, these phones cannot be used in abroad. Ahmed also asked telecoms regulator BTRC to bring down the call rate to Tk 0.30. "Almost one crore Bangladeshis live abroad and to make sure that they can benefit from the service, the government should ease the regulations." State minister for science and ICT Yafes Osman called for the ISPs to work for the benefit of people. He said, "The present government is providing all necessary support to science and technology sector to build digital Bangladesh." BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed said a parliamentary committee is working on how to make those running illegal business pay taxes. "Once ways to bring illegal VoIP operators under the revenue structure are devised, numbers of illegal business will come down with the enforcement of law." He added government clampdown on illegal VoIPs saw increased number of legal calls. "Until August 2009 number of legal calls were 63 crore and in February 2010 it has increased to 93 crore," said Ahmed. He said BTRC has deactivated 2.5 lakh mobile SIM cards and 15,000 IPs have been shut down for running illegal business. "There is more than 15,000 kilometres of fibre optics cable connection and we have reached 284 upazilas," he also added. Ahmed however admitted that the internet service is 'comparatively costlier' in Bangladesh than in other countries. b
