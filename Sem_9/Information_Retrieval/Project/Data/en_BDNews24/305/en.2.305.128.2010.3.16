 MANCHESTER, Mar 16 ( bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nani has promised Manchester United supporters there is much more to come from him after admitting he has done a lot of "growing up" this season. The mercurial Portuguese winger has struggled for consistency since his 17 million-pound ($25.78 million) move from Sporting Lisbon in 2007 and looked to have lost the faith of the Old Trafford fans earlier in the campaign. Nani appeared to be on his way out of the club after criticising manager Alex Ferguson during a barren run of just one appearance between early November and late January. But since grabbing two assists in a 4-0 win over Hull City in January, Nani has excelled, playing eight times and starting both legs as United breezed past AC Milan 7-2 on aggregate to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.

"I'm still learning all the time. I'm only 23 years old and I've still got time to learn things and to try and be an even better player. "Of course, I want to score more goals because it's important for me and the club. "But at the moment I'm happy with my contribution to the team. I have been involved in setting up a lot of goals. I know I make an important contribution." Nani hopes to show off his trademark somersault celebration at the World Cup this year where Portugal face Brazil, Ivory Coast and North Korea in the group stage in South Africa. "It's my first World Cup and I want to be there and help my team mates achieve something special for our country," Nani said. "I like to celebrate a goal with a somersault and if I score, why
