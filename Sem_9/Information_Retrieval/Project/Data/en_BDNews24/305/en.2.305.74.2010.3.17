<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Government is planning to build six road overpasses across rail-crossings in the capital to solve traffic congestion problems caused by long tailbacks as trains pass through the city centre. "The Roads and Highways Department will construct four overpasses at Syadabad, Jurain, Malibagh and FDC rail-crossings," communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told parliament on Tuesday. Another overpass will be built over Moghbazar crossing, with funds from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the army will build one at Banani rail-crossing," he said. "This should reduce traffic congestion in the city," the minister said. The measure should also prevent car and train collisions caused by impatient drivers ignoring on signals and getting caught on train tracks. At least two such accidents occurred last year at Maghbazar and Malibagh rail crossings. The minister added that the project proposal is underway and will be sent to ECNEC soon. 9 FOREIGN COS VIE FOR ELEVATED EX'WAY The government has received proposals from nine foreign companies to build an elevated expressway in the capital, Hossain said. "It is a tremendous response," he said. "We hope the project will get well underway during our tenure," he said. He also told parliament that the government has plans to build four-lane bridges over the Meghna and Gomoti rivers on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. The government is also thinking to connect Mongla and Chittagong port with a rail link, said the minister. Some 53 km of railway tracks would be required between Khulna and Mongla port, he said. The project could be completed in four years by the end of the present government's tenure, he added. Hossain also informed the parliament that the present government has not cancelled any work in the communication sector that was started by the past BNP-led government. BANGLADESH-CHINA RAIL TIES Hossain also told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that his ministry, ahead of the prime minister's visit to China, had estimated a two-part rail project to connect Bangladesh with China's Yunnan province via Myanmar would cost $210 million. The two parts are: Construction of a Single Line Metre Gauge Railway Track from Dohazari to Cox's Bazar via Ramu, and Ramu to Gundum near the Myanmar Border. "These are two priority projects. The prime minister will seek Chinese assistance to implement them," the minister said. bdn
