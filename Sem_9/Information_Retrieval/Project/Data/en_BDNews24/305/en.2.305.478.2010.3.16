 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com) - Launch workers went on strike from Monday midnight following the collapse of tripartite talks between the government, launch owners and employees to resolve ongoing worker demands for better working conditions. Pleas from shipping minister Shahjahan Khan and secretary Abdul Mannan Howladar for the launch workers to resolve their problems with owners through discussions were turned down by workers' representatives. The three-hour tripartite meeting chaired by minister Shahjahan Khan ended at 8 p.m. Water Vessel Workers Federation vice president Shah Alam and treasurer Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com that the meeting had failed. The government had sought to get the workers to continue discussion for a further two days but the workers refused. The workers had put forward a 22-point demand including the formulation of a minimum wage, a proper salary structure and issue of appointment letters. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority vice president Badiuzzaman Badal told bdnews24.com, "Nothing could be done in the meeting because of the obduracy of the labour representatives." "They sent a vice president instead of the president and the general secretary." Badal said that at the meeting the workers were promised a new wage structure and appointment letters in a month. "But the workers still did not agree and decided to carry out their strike." Shahidul Islam Bhuiyan, vice-president of the Motor Launch Owners Association, was also highly critical of the workers' union. He confirmed, however, that during what he termed the "illegal strike" called by the workers, the launch owners would not take any risks with members of the public by operating vessels without the workers. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan told bdnews24.com, "The problem involves owners and workers. They have to solve their own problems. The government cannot impose a solution. Both sides have to come to a consensus." But he described the conduct of the workers' leaders as "ill-motivated". He said the government has no plans to take any new initiative to resolve the dispute. b
