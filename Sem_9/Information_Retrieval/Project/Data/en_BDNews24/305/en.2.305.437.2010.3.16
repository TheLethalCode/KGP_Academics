 COLOMBO, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka appeared before a military court on Tuesday on charges of engaging in politics while in uniform, officials said, as thousands of his supporters protested in the capital. The court martial held at the navy headquarters in Colombo was adjourned until next month after lawyers for the army commander challenged the legitimacy of the court and opposed the choice of members of the military tribunal.

Protests after the arrest of Fonseka in February dragged down the island nation's share market but stocks have since recovered, even though foreign investors have been net sellers. On Tuesday share index fell over 1.5 percent to hit a near two-week low by 0816 GMT due to profit taking after it hit a fresh record high on Monday. Analysts said the market had shrugged off Fonseka's court martial. Fonseka and Rajapaksa worked together to end the war against the Tamil Tiger separatists last year but soon fell out. Fonseka lost by an 18 percentage point margin to Rajapaksa in the January poll, after which he accused the president of rigging the v
