 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)The government will make provision for punishment, if necessary, for dishonouring the national flag and national anthem, a senior minister told parliament on Tuesday. Agriculture minister Matiya Chowdhury made the government's policy statement Tuesday replying to an urgent notice served by Abul Kalam, an Awami League MP elected from Rangpur. "The National Anthem Rules and National Flag Rules contain the guidelines for honouring the national flag and anthem," said Matia Chowdhury, who very often answered to questions on establishment ministry in parliament. "But there is no stipulated punishment if the national anthem and flag are dishonoured," she said. The minister blamed some "political parties" and "anti-liberatione elements" of trying to undermine the flag and anthem. "The government will insert a section in the rules for flouting the national anthem and flag, if necessary," she said. Azad also asked the minister whether the government would ban the younger generation's practice of painting the national flag on cheeks and arms on different occasions. "This is nothing wrong with that. This is an expression of younger generation's love for their national anthem and flag," said Matia. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was chairing the session, urged the minister stopping the practice of playing national anthem in the cinema halls at the start of movies. "The viewers should stand up while national anthem is played. But in most of the cases they don't," said Hamid. The minister said, "They should be made aware that they should stand up to show respect to the national anthem".
