<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com)  The owner of the billboard that fell and killed two people at a Gulshan market during the storm on Monday night failed to obtain permission from the DCC to build the structure, officials say. Foyzur Rahman, who owned the market where the incident took place, had also recently ignored a number of DCC notices demanding that he remove the illegal billboard, Dhaka City Corporation's chief urban planner Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com. This was confirmed by Habibur Rahman Sarkar, the Secretary of the Shop Owners Association of the Gulshan Shopping Centre, where the billboard was illegally erected. He told bdnews24.com that Rahman had "defied several DCC notices against the billboard". "He continued to rent out the rooftop space, with Akhter Furnishers paying him a handsome amount," Sarkar said. Foyzur Rahman was reportedly "out of the country' and could not be reached for comment. As of Tuesday evening, no case has been filed by relatives' victims - though the Gulshan police chief said that they would file a criminal case if no one else does. The incident has again highlighted the dangerous situation of billboards in Dhaka city - and the lack of any proper regulation. THOUSANDS OF HAZARDOUS HOARDINGS According to Sirajul Islam, there are an estimated 2,500 illegal billboards and mega signs in the citythough DCC admits even they don't know the exact numbermany of which are in a hazardous situation. "Lethal accidents can occur anytime", he said. Islam said only about 300 existing billboards and 200 mega signs have been authorised by DCC engineers, as the city corporation regulations require, with the city receiving Tk 50-100 per square feet. All rooftop hoardings are illegal, he said, referring to a 2005 ban, though billboard owners have long been contesting the ban in court. "It is not just the private traders who violate DCC regulations, it is also government organisations," Islam added. The city official said that the DCC intends to conduct an eviction drive "soon" against illegal billboards in the capital. A meeting is to be held on March 23 at which advertising agencies and building owners will be invited to find a solution. However, Islam admitted that the "lack of DCC personnel and the absence of appropriate equipment means that we cannot remove more than five illegal billboards a day." The police and the shop owners association however don't accept DCC's excuses The chief of Gulshan Police Station Kamal Uddin said, "These two deaths were due to the neglect of DCC. If they had supervised billboard constructions properly or informed the police then this would not have happened." Kamal Uddin also said, "DCC has never asked us for our help in removing any billboards in our area. A case could also be filed against the DCC for their neglect that resulted in the deaths on Monday night." A teenage shop worker and a driver were killed as a sudden storm caused the 800 square foot billboard to crash down on at least four cars at the shopping centre at Gulshan-1 intersection. Last month billboards at Bijoy Sarani and Dhanmondi fell, causing injuries. In 2009, one person was killed and three injured as a hoarding fell on a phone booth at Zia International Airport. Rafiqul Islam, general manager of Neptune Advertising and president of the Outdoor Advertisement Owners Association, admitted that his association members have taken "no steps" to compensate the victims from billboard collapses. "All members of the association should be take more notice of the issue," he said. He also claimed there was a conflict between city planning authority Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) and DCC over the issue. "We are also insisting on a fast decision about these billboards," said the ad industry leader Meanwhile, the last major drive by DCC and RAJUK to remove banned rooftop hoardings was halted in 2007 by a High Court stay order. The High Court asked the city authorities not to pull down any hoarding till disposal of a petition challenging the ban by none other than the Outdoor Advertisement Owners Association. bdnews24.c
