 JOHANNESBURG, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have recalled captain Graeme Smith to their one-day squad for the tour of West Indies in May and June. Smith will return after missing last month's 2-1 one-day series defeat in India because of a finger injury, Cricket South Africa said on Tuesday. All-rounder Ryan McLaren was also brought back while Herschelle Gibbs and Albie Morkel were dropped. For the Tests, the selectors picked the same 15-man squad that drew the two-match series against India 1-1. "Our aim at the moment is to build formidable squads both for the World Twenty20 (in April and May) as well as for the World Cup next year," coach Corrie van Zyl said in a statement. "An important part of this is to achieve consistency on the field and an important contribution to that will be to be consistent in the selection process as well." South Africa are due to play three Tests and five one-day internationals against West Indies. Test squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Petersen, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.
