 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com)  Apparel industry leaders have demanded steady supply of power and gas to ensure uninterrupted production in the country's largest export sector. They say the power and gas crises have hampered production at a number from factories in Dhaka and Chittagong. Leaders of Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters' Association met with the prime minister's energy advisor Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury and state minister for power Enamul Huq at the secretariat on Tuesday. "The situation in ready-made garments industry is not good because of the prevailing gas and power crisis. There is no substitute of steady power and gas supply in saving this labour-oriented industry. The supply has to be ensured giving top priority to the industry," BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy told reporters after the meeting. He also demanded subsidy on diesel and furnace fuel prices. Murshedy continued, "If the government fails to provide steady supply of power and gas, then they will have to temporarily stay the raise in prices. Also the separate rates of peak and off-peak hours will have to be dissolved into a steady flat rate." He also demanded a halt in the current drive to cut power and gas connection of companies that failed to pay arrear bills. The BGMEA president said that production delays due to interruption in power and gas supply has compelled them to send cargo by air instead of sea, causing huge economic loss to the exporters. The cost of transporting cargo by air is approximately 110 times more. "The ready-made garments sector is going through a hard time currently. Exports have gone down by 7 percent compared to last year. Income in the period from Jul-Jan of this fiscal year is $3,152.92 million. It was $3,759.28 in the previous year", Murshedy said. The prime minister's energy advisor and the state minister for power assured to take steps, the BGMEA president said. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association also sought the prime minister's intervention to get over the ongoing gas and power crisis. The country's main export sector was running a high risk due to inadequate supply of gas and power, a statement signed by BKMEA president Fazlul Haque said. The crises have halted regular production at a number of export-oriented factories in Dhaka, Chittagong, Gazipur, Savar and Narayanganj. "We fail to gain 50 percent target of daily production due to the crises. Sometimes export orders are cancelled," he said. The export target in the knitwear sector for current fiscal has been set at $7297.21 billion. If the situation continues it will be impossible to fulfil the target. "We believe the prime minister's prompt initiative will safeguard the knitwear sector and it will be able to play a positive role in the country's economy," Haque said. bdn
