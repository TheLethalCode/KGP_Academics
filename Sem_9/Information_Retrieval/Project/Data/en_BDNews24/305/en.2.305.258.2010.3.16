<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court on Tuesday rejected a police submission to take into custody three top executives of the private land phone operator Dhaka Phone in connection with an illegal VoIP case. The court instead asked the police to question the three men at the jail gate. Metropolitan magistrate Syeda Minhaj-um-Munira also refused bail applications brought by each of the three men - the director general (engineering) Harun-al-Atahar, senior manager (engineering) Ikramuzzaman and the manager (billing) Hari Podder. The three officials - along with two other company employees - had been sent to jail on Monday night. They were all arrested on Sunday following evidence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations at the Dhaka Phone's Mahakhali office. A case had been filed on December 24 last year with Badda Police Station against the Dhaka Phone officials for the illegal connection of foreign calls. Banned equipment was also seized at that time. The BTRC allege that although the company officials were warned at that time, they have again started operating illegal VoIP services. The five detainees were shown arrested in connection with last year's case. bdne
