 Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush on Friday laid out a detailed request for $70 billion to partially fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while providing more aid to tackle an unfolding global food crisis. The president's request for the fiscal year starting October 1, originally made in February, includes $45.1 billion for combat operations for the two wars, $3.7 billion to help expand the Afghan forces and $2 billion for Iraqi troops. "This request represents urgent and essential requirements," Bush said in a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congress is expected to provide the money. But Democrats, who have been pushing for a timetable to withdraw most of the 159,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, are considering attaching conditions that Bush may find objectionable. If Congress approves the additional money for this year and next, it will bring the total allocation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to over $800 billion. The House could debate Bush's request next week. Most of the money would be used to fund the wars after October 1 and into next year, when a new president will be in office. Congress is likely to couple this bill with Bush's $108 billion request for the current fiscal year to cover additional war spending and related matters. One initiative Democrats are considering attaching to the funding bill is expanding educational benefits for veterans. The Bush administration is opposed, saying the initiative could encourage active duty soldiers to leave the military at a time when forces are stretched thin. Bush also urged Congress to approve $350 million for Middle East peace efforts, including $200 million for the Palestinians on condition that no money goes to the militant group Hamas which refuses to accept Israel's right to exist. After years of inactivity on the Arab-Israeli peace front, Bush launched a new initiative last year with a Middle East conference in Annapolis, Maryland. SCANT MIDEAST HOPE He said at the time he aimed to secure a peace treaty and the creation of a Palestinian state before leaving office next January -- but there has been little sign he can succeed. Bush will travel to Israel in mid-May to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Jewish state. While there, he will try to jumpstart the faltering peace process. The budget request also includes $770 million in additional food aid donations that Bush unveiled on Thursday, including food vouchers, seeds and purchases in the developing world. Additional requests include: $2.2 billion for projected increased fuel costs for military and intelligence operations. $2.6 billion to transport and maintain Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAP) used for U.S. forces in Iraq. $193.2 million in military and economic aid to Pakistan and to boost diplomatic activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and expand U.S. development operations there. $35.6 million for increased diplomatic security for Middle East peace missions as well as personnel in Sudan and Somalia. $15 million to help push forward the six-party talks focused on getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
