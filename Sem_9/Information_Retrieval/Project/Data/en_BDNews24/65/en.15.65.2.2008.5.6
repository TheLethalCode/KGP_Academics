 LONDON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mobile phone group Vodafone scored its first deal to sell Apple Inc's iPhone after the UK group lost out to Telefonica's O2 to sell it in Britain. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company by revenue, has been competing with operators and retailers to secure the right to sell the iPhone - the touch-screen device which combines Apple's popular iPod music player, a video player and Web browser. Vodafone will sell the iPhone in 10 countries. O2 has described the device as a star performer which draws increased numbers of customers into its stores. Customers using the phone have also driven up data revenues by surfing the Internet and sending emails, a key attraction to operators as the cost of making calls decreases. "Later this year, Vodafone customers in Australia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa and Turkey will be able to purchase the iPhone for use on the Vodafone network," the British-based firm said in a statement without giving any more details
