 MANCHESTER, England, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's outstanding defensive display in their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona on Tuesday was as much a key element in their victory as Paul Scholes' stunning match-winner. The midfielder's 25-metre thunderbolt in the 14th minute was all that separated the sides after 180 minutes of a pulsating two-legged tie and secured the home side a third appearance in the final after previous victories in 1968 and 1999. However, United's delirious supporters, who created an unforgettable atmosphere inside Old Trafford, should be still thanking the side's defenders when they book their tickets to Moscow for the May 21 final. England mainstay Rio Ferdinand was in imperious form, winning tackle after tackle, and Wes Brown was so committed to stopping everything, he accidentally kicked Manchester Untied goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the head. Patrice Evra, one of the central figures in the fracas with the Stamford Bridge groundsmen after United's loss at Chelsea on Saturday, was given a tough night by Lionel Messi, but came out on top as the Argentine failed to score or create a goal. Owen Hargreaves, playing at right back, rarely put a foot wrong against Andres Iniesta, and even when Barcelona did get a strike on goal, Van der Sar stopped everything that came his way. United boss Alex Ferguson was forced into a defensive reshuffle after Nemanja Vidic failed to recover from a facial injury suffered against Chelsea, but the manager said that did not cause him too much concern. "Wes Brown is a natural defender and slotted into that position, so I was not too worried about that," Ferguson told reporters. CLEAN SHEETS United's defence did not concede a goal for the 30th time in 53 matches this seasonand they have also kept a clean sheet for five successive Champions League games. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard however, was not totally enthralled by United's performance. "I think that the level of the English teams is very high. If it weren't for the fact that two teams had to play each other (Arsenal and Liverpool in the quarter-final) we could easily have seen all four teams in the semi-final. "They are very difficult to beat, very strong and very disciplined." "But when they play in European games it's not the same (as in the domestic league). They all get behind the ball, they were very well organised and play with counter attacks. "It's a pity because the English teams have a lot more to give on the pitch to the public. "It's strange to see English teams defending, defending and defending with their lives and trying to win with the counter attack. "I think they can do a lot more. They have their own spirit their own culture but you don't see it in European football." Of more immediate concern to Rijkaard though is his own future and staying in his job after two seasons without a trophy since Barcelona won the European Cup in 2006. His attack also let him down. Although Messi was the best player on the field, Barca failed to convert any of the chances he created and their failure in attack, coupled with United's resolute defending, decided the game. United will face the winners of Wednesday's second semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea in the Champions League's first all-English final. The sides drew 1-1 at Anfield last Tuesday
