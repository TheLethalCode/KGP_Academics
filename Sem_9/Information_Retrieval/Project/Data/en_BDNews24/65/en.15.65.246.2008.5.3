 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) - TIB trustee board chairman Professor Muzaffer Ahmad Saturday alleged that anticorruption drives had lost pace. "The chief of the Anticorruption Commission delivered some brave speeches after having taken over charge of the commission in a changed situation. It now seems his speeches were not that bold," Muzaffer said at a discussion meeting on World Press Freedom Day at the Jatiya Press Club. The Transparency International, Bangladesh boss said the ACC boss had spoken of his limitations in his recent speeches. "A news analysis on his speeches since his takeover will prove that," he said. Muzaffer also said he had found lack of transparency and accountability in the ACC and its chairman in recent times. "It may so happen that he could not work the way he did before because of some invisible forces," he said. He asked the commission to make everything clear about its drives to avoid rumours. Silence spawns rumours, he said. Bangladesh National UNESCO Club organised the discussion. Muzaffer stressed providing access for people to information on all government and nongovernmental organisations. The TIB boss praised the government move to make the Right to Information Act and said that it would ensure people's access to information on private and public organisations. Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said that a democratic system without freedom of the media would be a farce. "Besides, economic freedom is directly linked with free media," he added. He said that journalists of Bangladesh did good work despite many hurdles. "Journalists played a significant role during the Liberation War in 1971, Language Movement and other democratic movements," he added. bdnews
