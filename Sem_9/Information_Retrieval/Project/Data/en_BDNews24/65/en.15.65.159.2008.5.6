<TEXT>
 Mon May 5, PARIS (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue received one of France's top cultural awards on Monday, the day before her world tour kicked off in Paris. Minogue was made a Chevalier dans l'ordre des Arts et Lettres (Knight of Arts and Letters) for "the cultural pleasure she has given French people" and for her love of France, a French Culture Ministry official said. "Princess of pop, uncontested queen of the dance floors, you are a sort of Midas of the international music scene who turns everything she touches into gold, from records to micro-shorts," Culture Minister Christine Albanel said presenting the award. "Even if it isn't the part of your anatomy which is the most often praised by the media, you have a big heart," she added. Pop group Police won the award in October 2007 and other knights include U.S. film stars Sharon Stone and Clint Eastwood.
