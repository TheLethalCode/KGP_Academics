 Jerusalem, Wed Apr 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert held talks in Jordan on Wednesday with Jordanian King Abdullah on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Olmert's bureau said in a statement. "The two leaders discussed the peace process and ways to make progress towards the objectives set at the Annapolis conference," the statement said about the visit, which was not announced in advance. The US-hosted conference in Annapolis, Maryland last November relaunched Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations that have shown little visible sign of progress. The United States hopes both sides can reach a Palestinian statehood deal before U.S. President George W Bush leaves office in January. A spokesman for Olmert declined to elaborate on his trip to Jordan, a week after King Abdullah met Bush in Washington as part of a diplomatic drive to shore up Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Bush is due to visit the region next month to mark Israel's 60th anniversary. He also plans to hold talks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt with Arab leaders, including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Olmert last visited Jordan, Israel's eastern neighbor, in January. Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994
