 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh women's national cricket team Friday received an unpleasant welcome to the Women's Asia Cup when they suffered a humiliating 182-run defeat to India in their tournament opener at Kurunegala in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh were bundled out for a paltry 68 in 30.2 overs after India racked up a challenging 250 for three in 50 overs riding on an unbeaten century from Mithali Raj. It was the first defeat for the Bangladeshi women in competitive cricket since they were introduced at the international stage last year. The women team have gone to play the Asian Cup after emerging unbeaten champions in the ACC Trophy and having defeated Hong Kong 4-0 at home, but the reality was totally different against the tougher side. After being put in to bowl first, Bangladesh had started positively reducing the formidable India to 48-2 in 17.3 overs, but noting went in their favour after that. Indian captain Raj pairing with Jaya Sharma put on 110 runs for the third wicket and eventually ended up at 250. Raj scored an attacking unbeaten century of 109 off 92 balls that included 15 fours and a six while opener Jaya Sharma made 72 off 118 balls featuring eight fours. Bangladesh, in reply, faced tough bowling from pacer Jhulan Goswami, who removed Shukhtara (2), Panna Gosh (1) and Shathira Jakir (12) in a row and finally returned four for 18. Bangladesh never recovered the damage and spinner Pujare Seema wiped the middle and tail claiming five wickets for 17 runs. Only two Bangladeshi players Sathira Zakir (12) and Irin Sultana (19) reached double digits. Bangladesh will take on Pakistan at the same venue Saturday. In the other match of the day, hosts Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan.
