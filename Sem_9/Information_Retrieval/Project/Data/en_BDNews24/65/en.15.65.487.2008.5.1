 Patrick Lannin OSLO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor has reported first-quarter core earnings that were below forecast, but stuck to its forecasts for the full year. First-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 7.12 billion crowns ($1.49 billion) from 7.04 billion a year earlier and were below an average forecast of 7.34 billion in a Reuters poll of 16 analysts. "In the first quarter of 2008 we saw continued underlying revenue growth combined with a stable EBITDA margin," Chief Executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas said in a statement. "The appreciation of the Norwegian crown puts pressure on our reported revenue growth," he added. The company reiterated its guidance for 2008 revenue growth of around 5 per cent, an EBITDA margin before other income and expenses above 31 per cent and capital expenditure equal to about 20 per cent of revenue. Telenor, which has expanded strongly into the emerging markets of eastern Europe and Asia, has been reporting figures without a contribution from Ukrainian operator Kyivstar due to a legal row with co-owner Altimo, part of billionaire Mikhail Friedman's Alfa Group. But Telenor said Kyivstar continued to perform well, with first-quarter EBITDA up to 1.86 billion crowns from 1.69 billion and the EBITDA margin up to 60.3 per cent from 59.6 per cent. Core earnings slipped in its home market Norwegian mobile and fixed-line operations, rose in Sweden and fell in Denmark and Hungary. DTAC of Thailand saw a rise in EBITDA, but Grameenphone of Bangladesh saw its earnings fall slightly. "In Asia, we see a more turbulent business environment with a significant increase in prices for basic goods, such as rice and fuel, affecting purchasing power," Baksaas added. "In spite of these challenges, our operations are performing well this quarter. Strong competition and high market growth in Bangladesh will continue to put pressure on ARPU and margins in Grameenphone," he added. Telenor shares closed at 99.60 crowns on Tuesday, valuing the company at about $US32.6 billion. Trade on the Oslo bourse resumes at 1700 AEST.
