 LONDON, May 2 (Reuters Life!/bdnews24.com) - The number of British women arrested for being drunk and disorderly has risen by more than 50 percent in the past five years, and soared by over 1,000 percent in some areas, police figures showed on Friday. Campaigners said the rise in arrest figures reflect the deliberate targeting of women by pubs and clubs offering cheap drinks and free entry. Mike Craik, chief constable of Northumbria police in northern England, where such arrests rose by 48 percent to 2,101, called for action on pricing, a ban on advertising and increased regulation. "There should also be an end to discounted drinks, such as two-for-one deals, happy hours and supermarkets selling alcohol at below cost prices," he told Channel 4 News Online. "There should be a ban on the sale of alcopops and no advertising of alcohol. Consideration should be given to pricing which is relevant to its strength. The figures from 38 of the 52 UK police forces were collected by the station's online team. Of the 38 who responded, only 21 were able to provide like-for-like figures over the five-year period. Those showed a 53 percent increase in arrests, from 3,847 in 2003/4, to 5,891 in 2007/8. The Portman Group, a drinks industry organization which campaigns against alcohol abuse, said it takes its responsibility seriously and works within codes of conduct. It told Channel 4 that education rather than pricing was the key issue.
