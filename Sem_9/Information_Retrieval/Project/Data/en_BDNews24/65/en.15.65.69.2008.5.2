<TITLE> Volatility snaps rice-wheat price link </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Naveen Thukral KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 -- (bdnews24.com/Reuters) Unprecedented volatility in rice and wheat prices has upended the traditional price link between the world's two staple foods, and analysts say it may stay broken for longer than usual this time. After decades when prices usually moved in lock-step with each other, the two have diverged in recent months. Thai rice is now nearly three times the price of U.S. wheat, an almost record high premium that could force aid agencies, and poorer consumers, to favour the cheaper staple, analysts say. Although it is unlikely to cause a big enough change in behavior to rebalance prices swiftly, they say that over time wheat prices should ultimately move closer to the Asian staple. "Wheat may go down 15 percent to 20 percent from current levels, but rice is going to stay more expensive because the governments now have tendencies to build stocks," said John Baize, a U.S.-based commodities analyst. "The differential will be pretty high." Since 1980, hard red winter wheat in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has traded at an average of 43 percent less than rice in Thailand, the world's top exporter, IMF data show. By and large, wheat prices traded at between 40 and 60 percent of the price of rice, and any deviation was quickly corrected. But prices are now testing the extremes of that bond. Back in October, wheat prices zoomed to near parity with rice, as speculators piled into the U.S. grains market amid a heavy drain on global stocks; that has happened only once before. Since then, wheat markets have plunged nearly 40 percent from February peaks as farmers plant a bumper crop, while rice prices have nearly trebled to a record above $1,000 a tonne on panic buying fuelled by export curbs from India and Vietnam, though they are now showing signs of easing.

Wheat, at the moment, is about one-third the price of rice, a gap that may widen before it narrows again. STRANGE RELATIONSHIP On the surface, the relationship is a strange one. Wheat and rice rarely vie for the same crop land. While most rice is grown and consumed in very wet areas of Asia, production of wheat is more widespread around the world, mostly grown on drier land that would be inhospitable to rice. Most consumers are also unlikely to switch between the two, although analysts say sustained higher prices could shift demand at the margins, particularly in countries with larger impoverished populations to feed. "A lot of Asian countries are importers of wheat, so there could be some substitution," said Darren Cooper, senior economist with London-based International Grains Council. "...particularly in a country like Indonesia, they import quite a lot of wheat." In Japan, the world's fourth-largest wheat importer, the government is campaigning to encourage households to eat more rice, of which it has more than enough, instead of noodles or bread, which require imported wheat. Aid organizations, which usually work on tight budgets, would also prefer to distribute wheat instead of rice. "They obviously have a fixed budget, so they will go for a cheaper substitute," said one Singapore-based grains trader. "As a result (of high price), whatever rice was going (in aid) may also stop." Still those quantities are small. The World Food Programme bought just over 2 million tonnes of food last year, of which rice was about 15 percent while wheat and wheat flour were 23 percent. The world's combined output of rice and wheat is around 1 billion tonnes a year, although only about 135 million tonnes of that is freely traded on the global market. On top of that, the fundamental differences in the way rice and wheat trade makes any near-term correction difficult. Global wheat prices are determined on the CBOT futures exchange, where traders are already anticipating a strong rebound in supplies this year. Rice prices are determined in the opaque, over-the-counter physical market in Bangkok, meaning prices are unlikely to fall too far until new crops are delivered. In the longer-term, however, wheat prices may ultimately find their equilibrium at a higher price relative to rice, as rising income levels in China, India and elsewhere in Asia drive up consumption of protein-rich meat at the expense of rice. "The gradual increase in the numbers of middle class who demand more meat-based food that requires cereals rather than rice for the feed," said one London-based grains analyst who declined to be named.
