 OAKLAND, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maria Sharapova hit out at the ruling body of women's tennis (WTA) on Friday for making her take part in a publicity shoot on the eve of the Italian Open. Sharapova could be fined $700,000 if she declines to do the shoot, which is part of the WTA's multi-million dollar global marketing campaign. The tournament begins on May 12.

This is not about just one shoot, I could not just sit back anymore." FLEXIBILITY The WTA said Sharapova had the option of doing a two-and-a-half hour shoot, allowing for transport time. "We will be as flexible as possible to accommodate all the player schedules, but we are not making exceptions," said WTA spokesman Andrew Walker. The WTA was working to raise the profile of the players, something their agents had been striving for, he added. "This is an opportunity to do it as we are putting millions of dollars into this worldwide campaign. It's important for women's tennis and while we are sensitive to the demands of the tournament on our players, they've known about it for some time. "It's in the rules
