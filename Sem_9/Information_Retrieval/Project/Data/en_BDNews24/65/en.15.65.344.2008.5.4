 Seoul, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least eight were people killed when they were swept away by high waves that hit a port on Sunday on the west coast of South Korea, a coastguard official said. Twelve others were rescued after the waves caused by storms and high wind hit the Yellow Sea port of Boryeong Namdo, about 185 km (115 miles) southwest of Seoul. They were taken to hospital, where five were in critical condition, the official said. "Apparently, some people were fishing and others walking along the coast when the accident happened," said Lee Won-il of the Taean coastguard.
