 SINGAPORE, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices held near record highs on Tuesday after storming past $120 a barrel on Monday, pushing up gold prices and stalling a recovery in Asian stocks. The US dollar was broadly weaker as doubts resurfaced on about the health of the US economy, while high oil prices boosted currencies of commodity exporters such as the Australian and Canadian dollars. The relentless surge in commodities from oil to rice is a key concern for central banks, although some investors have started to price in the view that the worst of the credit crisis and the US economic slowdown could be over. By 10:30 pm EDT, MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was 0.1 percent weaker, backing off a four-month high hit on Monday. The benchmark has risen 2 percent in the last two sessions but is down 6 percent so far this year. US light crude for June delivery CLc1, a global benchmark, rose 22 cents to $120.19 a barrel. It jumped more than $4 on Monday to a record high of $120.36. "A lot of this is supply-driven, with the market very vulnerable to any disruption in supplies," said Mark Pervan, a senior commodities analyst at Australian & New Zealand Bank. "We're seeing large oil-producing countries coming up as a question mark," he said. The rise in oil to a fresh record high raised market concerns about the outlook for US consumer spending. Prices of oil and other dollar-denominated commodities usually rise to adjust for inflation when the US currency falls. Stock markets in Australia , Taiwan and Singapore fell between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. Hong Kong .HSI eased while South Korea was flat as trading resumed after a holiday. Japanese markets remain closed for a national holiday. U.S. stocks declined on Monday on worries that Bank of America Corp might walk away from buying troubled lender Countrywide Financial Corp, talk which Bank of America denied. Record oil prices also hit stocks. GOLD ADVANCES Gold extended gains, adding to a rise of nearly 2 percent in New York, helped by bargain hunting and higher oil prices, which enhanced the metal's appeal as a hedge against inflation. Gold was changing hands around $873.70/874.70 an ounce, up from $871.15/872.55 in late New York trading on Monday. It hit a four-month low of $845 on Friday. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar eased to 73.015 .DXY, having backed off a 73.698 high on Friday. The euro bought $1.5500, although dealers said the market appeared to be in the mood to test resistance around $1.5570. The dollar was trading around 104.90 yen after it failed to sustain a high of 105.92 on Monday. The rise in commodity prices comes at a time when Wall Street does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its next meeting in June. The Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate on April 30 by one-quarter point to 2 percent in what may be the last in a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hit hard by a housing slump and credit market turmoil. The US economy lost jobs for the fourth month in a row in April but at a slower pace than earlier in the year, easing fears the economy was slipping into a deep recession, although the rise in oil prices has raised some fresh doubts. Europe will be a major focus of investors' attention this week as the European Central Bank and Bank of England hold policy reviews against a backdrop of weakening economic strength. Both are expected to keep rates on hold
