<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader M Saifur Rahman said Friday that there would be no meaningful election without former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. "I don't think we will get a meaningful election without the two leaders," the former finance minister said as the BNP leaders from Sylhet met him in the city. "There should be options for the two leaders to engage in the election process," he said. Saifur, who is leading a faction of the BNP, also said he wanted "a greater participation" of the people in the polls. Meanwhile, BNP factional leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain has separately called upon all political parties and the people to thwart what he said was an ill-designed election. Speaking at a May Day discussion at the National Press Club, organised by the Sramik Dal, Delwar said they would resist an election that would lack people's mandate. Delwar, known as a Khaleda loyalist, asked all political parties to stand united for the cause. bd
