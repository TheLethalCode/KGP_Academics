<TITLE> Limelight on Scholes but midfielder shies away </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The headlines screamed his name on Wednesday but Manchester United's match-winning goalscorer Paul Scholes kept a typically low profile. The 33-year-old midfielder's brilliant long-range strike secured a 1-0 aggregate win over Barcelona on Tuesday to send United into the Champions League final against either Chelsea or Liverpool in Moscow on May 21. "MoSCHOw here we come" yelled the back page of the Daily Mirror, "Paul of Fame!" shouted the Sun and "Scholes scorcher blasts Reds to Moscow" wrote the Daily Telegraph. But the shy Scholes, who has said he prefers to do his talking on the pitch, had declined all media interviews and the Times wrote that he had probably gone straight from the dressing room "home to Oldham for a glass of milk". A product of the United youth academy, Scholes has spent his entire career at the northwest club and last week made his 100th Champions League appearance. Distraught at missing United's 1999 triumph through suspension, he has now given himself a second chance. "Finally" was the headline in the Independent, while the Daily Mail wrote "Redemption! Nine-year wait is over for Scholes as wonder goal fires United into the final". Chelsea host Liverpool on Wednesday and are favourites to progress after the first leg ended 1-1 and the matter of a first-time all-English final also occupied British soccer writers on Wednesday. "Scrub the blinis and caviar from the Moscow menus and prepare for the full English. Replace the ice-cold vodka shots with warm beer. Russia's capital will belong to the English on May 21," wrote the Daily Telegraph
