 KABUL, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four children and three policemen were killed in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday by two accidental munitions blasts, the Interior Ministry said. One of the blasts happened as children knocked the munition against a rock in a residential area that was the scene of bitter fighting between rival Afghan factions in the 1990s, it said.
