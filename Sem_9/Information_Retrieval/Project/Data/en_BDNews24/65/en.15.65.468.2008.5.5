<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 05 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday stayed for two months a graft case against Awami League leader Mosharraf Hossain filed by the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption. The HC also issued a rule on the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain within four weeks why the case against the former minister should not be quashed. Upon a petition filed by the detained political leader, the HC bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Shamim Hasnain passed the order. On April 10, 2002, the Bureau's inspector Jalauddin Ahmed filed a case with Motijheel Police Station against Mosharraf and former AL MP Master Mujibur Rahman. According to an allegation, Mosharraf on May 16, 2001 recommended a plot allotment in favour of Mujibur in Uttara instead of Gulshan by abusing powers as public works minister. In April 7 this year, Mosharraf filed a petition with the HC for quashing the case. Barrister Shafiq Ahmed moved the petition for Mosharraf, while advocate Anisul Haque represented the ACC in court. bd
