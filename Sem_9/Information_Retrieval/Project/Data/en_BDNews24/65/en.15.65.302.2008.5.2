 Rajshahi, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Outlawed operatives shot and killed one policeman and hurt four others before they seized five firearms from the law-enforcement team in Bagmara upazila of Rajshahi Friday evening. Four of the lost firearms were Chinese-made, Bagmara police chief Fayzul Islam told bdnews24.com. "The police team was patrolling a weekly cattle market in Taherpur area," he said. Mizanur Rahman, a constable from Panchagarh, died from wounds after he was shot in the head. His body was retrieved from a pond near Taherpur Degree College. Four injured people were Naik Shahinur, constables Samiul Kabir and Sarwar Hossain and Ansar member Abdul Aziz. An hour after the daring incident, the wounded were rushed to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital at 9pm. A group of 25 armed attackers launched the attack around 6.30pm while the patrol team was preparing to return to the police station. The attackers first stabbed the policemen and then opened fire on them forcing the law enforcers to fight back. But the police were overpowered soon by the gang. The Rapid Action Battalion rushed to the scene and rescued the wounded law enforcers an hour later, a police officer said. The Bagmara police chief said Purbobanglar Communist Party (Lal Pataka) left leaflets on the scene after the attack. bdne
