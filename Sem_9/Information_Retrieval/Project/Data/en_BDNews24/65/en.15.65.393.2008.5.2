 Munshiganj, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Three people went missing after a car with four passengers on board slipped into the river Padma off Mawa Ferry Station in Munshiganj Friday, a senior official said. One of the four, 20-year-old Nusrat Jahan, daughter of architect Rezaul Karim, was rescued alive. The circumstances in which the incident took place were not clear. But a witness said the car slipped into the river when Rezaul, 55, was manoeuvring the vehicle near the Pontoon No. 1. The two others who are missing are Rezaul's wife Shahanara Karim, 41, and their son Safat Karim, 10. Munshiganj DC Md Muniruddin told bdnews24.com that district officials had asked for divers to be sent in from Dhaka. "We started a rescue operation. But rough weather and a strong tide hampered the efforts," he said. Rezaul, a resident of Lalmatia in Dhaka, and his family went sightseeing near the Padma. Rezaul sent his chauffer Tabibur Rahman to Mawa Bazar and was driving the car himself, the DC said. bdnews2
