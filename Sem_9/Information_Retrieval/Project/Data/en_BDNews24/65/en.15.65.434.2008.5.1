 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com) - The government Thursday asked deputy commissioners of six coastal districts to take all preparations as tropical cyclone Nargis moved further to make a landfall, a senior government official said. DCs of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Bhola, Noakhali, Laxmipur and Bagerhat were asked to take cautionary preparations to face any emergency situation, food and disaster management secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman said after a meeting of senior government officials and meteorologists. The government also asked the Red Crescent Society to stay alert against the cyclone and to protect property of the people. Meteorologists said Nargis might make a landfall in Myanmar. Related agencies and the offices of deputy commissioners opened control rooms to watch the cyclone round the clock. The weather office in Bangladesh Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port. Arjumand Habib, director of the Met office, told bdnews24.com that the cyclone was likely to cut its path through Myanmar coasts. Under the peripheral influence of the storm, the low-lying areas of the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by storm surges as high as 5 feet above the normal astronomical tide. bdnews24
