<TITLE> How Obama got his momentum back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Releigh, North Carolina, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Down on his luck two weeks ago, an annoyed Barack Obama complained, "Why can't I eat my waffle?" when a reporter tossed him a question over breakfast at a Pennsylvania diner on the eve of the state's primary. On Tuesday morning, when the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination sat down to an omelet in a Greenwood, Indiana, diner he seemed elated. Voters were streaming to the polls in Indiana and North Carolina as Obama chatted about his hopes and expectations and joked about his weight. The drawn-out struggle between the Illinois senator and his rival Hillary Clinton has had many ups and downs. But on Tuesday Obama won a compelling victory in North Carolina's primary while Clinton eked out a narrow win in Indiana. Obama's aides declared the candidate's momentum was back and it was only a matter of time before Clinton would be forced to exit the race for the party's nomination. "We're nearing the finish line," said Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod. "We have a lot to celebrate tonight and I think the Clinton folks have a lot to think about." But if Obama is poised to wrap up the race soon, putting him closer to becoming the country's first African American president, it will be in spite of a series of setbacks he suffered over the past several weeks. In February, as he coasted to one victory after another, the confident and rhetorically gifted Obama was beginning to seem virtually certain to get his party's nod to face Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain in the November election. But he stumbled badly after video clips surfaced of the fiery sermons of his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Then, Clinton and McCain assailed Obama as an elitist after he made a remark about "bitter" small-town voters who cling to guns and religion. RENEWED VIGOR His losses in the Rust Belt states of Ohio and Pennsylvania led to questions about his electability because of his weak showing with white working class voters, traditionally a core Democratic constituency. Obama did little to help himself with a lackluster debate performance in Philadelphia in which he was put on the defensive about Wright, his patriotism and why he chose not to wear a flag pin on his lapel. He later expressed annoyance with the moderator's superficial questions and caught flak from reporters for his reluctance to take questions over the following couple of days. In the run-up to the April 22 Pennsylvania vote, Obama often seemed tired and talked of missing his two daughters who were at home in Chicago as he was having mixed success wooing blue-collar voters in pubs, bowling allies and diners. The low point for Obama came when Wright stepped back into the spotlight and unapologetically repeated his charges that the U.S. government bore some blame for the September 11 attacks and the spread of AIDS to blacks. Then, Obama did something he was reluctant to do before: he unequivocally cut his ties with Wright, saying he did not know his longtime pastor as well as he thought he did. A day later, Obama hit the campaign trail in Indiana with renewed vigor, taking a page from the tenacious Clinton and putting in longer days jam-packed with events like picnics and visits to roller rinks, aimed to show his "regular guy" side. His wife, Michelle, was by his side and they were joined on the weekend by their two daughters, Sasha, 6, and Malia, 9. A more relaxed Obama was comfortable and took questions from reporters frequently and appeared more spontaneous. He sometimes changed his schedule to engage with voters in a game of basketball, his favorite sport. The presence of Obama's wife and daughters also helped the campaign's effort to allow voters to get to know Obama in a more personal way. He talked often about his biography and his upbringing by a single mother and his grandparents. As the campaign marathon was coming to a close, Obama rose at 4:30 a.m. to do television interviews and visit workers on a construction site. He ended his day at midnight greeting workers at a car plants in Indiana as they came off the late shift. By early Wednesday morning, Obama was headed home. When his plane touched down in Chicago, he was grinning ear to ear. His aides told him that the Indiana results were still unclear but that Clinton's lead was very narrow. "Good job" he told his senior aides, just before leaving the plane.
