 NASHVILLE, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At the Grammys in February, Beyonce introduced her as "the Queen." In the fall, Tina Turner will take it to her loyal subjects. The Rock Hall of Famer plans to embark on her first tour in eight years beginning October1 at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. The arena tour will be promoted by AEG Live and will include about three dozen shows in North America, likely to be followed by engagements in Europe and other international dates. Turner announced the tour at a taping of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" set to air Thursday. She said tickets will go on sale May 12. Turner's 2000 tour, billed as her last, was the top-grossing jaunt of that year, according to Billboard Boxscore. It grossed almost $110 million from 89 shows and drew more than 2 million people, averaging more than 24,000 a night in attendance. At the time it was the top-grossing tour ever by a female artist. The record has since been topped by Cher and Madonna.
