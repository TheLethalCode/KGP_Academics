 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com) - Three of a family died and two others were injured in Ghonarpara area of Cox's Bazar after their house caught fire early Saturday. Dipak Shwarma Dipu, a resident of Ghonarpara, said that the dead were Prodip Acharya, 45, his wife Kalpana Acharya, 38, and son Sujan Acharya, 20. The house was located next to Krishnanandadham. Prodip Acharya's sons Roky Acharya, 16, and Durjoy Acharya, 8, and eight others living in the two-storey tin-roofed building were injured. Ground-floor residents managed to escape before the fire engulfed the building, he said. Prodip and his family had lived on the first floor of the building. Shahinul Islam, who works in Cox's Bazar Fire Service, said a fire-fighting team led by station officer Didarul Islam put out the fire. Shahinul said the firefighters could not reach the house immediately because the road to the house was too narrow for a car to get in. The trigger in the fire could not be known immediately. The injured people were admitted to Cox's Bazar District Sadar Hospital. bdnews2
