 BUENOS AIRES, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champions Boca Juniors' Libertadores Cup match at home to Cruzeiro finished one minute early on Wednesday after a linesman was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Television pictures showed the Uruguayan official being treated for a cut on his forehead after the incident in the second minute of stoppage-time at the Bombonera stadium. Referee Jorge Larrionda, who had signalled three minutes of added time, immediately finished the game. The injured official had been running the line in front of the stand where the most expensive seats and the VIP boxes, including the one used by former Argentina captain Diego Maradona, are located. Boca were winning 2-1. On previous occasions where matches have been suspended in similar circumstances, the South American Football Confederation has allowed results to stand. Three years ago a Libertadores Cup match against Guadalajara at the same stadium was abandoned following a crowd riot in the second half. Boca escaped with a three-match home ban in international competition
