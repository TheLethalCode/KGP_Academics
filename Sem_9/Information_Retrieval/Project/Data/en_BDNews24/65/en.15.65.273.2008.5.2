 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 02 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh shrimp industry leaders have dismissed the allegations of extensive worker and human-rights abuses, cited in a report by the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisation. The industry uses child labourers and exploits women workers, the report alleges. AFL-CIO, a voluntary federation of 56 national and international labour unions, last month published the report "The True Cost of Shrimp" on shrimp industries in Bangladesh and Thailand. But industry associations in Bangladesh said the report was based on old statistics. They said the report would create cynicism when the government and the associations were working together to implement the labour law made in October 2006. Industry leaders said the damning report would hurt the industry leading to buyers hesitating to import from Bangladesh. They also said that a vicious circle was working to ruin the shrimp industry. The report says a number of organisations have identified "extensive worker and human rights abuses" in the shrimp industry. It says "most reports have concentrated on power imbalances on shrimp farming", which help local power brokers grab lands from farmers to set up farms, causing environmental devastation. Organisations such as the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) have identified land grab, use of child and forced labour, and reduced local access to land, water and other resources as key abuses. Many international NGOs and development agencies also expressed concerns over the impact of shrimp trade on local peoples and the issues such as food safety and environmental preservation, according to the report by AFL-CIO. It also says the Solidarity Centre and its partner organisations had found labour abuses, including "shifts over 12 hours a day, forced and unpaid overtime, failure to get minimum wages, inadequate healthcare and childcare resources, and insufficient health and safety standards at most facilities from interviewing shrimp processing workers". On worker wages, the report says factory owners pay a "perplexing variety of wages to workers most of which are very low". The newer workers' pay is equivalent to $23 a month while more experienced ones earn more or less $26, the report says. Still, they are much fortunate than contract employees who work for piece rates and are often paid 15 cents for every 22 pounds of shrimp they clean, it says. Workers have to work from 8.00am to 8.00pm. Some say that they stand the entire time. Workers of five different processing companies noted a straight 26-hour shift that takes place every other Friday morning and ends Saturday evening. The pressing concern however is the industry's dependence on child labour, according to AFL-CIO. It is estimated that 13.4 percent of Bangladeshi children, aged 5 to 14, are labourers. "They are involved in loading finished products onto trucks and not counted as a company's employee." Speaking on the report, Syed Mahmudul Haque, chairman of Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, said the report would create cynicism in a time when the associations and the government are working together to implement the labour law. "The report used old statistics. It can cause boycott of our products by consumer-rights associations of different countries which would lead to a decline in exports as well as closures of plants and a rise in unemployment," he told bdnews24.com. Haque quoted Wally Stevens, executive director of Global Aquaculture Association (GAA), as saying they expect a solution to the problems rather than creating an "air of uncertainty". Stevens challenged the report in an interview on CNN that was aired in the US edition of the network. Stevens reportedly questioned why the authors chose to release the report without contacting GAA, arguably a leading global aquaculture standards-setting organisation. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters' Association President Kazi Belayat echoed Haque. David John Wales, resident representative of American Centre for International Labour Solidarity, according to Belayat, also said the report had used old statistics. "Our jute sector has already been destroyed. Now this is a new conspiracy to ruin our garments and shrimp industry," he told bdnews24.com. The BFFEA president claimed that the shrimp industry had already implemented 80 percent of the labour law. Bangladesh was among the world's top 10 shrimp producers in 2006 and it is rapidly expanding industry in Bangladesh, the report says. The report quoting a US government source said at least 142,000 families or more than 600,000 people depend directly on the industry. Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation puts the number at 600,000 direct workers, who support some 3.5 million dependants. bdnews2
