<TITLE> Govt going slow in gas supply: Tamim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken a temporary measure not to provide new gas connections to industrial units in Chittagong. "No new gas connections are being given to any industrial unit in Chittagong for now," the chief adviser's special assistant Prof M Tamim told a seminar on the power sector Monday. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry organised the seminar on "The present picture of the power sector and future development strategy". Tamim, who oversees the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, said the government was also going slow in providing gas connections in Dhaka. The measure is temporary. "Whatever measure has been taken to rationalise gas supply is purely temporary," an energy official explained to bdnews24.com. "Things will be normal soon," the official added. But businessmen expressed worries over Tamim's statement and said its consequences would be "very serious". Tamim said: "Connections will be given to the units about which decisions have already been taken. We are trying to sort out the problems of the power and gas sectors. I hope we will find new gas." "It is time we gave priority to the use of gas." Tamim said: "There was a fundamental mistake in our first energy policy. It should have specifically mentioned whether local energy would be used for supporting the economy or for increasing revenues." "It has not been made clear. It is time to take a decision in this regard. I think local energy should be used to support the economy," he said. "We want to share infrastructure with the private sector. The private sector will be allowed to use distribution and transmission lines," Prof Tamim said. Replying to the questions of businessmen, Power Division secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan said the irrigation season would officially end on May 15. "Then power will be diverted from irrigation, which will improve the situation," he said. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed predicted that a gas crisis would set in by 2011. "Production did not increase keeping with demand. The situation will deteriorate. Petrobangla does not have funds to invest." FBCCI president Annisul Huq said: "It is very frustrating for us. There is the need for gas and power for new industries. It is slowing new investment in Chittagong." BUET professor Nurul Islam said corruption and foot-dragging and ignorance are largely responsible for the "pitiable condition" of the sector. bdnews
