 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) plans to hold two tournaments before the second edition of the B. League likely to get underway in September this season. To give shape to the thoughts, the BFF executive committee led by Kazi Salahuddin sits for the first time after being elected on April 28. "We are considering organising two tournaments of the federation cup in July and a tri-nation club cup meet in August before starting the 2nd B. League in September," BFF vice president Badal Roy told reporters after emerging from an unofficial meeting of the new BFF members Tuesday. Roy said that the booters' transfer of B. League might take place on the scheduled May 15 as a tri-party agreement among clubs, federation and players was earlier signed. The former national footballer-turn-organiser said that they were also thinking of reviving the popular tournament of national football championship The previous committee led by SA Sultan failed to hold the Federation Cup last season, and omitted the national football championship and failed to hold any international tournament during its five-year (one year extended by FIFA) stint. Roy said that the meeting would also discuss some matters like forming different standing committees including committees of 7-member emergency, national team, B. League, disciplinary and players' status. The emergency committee, which must consist of the president and vice president, will take decision in crisis moments if the 21-member committee cannot sit while the national team committee will look after all matters related to the national team. The meeting will also revise the yearly calendar, which was designed by the previous committee, to avoid overlapping of different meets, and will discuss the upcoming SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in June. Roy also hinted that the meeting might take decision to stage Futsal football in a bid to increase player skills.
