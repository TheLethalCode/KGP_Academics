<TEXT>
 KARACHI, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board will withdraw a 220 million rupees (2.7 million pound) lawsuit against fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, his lawyer said on Monday. PCB Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf filed the defamation suit in a civil court after Shoaib accused him in a television interview of demanding money from him and other players to allow them to play in a lucrative Twenty20 league in India. The allegations came after Shoaib was banned for five years by the PCB's disciplinary committee for several counts of indiscipline. Shoaib made an unconditional apology at an appeal hearing late last month and the PCB on Sunday suspended the ban for one month to allow him to play in the league. "Shoaib came and apologised to the PCB Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf in person and showed remorse and asked for forgiveness, accepting that he had levelled false and baseless allegations against him," lawyer Tafazzul Rizvi told Reuters. Rizvi said the PCB chairman had therefore decided not to pursue the suit. "We will withdraw the case from court since the honour and dignity of the PCB chairman stand vindicated," Rizvi added. Akhtar left for Delhi on Sunday to play in the league
