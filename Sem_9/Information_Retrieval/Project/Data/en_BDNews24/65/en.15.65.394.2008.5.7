 MILAN, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso would fit in perfectly at Bayern Munich, club president Franz Beckenbauer has said. Gattuso said last week he would consider his future at the end of the season. Milan have struggled this term, lying fourth in Serie A having been knocked out of the Champions League as holders by Arsenal in the last 16. "Is it true that Gattuso wants to leave Milan? I like him. He would be an important player for Bayern in the Champions League. Or rather he would be perfect," Beckenbauer told Wednesday's Gazzetta dello Sport. Another Italian, Luca Toni, has thrilled Bayern this season with 21 league goals in their run to the Bundesliga title. Media reports have reported Milan may be considering a bid but Beckenbauer said Toni was not for sale. "We are happy with him, very happy in fact. He is a goal machine. Toni will help Bayern to win the Champions League again as soon as possible," he said. Beckenbauer also doubted Bayern were looking at Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to replace retiring goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. "I don't think there are talks to buy the Fiorentina keeper," he said
