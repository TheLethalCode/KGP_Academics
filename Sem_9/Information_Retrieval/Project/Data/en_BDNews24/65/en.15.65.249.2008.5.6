 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina was taken to the court Tuesday for hearing in a graft case involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. She was taken from the special jail to the Special Judges' Court, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises around 9:45 am. Tuesday's court is supposed to finish hearing of a plea to withdraw all charges against Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former power secretary, another accused in the case. The court on April 30 finished hearing on the same plea for Hasina. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people, including Hasina. The graft watchdog accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews
