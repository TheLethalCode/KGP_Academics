 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League will not oppose the presence of army personnel in formal talks with the government, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Saturday. "We will not make any complaint if the government comes up for the dialogue along with the members of armed forces," Ashraful said after an evening meeting at acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. "As part of the country, the armed forces can be present at the dialogue," he said. Ashraful said the government gave the AL permission to observe a symbolic hunger strike on May 5. On the presence of the army at the dialogue, he said: "We cannot determine who the government will come to the dialogue with. And the government cannot determine who will represent the Awami League. But we complained against any presence of civil society." AL presidium members Tofail Ahmed and Motia Chowdhury were also present at the meeting. bdnews
