 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) Controversy surrounds the death of Awami League leader and BTV broadcaster Rashida Mahiuddin. Doctors at Anwer Khan Modern Hospital in Dhanmondi failed to say when her heart failed in the intensive care unit, where she lay for 10 hours after a dental operation. Rashida's relatives blamed the doctors for what they said was negligence of duty and wrong treatment that led to the death of the broadcaster. The hospital authorities denied the allegation. Hospital spokesman retired major Dr Muzibur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "The heart attack happened anytime between 11:00 pm Tuesday and 9:00 am Wednesday." "There were two duty doctors beside the patient. It is difficult to understand when the patient suffered the heart attack as her ECG was normal for a long time," said the head of the pain therapy department at Modern Diagnostic Centre. "The next day, on examination, it was found that she had suffered a heart attack and we started treatment instantly," Rahman said. "There was no negligence," he claimed. The National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) associated professor Wadud Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that a typical change is noticed in 50 percent cases of heart attack, and an atypical change is spotted in 25 percent. The remaining 25 percent patients show misleading signs after a heart attack, and presumably Rashida was in the third group, he said. "There was a chance of doctors making mistakes and starting treatment becomes too late. There was nothing to be done then," he added. "Doctors should have checked the patient repeatedly after the operation and been more careful," Chowdhury said. "It was unfortunate that the treatment was late," he said. Rashida was declared dead at LabAid Cardiac Hospital Thursday after she was transferred from Modern Hospital. Modern Hospital authorities said the patient had agreed to undergo general anesthesia. Prof Rahman said: "Although general anesthesia has an impact on the heart, it is safer than any other forms of anesthesia." Rashida was admitted to Modern Hospital in Dhanmondi with dental complaints. On the allegations of the family members, the doctor said: "This is natural on the family's part. The fact is, the patient was given anesthesia following her permission. Later she was kept under intensive care." "She was transferred to LabAid Hospital after she had a heart attack," Rahman said. "We won't protest the allegations of the relatives. The reality is, she died even after getting good treatment," he added. Anisur Rahman Babul, Rashida's cousin, told bdnews24.com: "My sister died from the negligence of doctors. Her diabetes was under control." "She was given anesthesia before her teeth were extracted. But the dose of the anesthesia was extreme and she fell ill," he said. "Her heart failed. Doctors did not give us proper information. There was no heart specialist there," Babul alleged. Doctors held a board meeting Saturday following a number of allegations over the death of Rashida. Prof Rahman, chief cardiac anesthesiologist, told bdnews24.com: "Examining the data of the patient we have come to a decision that there was no negligence in treatment." The patient's relatives including her sister Tahmina Zakaria, brother Shafiqul Alam and his wife as well as the driver observed the situation of the patient all the time, the doctor said. Dr Javed Iqbal Mahmud Pavel, who had treated Rashida for dental complaints, told bdnews24.com: "The patient was admitted to the hospital with serious dental complaints. Four of her teeth, worn out earlier, had serious wounds." "Her diabetes was out of control. There was no alternative to an emergency operation." "Her teeth were extracted with the permission of the patient. She was given general anesthesia instead of local anesthesiaalso with her permission," the doctor said. Anesthesia specialist Dr Kamal Ibrahim of Bangladesh Medical College and Hospital in Dhanmondi, who doubles up at Modern Hospital, told bdnews24.com: "The patient's diabetes half an hour before the operation was 7.8, which was uncontrolled." "The patient's blood pressure was 130/85. Her wound was from the mouth to the throat. She was given general anesthesia after her permission, as she would not be able to withstand local anesthesia," the doctor said. "The operation was complete in 15/20 minutes. She regained consciousness. A few minutes later, she became restless. She was having breathing problems and sweating. She was given ventilation." Prof Rahman said he had found water in her lungs Wednesday morning. "She was given medicine, but the cardiac problem did not improve." The patient needed urgent treatment at the time, but as Modern Hospital was not able to provide facilities such as angiogram, angioplasty and IABP, she was transferred to LabAid Hospital. Rashida was born in 1960. She was an Awami League leader and had worked as BTV broadcaster and public relations officer for Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. bdnews
