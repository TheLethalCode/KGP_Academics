 NEW YORK, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar jumped to two-month high versus the yen and against a basket of currencies on Friday after data showed the US economy lost just 20,000 jobs in April, fewer than economists had forecast. The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-cutting cycle, which enhances the appeal of the dollar. It also backed a growing view that the US economic slowdown may not be as deep as some originally thought. "It shows that the argument about whether the US is in deep recession or just a slowdown is being resolved in favor of the dollar bulls," said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist, at DailyFX.com in New York. The Labor Department said the US economy shed just 20,000 jobs last month. Markets were expecting job losses of 80,000, according to a Reuters poll. The euro fell against the dollar to $1.5362, the lowest since March 24, from $1.5479 before the data's release. It last traded at $1.5394, down 0.5 percent on the day. Against the yen, the dollar rose to 105.69, a two-month high, from 104.60. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose to two-month peaks at 73.698 and last traded at 73.544. The dollar also rose to a nine-week high versus the Swiss franc to 1.0596, before trading back down to 1.0574 francs. "The dollar had been strong going in, and this is all very positive for it. This news confirms the notion that we are just in a slowdown," Schlossberg said
