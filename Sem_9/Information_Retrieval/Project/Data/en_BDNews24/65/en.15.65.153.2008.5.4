<TITLE> US puts faith in new roads to build Afghan security </TITLE>

 Khost, Afghanistan, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On the face of it, there are not many similarities between battling cocaine kingpins in South America and fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. But for Major Dan Morgan, who runs US military operations in a large swathe of east Afghanistan and once worked in drug enforcement in Colombia, there is one unifying factor -- roads. In Colombia, when his team tried to wean locals away from coca leaves to grow crops like bananas instead, they realized it was only going to work if they built roads linking the banana plantations to local towns so the produce could be sold. In Afghanistan, where so much of the country is semi-lawless and inaccessible, trying to draw communities away from the influence of the Taliban again depends on building roads, so that locals can easily reach markets and join the economy. "When it comes down to it, roads are very, very significant," Morgan, the brigade operations officer for a task force of the 101st Airborne Division, said in an interview. "If you have a paved road here, you have fewer IEDs," he said, referring to the deadly roadside bombs the Taliban and other militants use to target U.S. and Afghan convoys. "Once you have a road you can also get Afghan forces to where they need to be more quickly, which improves security. As some have said: where a road ends, instability begins." The problem is, building roads takes time and costs huge amounts of money, up to $250,000 per kilometer for asphalt, according to U.S. engineers. And U.S. or Afghan forces need to impose security in an area before construction can begin. In the remote regions of eastern Afghanistan along the border with Pakistan, where the Taliban have traditionally been strong, linking isolated goat-herding communities with larger towns by road could take years -- not to mention the difficulty of building at altitudes of up to 12,000 feet. And all the time the Taliban are vying for the loyalty of the community, trying to shut out the influence of the Americans and the slowly improving Afghan National Army. "It's not quick, that's for sure," said Morgan. "It takes vision and it takes tactical patience. At the end of the day, 99 percent of the operations our brigade is working on are non-lethal." SPRING THREAT? While U.S. forces may not be seeing much major combat in the area Morgan oversees, they are heavily engaged in the south, where hundreds of U.S. Marines were last week deployed to take on the Taliban in Helmand province, the main base for more than 7,000 British troops serving as part of a NATO-led force. U.S. troops are also under pressure directly east of Kabul, along the Pakistan border, where militants filter across to carry out attacks, and where a suicide bomber last week killed more than a dozen people south of the city of Jalalabad. Now that winter has passed and the trails over the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan are more accessible, US forces are also bracing for an upsurge in militant attacks -- the type of spring offensive that has been seen in the past. So far US commanders say they have seen little uppick in the number of Taliban sneaking over the frontier, and Morgan says most infiltration points in his 24,000-square-mile (62,000-square-km) area are now secured by Afghan units or US special forces. But a potential peace deal between Pakistan's new government and Taliban in the country's northwest, along the Afghan border, could mean those militants turning away from fighting Pakistan security forces and focusing attention over the border. If that were to happen, US forces could find themselves with more of a fight on their hands, and projects such as road building may have to take more of a back seat. "It's a definite concern," Morgan said of the possibility of a Spring offensive. "If it's going to happen, it's going to start happening now. "We're prepared to defend ourselves ... My job is about getting a balance between lethal and non-lethal operations.
