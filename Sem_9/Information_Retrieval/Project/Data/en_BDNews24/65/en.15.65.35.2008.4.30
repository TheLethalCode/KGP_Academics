 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Wednesday the media had misquoted her on her remark about alleged 'money whitening' by Dr Kamal Hossain. Corrected and updated The Awami League president said she had not been specific on the figure of Tk 102 crore allegedly whitened by the senior lawyer, as reported in newspapers. "I did not say that Dr Kamal Hossain had whitened Tk 102 crore as reported in many newspapers. But I have a lot more information about him," she told her lawyers in the presence of reporters after appearing in court. Hasina was reported to have made the remarks about Dr Kamal on Apr 27 to her lawyers while appearing in court in a graft case involving the purchase of MiG-29 war planes. A number of newspapers published the comment the following day, to which Dr Kamal replied. The senior lawyer said: "I have not seen Tk 100 crore altogether in my life ever. The matter of whitening black money cannot be raised here. Sheikh Hasina is like my daughter." Hasina appeared in court Wednesday for a hearing in a graft case involving the setting up of barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. The AL chief said no misappropriation had taken place during her regime. "Charges were brought against me in the power plants case without the report of the evaluation committee. How can the authorities say that misappropriation took place without the report?" Hasina said in the presence of reporters. "Cases can be filed against those who have filed the case against us. Anybody can be sued this way." she said. Hasina alleged that she was being tortured mentally in many ways. bdnews24.com/pc
