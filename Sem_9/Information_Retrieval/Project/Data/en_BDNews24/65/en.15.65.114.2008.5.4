 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Sunday approved an ordinance to turn Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board into a public limited company, a government official said. Updated The cabinet approved the BTTB Amendment Ordinance 2008 at a meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, CA's press secretary Fahim Munaim told reporters. Munaim said the BTTB would be transformed into a public limited company under the ordinance which would bring changes to the BTTB Ordinance 1979. With the law coming into effect, BTTB property will be owned by the public limited company. BTTB employees will be shifted to the Plc. Employees will have an option to retire if they do not want to work anymore, the CA's press secretary said. The landing station and submarine cable will also be handed over to the Plc, Munaim said. The cabinet on March 2 approved the ordinance in principle. On October 6 last year, the cabinet asked the post and telecommunications ministry to remove inconsistencies in the proposal by November. The ministry on Oct 7 formed a five-member committee to correct the proposal. Former BTTB general manager Ziaur Rashid Safdar was the convener of the committee. About 12,000 people work for the BTTB against 19,409 posts. A German firm has been assigned to assess the property of the state-owned entity. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department had been created under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to run the telecommunication services on a commercial basis after the Liberation War in 1971. The T&T Department was converted into a corporate body in 1976. The department was restructured into Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board and mandated by an ordinance in 1979 to provide basic telecommunication services. The BTTB Ordinance of 1979 had given BTTB the monopoly rights and powers for issuing licence for telecommunications and wireless services. In 1995, the government amended the BTTB Ordinance 1979 and transferred the regulatory authority from BTTB to the telecoms ministry. According to the telecommunications policy formulated in 1998, the BTTB was meant to be restructured in two phases. bdnews
