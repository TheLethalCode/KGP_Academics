<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)- The power ministry has asked the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority to start the process to immediately activate the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC). "Initiative has been taken to make the DPDC effective. A committee has been formed for recruitment with former secretary Khawaja Golam Ahmed as its chief. I hope DPDC can be made effective soon," Power Division secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com. He said the customer service quality in the capital would improve further with an effective DPDC, formed in 2005 as part of power sector reconstruction to replace DESA. However, the DPDC could not be made effective amid howls of protests from the Power Division, especially the DESA unions. Ministry officials said once the DPDC comes into effect, the DESA area would go under DPDC that would distribute electricity in those areas. An official of the ministry, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com, "The infrastructure of the power distribution system in the DESA area needs improvement. There are faults in transformers and distribution lines in many areas of DESA. "As a result, DESA is failing to provide the service expected of it. Transformers have to be changed and new distribution lines set up. If DPDC becomes effective the work on this infrastructure development would start." Officials at the ministry said DESA had been directed to hand over resources including distribution lines to DPDC. Primarily the DESA employees would not be retrenched. For appointment in the DPDC, those now engaged in the power distribution in metropolitan area would be given priority. It means many from DESA would get jobs with the DPDC and those failing to land DPDC jobs would be given jobs elsewhere and financial benefits as well, the officials added. Appointments to several top posts including managing director, general manager and director have been made. However, the manpower structure of DPDC has not yet been drawn. The ministry would fix the manpower in line with the decision of the DPDC board. The DESA Ordinance was promulgated in 1990 for power distribution in the capital and DESA started work on October 1, 1991. It initially started work of power distribution in greater Dhaka but after the launch of DESCO and the handover of some areas to the Rural Electrification Board (REB), it now distributes power to the southern part of Dhaka, Tejgaon, Shyamoli, Dhanmondi and Narayganj town. DESA has six lakh subscribers and a over 3000-strong workforce bdnews24
