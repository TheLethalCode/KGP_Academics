<TITLE> Britain's Brown mauled in local elections </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON,May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's ruling Labour Party slumped to its worst local election defeat in 40 years on Friday, dealing a bitter blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his first test at the polls since taking over from Tony Blair. Buffeted by global economic turmoil, bedeviled by party in-fighting, he now faces an uphill climb against the resurgent Conservatives in the next parliamentary elections due in 2010. "If the economic crisis continues through 2010, Brown's dead in the water," MORI pollster Robert Worcester told Reuters. With two-thirds of the results counted from local councils in England and Wales, BBC predictions put the Conservatives on 44 percent and Labour on an ignominious 24 per cent, one point behind the centrist Liberal Democrats. The results were a damning verdict on Brown's first year in power since taking over from Tony Blair, and the poor showing could raise questions about his leadership, analysts said. But government ministers said the poll reflected a downturn in the economy caused by the worldwide credit crunch and Brown would bounce back to win the next national election. Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said: "These are disappointing results and we recognize the difficult economic context, with people feeling the pinch." Citing a new party mantra for rebranding a badly bruised Brown, she told BBC News: "We are determined to listen." The Conservatives, the once dominant party of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, were in buoyant mood after suffering a decade in the political wilderness. "The ship of state is heading towards the rocks," said Conservative local government spokesman Eric Pickles. Nick Clegg, new leader of the Liberal Democrats who could hold the balance of power if the next election produces a hung parliament, said: "It is only the second time in our history in the post-war period that we have overtaken Labour as a share of the vote." Some 4,000 seats on 160 councils across England and Wales were up for grabs in Thursday's elections. John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives fared better than expected while Labour had done even worse than the most dismal predictions. "WORST DRUBBING FOR 40 YEARS" Newspapers said Brown had been punished by voters angry over his decision to abolish the lowest income tax band. The reform triggered a Labour Party revolt that forced him to make concessions in order to avoid hurting the poor. "Brown takes a local election hammering," the Daily Telegraph said. The Guardian called it "a mauling." The Times said Labour suffered its "worst drubbing in 40 years." The former finance minister had enjoyed a brief honeymoon with voters after he took over from Blair last June. But the media and opposition accused him of dithering over calling a snap election in October -- a move he eventually decided against -- and he has also been beset by party mutinies, economic turmoil and industrial unrest. Attention now turns to London where two political mavericks are battling for the job of mayor in the closest election since the office was created eight years ago. Victory for Conservative candidate Boris Johnson in the race would be a major boost for the party's leader David Cameron. A win for incumbent Ken Livingstone would provide some relief for Brown. Turnout was expected to have been high, which pollsters said could favor Livingstone. The result is due later on Friday. "Ken Livingstone stands between Gordon Brown and ... a disaster," Curtice said.
