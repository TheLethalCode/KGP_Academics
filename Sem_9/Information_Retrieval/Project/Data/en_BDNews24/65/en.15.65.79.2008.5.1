 Dhaka, May 01 (bdnews24.com)Labour organisations across the country observed the historic May Day amid a state of emergency. As the government did not permit labour-rights campaigners to bring out processions or rallies, May Day programmes have been limited to indoor discussions. On May 1, 1886, workers of the US city Chicago had staged demonstrations near Haymarket demanding eight hours' workday instead of the 12-hour workday prevalent at that time. Police had opened fire in a bid to quell the agitation, when 10 workers got killed. But that sacrifice ultimately led to the authorities yielding to the workers' demand and the eight-hour workday came to be introduced universally. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed issued separate messages to mark the day wishing all workers prosperity and happiness. At the Muktangan at 9am Thursday, the police dispersed the May Day observance committee's rally. At 10am, committee members reassembled at Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium and condemned police action at a press conference. At 9:30am, the Jatiya Garments Worker Federation's women workers rally also had to be rushed through due to police intervention. Aminul Haque Amin, general secretary of the federation, demanded that the embargo on trade unions should be lifted immediately, the women's development policy be implemented, labour law amendment ordinance 2008 be annulled and introduction of factory-based rationing. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman in his message called upon the workers to work sincerely toward building a graft-free nation and society. A joint message issued by BNP's M Saifur Rahman, Hafizuddin Ahmed and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan greeted the workers across the country and wished them joy. Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who leads BNP's other faction, also wished everybody including the workers happiness and prosperity on the occasion. Former president AQM Badruddozza, retired major Abdul Mannan and JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu expressed their solidarity with the workers everywhere. The CA inaugurated a discussion and a three-day fair on May 1. The Dhaka metropolitan committee of Bangladesh Kalyan Party arranged a discussion at Shahjahanpur auditorium. Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies also organised May Day lectures, photography exhibition and a cultural show at the National Press Club. bdnews24.
