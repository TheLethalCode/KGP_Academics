 MADRID, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has said that he will heed club captain Raul's advice and make the fewest possible changes to the squad that won a second successive league title at the weekend. "During the celebrations Raul and (Gabriel) Heinze took me to one side and said something very sensible: 'don't destroy this team, don't destroy it' they said," Calderon told sports daily AS on Tuesday. "What they meant was that we shouldn't make too many changes. We shouldn't sell players without thinking it through carefully beforehand and we shouldn't sign players just for the sake of signing them. "We are going through a very successful period and they don't want it destroyed by bad decision making and I agree with them." Real spent around 120 million euros on eight new editions to their championship-winning squad at the end of last season. This time round they are expected to exercise their option to bring former youth team players Ruben de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi Garcia back to the club and have also been linked with Valencia striker David Villa. But Calderon effectively ruled out bids for big-name Premier League players Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas. "Right now signing Cristiano Ronaldo is a utopia. His type of player only come to Madrid if they want to. We can't force a player to sign. If he says he is leaving then we can sit down an negotiate The same is true of Cesc." Real wrapped up their second league title in a row with a dramatic 2-1 win at Osasuna on Sunday and are hoping to celebrate in front of their own fans with a victory over arch-rivals Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Wednesday
