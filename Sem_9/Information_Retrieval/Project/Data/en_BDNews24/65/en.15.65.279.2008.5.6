 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)A Bangladesh Armed Forces team will fly to Myanmar on Wednesday to hand relief to authorities in the Southeast Asian country in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. Brigadier General Taslim Uddin Khan will lead the team, the Inter-Service Public Relations Directorate said in a statement Tuesday. The team will also assist Myanmar in rescue operations. Myanmar's military government on Tuesday raised its death toll from Nargis to nearly 22,500 with a further 41,000 missing. According to the ISPR statement, the 20-member team will hand over relief to Myanmar on behalf of Bangladesh government. The relief to be carried by a TC-130 cargo plane includes potatoes, medicines, oral saline, water-purifying tablets, saris, Burmese thamis, lungis, trousers, towels and covers. After the cyclone hit Myanmar on May 3, the country called for international assistance. "Bangladesh decided to send the relief materials, responding to the call and as a neighbouring country," the ISPR Directorate said. bdnew
