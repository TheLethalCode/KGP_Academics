 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Cyclone Nargis that brewed in the Bay of Bengal bypassed Bangladesh's coasts and moved towards Myanmar Friday, according to a storm warning bulletin. The bulletin of the Storm Warning Centre of the Meteorological Department in Dhaka said the storm moved eastwards and was crossing Myanmar coast near Bassein at 6pm Friday. Nargis that intensified into a severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds Friday is expected to move in an easterly direction and complete crossing Myanmar coast by Friday night, the bulletin said. Still, the government advised coastal officials and volunteers to stay alert so that they could face any impact of the cyclone. Maximum sustained wind speed within 64km of the storm centre was about 120kph, rising to 140kph in gusts. The sea remained rough, it said. Maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been advised to keep hoisted distant warning signal number 2 (two). All fishing boats and merchant ships in the Bay of Bengal have been advised to stay anchored until further notice. The deep depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining southeast Bay turned into a cyclonic storm Nargis on Apr 28. Nargis has intensified into a severe cyclone on April 29. The weather officials had earlier said Nargis was weaker than Tropical Cyclone Sidr that killed some 3,400 people in November. bdnew
