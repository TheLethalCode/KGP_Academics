 SYDNEY, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Perth's international airport was temporarily shut on Saturday night and flights were diverted as Australian police investigated a suspicious package discovered by baggage handlers on a Malaysia Airlines plane. Police said outgoing international flights were delayed and incoming flights were either sent to other Australian cities or diverted to the airport's domestic terminals. Federal Police and a bomb squad were called after the suspicious package was discovered from incoming Flight 125. Assistant Police Commissioner John McRoberts told media that the package, addressed to an individual in Perth, was x-rayed at the airport. The airport has since been re-opened for international flights.
