 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Tropical cyclone Nargis is expected to make a landfall in Myanmar Friday night, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm system is likely to intensify further and move in an east-northeasterly direction and cross Myanmar coast, according to a special weather bulletin. Under its influence, rains or thundershowers are likely in many places with isolated heavy falls over Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the next 48 hours. In Bangladesh, the weather office Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port. River and maritime ports took cautionary steps. Six coastal districts have been put on alert. "Port authorities have taken extra caution and remained alert against the cyclone," Syed Farhad Uddin of Chittagong port told bdnews24.com. Ships at the outer anchorage have been asked to stay cautious. Small and light river vessels started anchoring on the river Karnaphuli. The authorities opened two control rooms in the port city of Chittagong. People have been asked to call 2510839 or 2510866 in case of emergency. bdnews24.com's Patuakhali correspondent said port authorities had suspended river communications from 4.00pm Thursday. Patuakhali deputy commissioner AGM Mir Mashiur Alam said the administration mounted cyclone watch. Under the peripheral influence of the storm, the low-lying areas of the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by storm surges as high as 5 feet above the normal astronomical tide, meteorologists said. bdnews24
