 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday said the government attached highest priority to establishing the fundamental rights of the workers at all levels. "The working people's contribution in the development, production and construction processes is immense. The wheels of civilisation advance while the wheels of the industries rotate, the economy thrives soaking in the sweat of the working class people toiling," he said. The interim government head made the remarks at a discussion organised by the labour and manpower ministry on the May Day at Osmany Memorial Auditorium in the capital. "Recognising this basic interdependence, we have been emphasising ensuring the fundamental rights of the workers so that the working class realises that their country appreciates that the change in the country's people and its economic wellbeing depends largely on the change of the workers' situation." "We firmly believe that it is difficult to keep the wheels of development going if the 'just' rights of the workers who are moving those wheels all the time are not ensured and established." He said the government had been working to further the working class's interests as a precondition to advancement on the road of industrialisation. To formulate the Bangladesh Labour Law 2006, a massive job of analysing, updating and synthesising 25 labour laws of the past has been accomplished, he added. The primary draft of the labour law has been prepared. "I would tell all concerned to make the law more meaningful, production- and development-friendly and workers' welfare-oriented as is the present day reality. I also request all parties to abide by the rules of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in this connection," Fakhruddin said. Delivering his chief guest's speech, the he said, "I want to tell the industry owners in clear terms that all of you will have to ensure proper and hygienic work environment, stick to specified work hours, pay just wages and incentives in time." "To the workers, I would say, you will surely remain aware of and alert about your just rights. I would also ask you not to fall prey to rumours and turn into playthings or puppets in the hands of the villains. The eventual shutdown that industries face in course of time is actually both your loss and our loss," explained the CA. "In our country, a good number of women workers are employed by the garment industries. Therefore, any labour unrest leading to closure of plants in the garment sector impact both home and abroad negatively as it amounts to repressing women," he said. "Due to the recent labour unrest and rampant factory closures, the country's image has been tarnished abroad and yours and ours attitudes came under question. I consider, you and I will have to be more cautious, behave more rationally and work towards realising the welfare of the workers." "I do not think there should be any excuse in implementing the tripartite agreement reached among the government, the owners and the workers." The chief adviser also inaugurated the May Day fair at the memorial hall. Acting labour and employment secretary Mahfuzul Haque presided over the discussion. Labour adviser Anwarul Iqbal, ILO Dhaka office director Panudda Boonpala and Employers' Federation president Kamran T Rahman also spoke. bdnews24
