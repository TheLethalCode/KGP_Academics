<TITLE> City polls in July: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Elections to city corporations and municipalities will be held in July, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said Monday. "An election schedule will be announced after the city corporation ordinance is passed," Sohul told reporters after a meeting of the Election Commission at the EC secretariat. The EC had earlier said a schedule of polls to four city corporations and seven municipalities that outlived their terms would be announced later this month. The four city corporations are Barisal, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet. The city corporation ordinance has not been published in a gazette yet. Sohul said the draft of the electoral reforms law would be sent to the law ministry soon. On political parties' reaction to the redrawing of parliament constituencies, Sohul said: "Politicians may have a say. The Election Commission has already published the draft on the re-demarcation of the constituencies." "There are options to modify the draft," he said. There are constitutional and legal obligations to redraw the borders of parliamentary seats, Sohul said. He said there was no scope to file a case over the redrawing of constituencies. "So, there is no risk of delaying the election because of cases. A gazette on delimitation is expected by June." bdnews
