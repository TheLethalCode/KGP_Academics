 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)Outgoing British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury and his weekend bridge partners have handed a destitute woman Tk 1.30 lakh, a saved amount of entry fees for the game. Amina Khatun, a widow with five children, received the money at a simple ceremony at the envoy's Baridhara home Saturday night. Choudhury used to play bridge with his friends at his home on Fridays. A player had deposited Tk 400 in entry fees each time and the amount, Tk 1.30 lakh, had been saved over the last three years. Choudhury said the money would change Amina's life for the better. bdnews
