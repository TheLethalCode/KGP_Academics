 MADRID, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this week's matches: Barcelona will be missing striker Samuel Eto'o and midfielder Deco through suspension when they take on champions Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Centre-back Gabriel Milito will also miss the game after damaging his cruciate ligament and is expected to be out of action for around six months, while Ronaldinho and Andres Iniesta are also out injured. Barca must win the game if they are to have a chance of beating Villarreal to the runners-up spot behind Real and gaining an automatic place in the Champions League group phase. Barcelona captain Carles Puyol has admitted he is upset his team will have to give arch-rivals Real Madrid the guard of honour as they run on to the pitch at the Bernabeu on Wednesday in recognition of their victory in the Spanish league. "As a Barca fan I don't like the having to clap them on to the pitch, but as a sportsman you have to recognise the champions and we will do that," the Barca defender told a news conference on Monday. "We didn't do things right this season, we weren't consistent and Real Madrid are deserving champions." Villarreal are confident they can keep Barcelona at bay in the race for second place given their four-point cushion over the Catalans with just three games to play. "The good thing is that we depend on ourselves and know that if we win there is nothing Barcelona can do to stop us," defender Diego Godin told reporters. Getafe goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri said his team's match against Almeria is the most important game of the season given that they have yet to secure their survival in the top flight. "For us the league is more important than anything else and so this game is the most important we have played," said the Argentine international. "It seems unbelievable that we still need some points to get out of this situation after what the club has achieved this season, but football is an ungrateful sport." Getafe reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and the final of the King's Cup. Valencia host Real Zaragoza in a classic relegation six-pointer at the Mestalla on Wednesday. Zaragoza, who scrambled a last-gasp 1-0 win over Deportivo Coruna on Sunday, are just a point above the drop zone, while Valencia, who were hammered 6-0 by Barca on Sunday, have only a point more than their opponents
