 LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold sank to a four-month low on Friday after the dollar jumped following better-than-expected US jobs data, but the metal rebounded when the price dipped below $850 an ounce and attracted fresh buyers, analysts said. Gold fell as low as $845 an ounce before rising to a high of $856.60. It was quoted at $853.90/854.90 at 1302 GMT against $850.25/851.65 in New York late on Thursday. "The market was sold on the figures because the dollar strengthened dramatically, but there was no follow-through selling and in fact there was some good underlying interest below the $850 level," said David Holmes, director of metals sales at Dresdner Kleinwort. "If we manage to hold above $850 on the close, then I think that's relatively positive," he added. The dollar jumped to two-month highs versus the yen and against a basket of currencies after data showed the US economy lost just 20,000 jobs in April, fewer than economists had forecast. The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-cutting cycle. It also backed a growing view that the US economic slowdown may not be as deep as some originally thought. A firmer dollar makes gold costlier for holders of other currencies and often lowers bullion demand. The metal is also generally seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation. Oil rebounded above $113 a barrel after three straight days of falls, as concerns about fresh Turkish assaults in northern Iraq outweighed worries about supplies and a firmer US dollar. Turkish warplanes launched intensive bombing raids on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq overnight on Thursday, but there were no reports about casualties or any impact on oil output from the region. "The $850 level, which is also 1980's record high, should hold. But if it is broken convincingly, then the whole precious metals complex might go down further," said Wolfgang Wrzesniok-Rossbach, head of sales at Heraeus, a German precious metals trading group. "People are perhaps looking elsewhere, such as equities. It seems gold is not the flavor of the day." Gold held in New York-listed StreetTRACKS Gold Shares XAUEXT-NYS-TT, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell to 580.45 tonnes as of Wednesday, shedding nearly 10 percent of its holdings in the last 10 days. In other markets, US gold futures rose, with the June contract GCM8 rising $2.20 an ounce to $853.10. Platinum rose to $1,870/1,880 an ounce from $1,860.50/1,880.50 late on Thursday, while palladium was up $2 at $408/413 an ounce. Silver rose to 16.24/16.30 an ounce from $16.16/16.22
