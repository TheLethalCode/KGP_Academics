 JERUSALEM, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police questioned Prime Minister Ehud Olmert under caution on Friday over money raised by a U.S. citizen for municipal and party elections in 1999 and 2002, his office said. A statement said Olmert, who has been the subject of three other corruption probes relating to his conduct in public offices before he became premier in 2006, answered investigators' questions for an hour and would continue to cooperate with law-enforcement authorities. Israeli election finance laws limit donations from abroad. Olmert's office did not say if he was suspected of illicitly using funds raised by the unnamed American. A police spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement from Olmert's office. Olmert successfully ran for re-election as Jerusalem mayor in 1999. In 2002, he ran against then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for the leadership of the right-wing Likud Party, but lost. Friday's questioning, which was ordered at unusually short notice by Israel's attorney-general, came as Olmert pursues a peace effort with the Palestinians, talks the United States hopes will culminate in an accord before January. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will arrive in the region on Saturday to help advance the talks. Olmert is already under a criminal probe into accusations he dispensed favors in return for a discount on the 2004 purchase price of a Jerusalem home. He is also being investigated over allegations that as trade minister in 2003, he appointed allies to a state business authority. Last November police concluded there was insufficient evidence to take action against him over his role in the sale of state-owned Bank Leumi when serving as finance minister. Olmert denied wrongdoing in all three cases. Asked if this was also his position regarding the suspicions that prompted Friday's police interrogation, an Olmert's spokeswoman declined comment. Earlier this year, a government-appointed commission said political and army leaders had committed "serious failings" during a war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon in 2006. The panel did not blame Olmert personally and endorsed key decisions he made.
