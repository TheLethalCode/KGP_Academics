 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juan Roman Riquelme scored an early goal to set titleholders Boca Juniors on the way to a 2-1 win over Brazil's Cruzeiro in a Libertadores Cup match marred by a missile-throwing incident on Wednesday. Other Brazilian clubs did better in third-round first-leg ties as Flamengo and Fluminense won away to America and Atletico Nacional while Sao Paulo ground out a goalless draw in Nacional's notorious Parque Centenario in Montevideo. Sao Paulo came through a bad-tempered match at a ground known for a raucous atmosphere where even the ball boys regularly cause trouble for opposing teams. Boca's win over Cruzeiro was marred when a linesman suffered a cut forehead after being struck by a missile thrown from the crowd, prompting referee Jorge Larrionda to finish the game one minute early. The incident happened in front of the stands where the most expensive seats and VIP boxes are situated, including the one used by former Argentina captain Diego Maradona. The South American Football Confederation (CSF) invariably allows results to stand in such cases, and both Argentina and Brazilian media said Boca had won although the hosts could face sanctions. Former Barcelona and Villarreal midfielder Riquelme fired Boca ahead in the sixth minute and Jesus Datolo scored a second in the 65th after cutting inside and slotting the ball in at the near post. Cruzeiro took advantage to score an away goal in the 78th minute with a long-range shot from Fabricio which took a wicked deflection. GOALKEEPER DISMISSED Flamengo won 4-2 at troubled America, who are bottom of the Mexican championship despite being widely regarded as the country's biggest club. Marcinho twice put Flamengo ahead and, although Diego Cervantes and Enrique Esqueda replied for the hosts, late goals from Diego Tardelli and Leo Moura gave Flamengo an impressive win. Argentine midfielder Dario Conca scored with a long-range goal in the 75th minute to give Fluminense a 2-1 win over Colombian champions Atletico Nacional, who played most of the game with 10 men. Atletico goalkeeper David Ospina was sent off in the 20th minute for a foul which also resulted in a penalty converted by Thiago Neves. Francisco Arrue fired the equaliser early in the second half. A controversial late penalty gave San Lorenzo a 2-1 win over River Plate in the evening's other match. Andres Silvera swept San Lorenzo ahead in the 29th minute of the all-Argentine clash and Colombian Radamel Falcao Garcia headed Diego Simeone's team level two minutes later
