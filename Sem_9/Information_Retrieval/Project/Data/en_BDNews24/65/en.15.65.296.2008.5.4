 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Six candidates Sunday bought nomination papers to contest the posts of three members in the upcoming Bangladesh Olympic Association's by-elections scheduled for May 14. They are Ahmedur Rahman, Jobayedur Rahman Rana, Sajed A Adel, Jobera Rahman Linu, Rafia Akter Dolly and Kazi Shahana Parvin. There will be contest for the posts of three general member -- one from national Olympic events (national federation), one from among Olympiads, and the rest from national women's sports association. The election commission on April 29 announced the schedules for the by-elections to fulfil three member posts, which have remained vacant even after the April 3 election. Some councillors alleged that they were not informed by the BOA office about the election. Ignoring the allegation, BOA chief executive officer retired colonel Waliullah said, "We have sent letters to all 40 national federations and six divisions on April 29, and we have nothing to do if they are not informed by their respective federations." Waliullah, however, admitted that they were yet to inform the councillors nominated by the BOA president and the sports and youth ministry, and they were contacting those councillors over the phone. The April 3 election saw only six candidates compete for four positions -- the posts of the secretary general and three members -- as the election commissioner earlier declared 29 candidates unopposed winners for the posts of the president, five vice presidents, three deputy secretaries general, treasurer and 19 members. Of the 37-member executive committee, one post of general member reserved for a member from International Olympic Committee will fall vacants.
