 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Municipal residents in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are to get mobile connectivity, nearly 15 years after cell-phone operations began in the country, according to the telecoms regulator. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Monday gave permission to mobile and private landline companies to operate their networks in the three hill districts. BTRC held a meeting with the PSTN and mobile operators at the BTRC conference room on introducing mobile and PSTN networks in the three hill districts. At the meeting chaired by BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam, operators were told to introduce mobile and PSTN networks to the municipal areas of the three hill districts such as Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati. Alam told bdnews24.com: "The decision has fulfilled the long-standing demand of the people of the hill areas who did not enjoy modern telecom facilities. The operators have been told to start work quickly." In a statement, BTRC said the meeting stressed SIM registration in the hill districts and the operators have been asked to conduct subscriber service activities themselves. After the BTRC decision, Grameenphone director (public relations) Syed Yamin Bakht told bdnews24.com: "As per government policy, the area will be quickly brought under the Grameenphone network. We want to use the same network infrastructure with other mobile operators." Warid Telecom chief executive Muneer Farooqui told bdnews24.com: "We welcome the government decision to allow mobile phone operations in CHT. Warid is ready to launch its service in the earliest possible time." Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at a discussion meeting with government officials and local elite of three hill districts in Rangamati on March 27 said that as per the long time demand of the hill people, the government had decided to introduce mobile networks only in the municipal areas of the three hill districts. bdnews
