<TITLE> Dalai Lama envoys to travel to China </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Envoys of the Dalai Lama will travel to China to meet the government over the crisis in Tibet, the government-in-exile said on Friday. "During this brief visit, the envoys will take up the urgent issue of the current crisis in the Tibetan areas," the government-in-exile said in a statement on its Web site. After a crackdown on protests against Chinese rule in Tibet, an international diplomatic chorus earlier this year urged dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Beijing abruptly announced in late April that it intended to meet his aides. The envoys are due to arrive in China on Saturday for what the Tibetan side called "informal talks". "We are hopeful that the Chinese are willing to address the Tibet issue realistically," Tenzin Taklha, a spokesman of the Dalai Lama, told Reuters from India, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based. Despite the offer of talks, China has accused Tibet's exiled spiritual leader of manipulating opinion and governments in the West. China has blamed the exiled Buddhist leader's "clique" for unrest across Lhasa and other Tibetan areas, which it says was aimed at upstaging the Beijing Olympic Games in August.
