 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian striker Ronaldo's sponsorship contracts will not be affected by the alleged incident involving the AC Milan player and three transvestites, his spokesman said on Wednesday. "The recent events which involved Ronaldo are personal and do not put at risk any of the forward's publicity contracts with his sponsors, nor give them grounds to cancel the contracts," said a statement on the player's Web site (www.ronaldo.com). Ronaldo's agent Fabiano Farah was quoted as saying: "For a contract to be cancelled, Ronaldo has to be publicly condemned. But he hasn't committed any crime, nor broken any law. "On the contrary. He is the only victim in the case." Police say Ronaldo, who is recovering from a serious knee injury, was involved in an altercation with three transvestites late on Sunday in the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood of Barra da Tijuca. The transvestites and Ronaldo were all interviewed by police on Monday. Nobody has been charged but police detective Carlos Augusto Nogueira said one of the transvestites, known as Andreia, may be charged with trying to extort money from Ronaldo and stealing his driving licence. Ronaldo, 31, suffered a career-threatening knee injury during a Serie A game against Livorno in February. The three-times World Player of the Year has since said he is determined to resume his career. Ronaldo, who has not played for Brazil since the 2006 World Cup, is undergoing three sessions of physiotherapy a day. His recovery is expected to take at least another seven months
