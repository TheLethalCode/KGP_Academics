 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Outgoing British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury Monday met with acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman. "This is a farewell call. We discussed many things. The current state, concerns and hopes and the forthcoming elections," Choudhury told bdnews24.com after the meeting at Rahman's Gulshan home. Rahman told reporters that he had discussed the Awami League's demand for the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina with Choudhury. "Our first demand is the release of Sheikh Hasina and the second is an end to the state of emergency, the third is an election date and the fourth is price control," Rahman said. "We raised the demands for the government through the high commissioner and he assured that he would try to help us in this regard," he said. Rahman however ducked a question on how the British high commissioner would help them in fulfilling the demands. Choudhury will leave Dhaka in the third week of May. bdnews24.
