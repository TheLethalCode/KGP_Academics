China launched a nationwide crackdown on child slave labor last year and state media reported this week that thousands of children from Sichuan had been sold into slavery to work in more prosperous areas such southern China's booming Guangdong Province. The probe has so far extended to 3,629 enterprises involving 450,000 individuals, Xinhua said. On Wednesday, the Hong-Kong based Wen Wei Po newspaper said 167 village children sold to work as slave laborers in southern China's booming Guangdong Province had been rescued by police. China's crackdown on slavery and child labor followed reports that poor farmers, children and mentally disabled people had been forced to work in kilns and mines in northern China's Shanxi and Henan Provinces
