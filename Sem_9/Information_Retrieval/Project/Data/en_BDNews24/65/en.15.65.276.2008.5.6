<TITLE> Obama, Clinton face new tests in White House duel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Tue May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton faced a crucial day in their grueling White House fight on Tuesday, as millions of voters in Indiana and North Carolina cast ballots in the latest Democratic showdowns. The two states, with a combined 187 delegates to the August nominating convention at stake, are the biggest prizes remaining in the tight race to see who will be the party's candidate in the November presidential election. After Tuesday, only six of the state-by-state contests will be left. Obama, who many analysts believed could split the day by winning North Carolina and losing Indiana, declared to reporters as he ate an omelet in Greenwood, Indiana: "I feel good." "I think it's going to be close. I don't think anybody really knows exactly what's going to happen. ... I'm seeing a lot of enthusiasm among the voters. People are just really engaged and excited about this campaign and this process," he said. Twin losses could be disastrous for Clinton, who would be the first female US president. The New York senator and former first lady has cut Obama's advantage in North Carolina to single digits in most polls over the past few weeks. The two run closer in Indiana, where Clinton has a slight edge. "Obviously we hope to do as well as we can, but, you know, we started out pretty far behind," she told reporters on her campaign plane late on Monday. "I never feel confident; I just try to do the best I can." Her campaign chairman, Terry McAuliffe, predicted on MSNBC -- when pressed -- that Clinton would win Indiana. "And I think we're closing very fast in North Carolina," he said. Polls in both states opened by 7 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) and were scheduled to close in Indiana at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) and in North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), with results expected soon afterward. OBAMA LEADS, HAD ROUGH PATCH Obama, an Illinois senator, has an almost unassailable lead in pledged delegates who will help select the Democratic nominee to face Republican John McCain in November. If Obama wins in both Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday, it would end Clinton's slender hopes of overtaking him in either delegates or popular votes won in the nomination battle and spark renewed calls for her to step aside. Clinton victories in both states could fuel doubts about Obama's electability and persuade some superdelegates -- party insiders free to back any candidate at the nominating convention -- to move toward her. Neither can win enough delegates to clinch the race before voting ends on June 3, leaving the decision to the nearly 800 superdelegates. A split decision would leave the race largely unchanged before the last six contests, with 217 delegates at stake. Obama has struggled through a rough campaign stretch after last month's loss to Clinton in Pennsylvania, dogged by a furor over his comments on "bitter" small-town residents and a controversy over his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama, who would be the first black US president, has been backed by nine out of 10 black voters in other states, and is expected to benefit from a strong turnout in North Carolina, where African-Americans could make up more than one-third of those casting ballots in the Democratic primary
