 LONDON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The England and Wales Cricket Board released the dates for Australia's 2009 tour on Monday, including the five Ashes tests, a seven-game, one-day series and two Twenty20 internationals. The schedule includes Australia's first one-day international at Hampshire's Rose Bowl in Southampton and two Twenty20 matches at Old Trafford, Manchester. The first test will be played at Cardiff's Sophia Gardens, the first time the venue has hosted test cricket, starting on Wednesday July 8 instead of the more usual Thursday start. Further tests are to be played at Lord's, Edgbaston, Headingley and the Oval. "The summer of 2009 promises to be one of the most exciting in the history of cricket in England and Wales," David Collier, the ECB chief executive said in a statement. "The Ashes series and the NatWest series along with the International Twenty20 matches have the potential for providing the sort of wonderful cricket which can fire the nation's imagination. "And of course all this follows the ICC World Twenty20 which guarantees that all the best Twenty20 players in the world will be in this country in June 2009." In 2005 England won the Ashes for the first time in 18 years after a thrilling series but were whitewashed 5-0 in Australia in the 2006/07 series.
