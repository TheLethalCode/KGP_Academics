 LONDON, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steve Harmison is likely to quit cricket if he fails to win back his England place, the fast bowler said on Sunday. The Durham paceman was dropped after England lost the first test in New Zealand in March and in his absence the team won two matches in a row to take the series 2-1. "The prospect of playing for England is what drives me and if I felt my chance of doing that was gone the probability is I'd retire from first-class cricket altogether," Harmison told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. "This is not an ultimatum or me trying to impose conditions on anyone. But I am 29 now and if I felt my England career was over I would be tempted to say I want to do something different with my life." Although Harmison retired from one-day internationals in 2006, he is desperate to add to his haul of 212 test wickets. "I am absolutely determined to show I have something to offer England," he said. "I certainly do not believe I am finished. "After a terrible year for me on the field with injuries, operations and so little cricket it is ridiculous, my aim is to bowl fast, take wickets and give the selectors something to think about." England open the three-match home series against New Zealand with the first test at Lord's starting on May 15
