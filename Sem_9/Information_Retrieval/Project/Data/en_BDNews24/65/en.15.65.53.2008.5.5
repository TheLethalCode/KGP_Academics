 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's hope to qualify for the finals of the AFC Challenge Cup was shaken Monday when they played a goalless draw against Afghanistan in the Group C qualifying opener in Kyrgyzstan. Bangladesh even conceded a goal in the 68th minute, but it was ruled out due to off-side at Spartak Stadium in Bishkek, according to a message received by the Bangladesh Football Federation. Bangladesh were reduced to 10 men in the dying minutes as defender Mofazzal Hossain Saikat left the field following a second booking. Earlier, Bangladesh had played two matches against Afghanistan and beat them 4-2 and drew 2-2 in the continental qualifiers in 1979, according to FIFA website. Besides, Bangladesh Under-23 side also drew against their Afghan counterparts in the SAFF Games in Pakistan in 2003. Bangladesh will play their last match against hosts Kyrgyzstan on March 9. Bangladesh squad: Aminul Haq, Hasan-Al-Mamun (Cap), Wali Faisal, Rajani Kanta Barman, Arup Kumar Baidya, Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, Arman Aziz, Enamul Haque Sharif (Mamunul Islam), Zahed Parvez Chowdhury, Mehdi Hassan Ujjal, Jahid Hasan Emeli.
