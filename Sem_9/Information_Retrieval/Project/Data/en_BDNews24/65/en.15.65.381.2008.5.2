<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League Friday asked the Election Commission to reverse a plan to redraw parliamentary constituencies. After a presidium meeting at AL acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home, acing general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said the party formed a three-member committee to find if there was any conspiracy behind the re-demarcation plan. The committee will submit its report in two weeks. "The Awami League is not against the delimitation of the election constituencies. But the way the commission has planned to do it will hamper the election roadmap," the AL leader said. "The Election Commission is already three months behind schedule to implement the roadmap. Re-demarcation may further delay the election." EC's move created doubt among people, he said. The EC had earlier proposed to demarcate 50 constituencies, but is now saying it will redraw the borders of 133, Ashraful said. The AL will seek permission from the government Saturday to hold a symbolic hunger strike on May 5 to drum up support for demand for the release of detained party chief Sheikh Hasina. "If the government doesn't give permission, we will take a decision at a presidium meeting later," he said. bdnews
