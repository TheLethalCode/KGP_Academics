 BRISBANE, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Shaun Tait was back training with the Australian cricket team on Monday, three months after walking away from the sport with depression. Tait was a surprise inclusion at the 15-man Test squad's five-day training camp in Brisbane to prepare for the team's tour of the West Indies starting later this month.
