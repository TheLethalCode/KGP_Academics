<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh begin their the AFC Challenge Cup's qualifying campaign Monday against Afghanistan in the three-nation Group C opener at Seater Spartak Stadium in Kyrgyzstan. The match starts in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, at 5:30pm Bangladesh standard time. Hosts Kyrgyzstan are rated top favourites in the meet after Laos pulled out of the race on Friday, and all focus are on the match between Bangladesh and the hosts. The two renew their rivalry on May 9 after the Nehru Cup last August in India where the Central Asian nation won convincingly 3-0. Despite that thrashing, newly appointed Bangladesh coach Abu Yusuf was confident about his team's chances. "We have played before against Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan and their level is the same as ours," Yousuf was quoted as saying by the the-afc.com, the official website of the Asian Football Confederation. "Sometimes you might not play good, might not understand your partners, but this time we understand each other well, and I hope with our good planning we can win," said former Bangladesh international. Bangladesh lost in the quarter-finals of the inaugural AFC Championship in Dhaka. With a FIFA ranking of as low as 196, Afghanistan are the least fancied of the three teams to make the cut but their German coach Klaus Staerk was optimistic of a decent show in the Kyrgyz capital. "We have to show our best performance and everything will be fine," said the German who led the Afghans in the opening edition of the tournament in Dhaka where they finished at the bottom of their group with two draws. "If we lose then it is still not a problem but we expect to perform to the best of our ability," Staerk was quoted by the the-afc.com as saying. Bangladesh has so far played two matches against Afghanistan and beat them 4-2 and drew 2-2 in the continental qualifiers in 1979, according to FIFA website. Besides, Bangladesh Under-23 side drew against their Afghan counterparts in the SAFF Games in Pakistan in 2003. The champions from four groups will join direct qualifiers with North Korea, Turkmenistan, hosts India and Myanmar in the eight-team finals, scheduled for July 30 to August 10 in Hyderabad, India. b
