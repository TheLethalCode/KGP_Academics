<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Tuesday his party would announce a protest programme soon to mount pressure on the government to release party chairperson Khaleda Zia from prison. Condemning the submission of separate chargesheets against the former prime minister and her son Tarique Rahman Tuesday, Delwar demanded immediate withdrawal of the cases, which said were false. "I will soon roll out a programme in discussion with the leaders of the party," said the secretary general of the faction. In a press briefing on the Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat, Dlewar alleged: "The Niko case against Khaleda Zia is fabricated, false and motivated." "The case has been filed to bar the leaders from contesting the elections. The people will never accept any farcical and arranged election," he said. "All the cases are part of a blueprint." Alleging intimidation by an unnamed quarter, Delwar said: "I am in panic. But no threat can take me away from my commitment to the party and its chief. I will continue to discharge my responsibility." On the chargesheet, the acting secretary general of BNP's pro-reform faction, Hafizuddin Ahmed told reporters: "The case is on trial. We hope Khaleda Zia will get freedom through justice." Earlier outgoing UK high commissioner Anwar Choudhury met with Hafizuddin at his Banani home. The BNP chairperson's adviser AHM Mofazzal Karim was present. They exchanged views on election, dialogue and reform. bdnew
