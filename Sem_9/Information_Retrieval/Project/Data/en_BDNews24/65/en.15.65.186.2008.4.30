 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh moved into the semifinals of the Clico International U/15 Cricket Championship with a fine 5-wicket win over Ireland Tuesday in Trinidad, the West Indies. Didar Hossain and Rakin Ahmed struck unbeaten 61 and 48 as Bangladesh reached 142 for five in 31.5 overs in reply to Ireland's 140 all out in 48 overs. Ireland, led by Hugo MacDonnell's 53, looked well on course for a decent score as they reached 77 for 1 but lost their way in face of superb bowling from Nazeef Ahmed and were wrapped up for 140. Nazeef claimed five wickets for 18 to cause the main damage in Ireland's innings and was adjudged man of the match. Asif chipped in with two for 18. Bangladesh will play Pakistan in the semifinal.
