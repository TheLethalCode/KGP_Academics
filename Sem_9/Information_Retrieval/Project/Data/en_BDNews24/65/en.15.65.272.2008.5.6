 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has reset the next hearing for May 12 in a graft case against Sheikh Hasina involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, re-fixed the date Tuesday after hearing a plea to withdraw all charges against former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, another accused in the case. Hasina was taken from special jail to court around 9:45am. The court on April 30 wrapped up the hearing on a similar plea by Hasina to quash the charges against her. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2 last year against eight people, including Hasina. The graft watchdog accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews
