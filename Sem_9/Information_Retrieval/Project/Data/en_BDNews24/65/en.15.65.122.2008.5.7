<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court is set to deliver a verdict Thursday on a government appeal against the High Court verdict that scrapped a graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A full bench of chief justice Md Ruhul Amin will deliver the verdict. The appeal tops Thursday's work list of the Appellate Division. The court wrapped up the hearing into the appeal on April 29 in the case, filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. The appeals court on Feb 26 granted the government permission for a formal appeal against the HC verdict and put freezes on the judgement. The HC scrapped the case on Feb 6. Azam filed the case against Hasina and Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim on June 13 last year with Gulshan Police Station accusing them of extorting approximately Tk 3 crore from him. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana had also been implicated in the case later. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 at Sudha Sadan in Dhanmondi and showed her arrested in the case bringing it under emergency powers rules. bdnew
