 Moulvibazar, May 2 (bdnews24.com) - Some environmental organisations Friday formed a human chain wearing black badges in protest against a three-dimensional survey by US energy firm Chevron in Lauachhara reserved forests. They demanded an immediate end to the survey and an investigation into the damage the survey caused to the forests. Their demands include punishment to those responsible for the damage and compensation to the affected people. The human chain was formed at 11.30am for half an hour at the Lauachhara national garden at Kamalganj upazila in Moulvibazar. Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, known as BAPA, Sylhet Paribesh Andolon abbreviated as SYPA, Moulvibazar Paribesh Andolon, and Habiganj Paribesh Andolon organised the protest. Magurchhara Gas Resources Destruction Compensation Realisation National Committee and Bangladesh Human Rights Implementation Association joined hands with the protesters. During the protest, Moulvibazar Paribesh Andolon general secretary Shah Akhlaqur Ambia alleged that Chevron's survey had caused various environmental and social crises in Lauachhara. BAPA joint secretary Sharif Jamil told bdnews24.com: "Environmental organisationas feared huge loss to bio diversity in Lauachhara due to Chevron's survey and demanded an end to the survey. But the department of environment permits Chevron to conduct a 3-D seismic survey there ignoring our request." He said giving permission to Chevron was against the existing national water policy, national tourism policy, environment protection rules, Bangladesh environment protection law, Wild Life Protection (Amended) Ordinance, Forest Act, national energy policy and UN-announced International Biodiversity Charter. BAPA demanded that traffic through Lauachhara forest be stopped and the rail line be shifted Shah Akhlaqur Ambia said: "There were explosions in the wells dug in the earth one week before the survey started." "Explosions had created cracks in many houses in adjoining villages." bdnews2
