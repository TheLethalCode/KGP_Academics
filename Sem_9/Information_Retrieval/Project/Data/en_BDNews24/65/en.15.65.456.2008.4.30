 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Grameenphone may list on the capital market by the third quarter of this year, said the CEO of the country's largest mobile operator, Anders Jensen, Wednesday. But the listing depends on a decision of the shareholders of the company, Jensen said while announcing the company's first-quarter financial results at a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel. The subscriber base grew from 16.5 million at the end of last year to 17.8 million in the Q1 (January-March). The subscriber base stands at more than 18 million (if the April figure is taken into account). Total revenue grew to Tk 14.9 billion (Tk 1,490 crore) in the first quarter from the quarter-earlier figure of Tk 14.3 billion. The company that boasts "innovative products and services" recorded annual revenue at Tk 54.4 billion in 2007. "Along with fresh investments of Tk 5.6 billion in the first quarter, the cumulative investments now stand at Tk 117.4 billion including the largest single-year capital expenditure of Tk 35.8 billion last year," the GP said in a statement. "This has enabled Grameenphone to build the largest network with the widest coverage in the country, bringing more than 98 percent of the population under its network coverage," it said. The GP network has more than 10,600 base stations in over 6,100 locations around the country. GP has launched a "brand repositioning campaign" with a slogan "Stay Close". The GP CEO noted that the company was "committed to making its services affordable to a much larger segment of the population, both in urban and rural areas, while maintaining the premium quality, always its brand image". At the end of the first quarter, GP's estimated market share was 46 percent. Chief financial officer Arif Al Islam and public relations director Syed Yamin Bakht also attended the press conference. bdn
