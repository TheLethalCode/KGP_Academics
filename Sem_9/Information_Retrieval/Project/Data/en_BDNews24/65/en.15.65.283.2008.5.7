 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Agriculture adviser CS Karim has recommended increasing potato intake in food menu instead of changing the food habit. "Potato production has seen a great success this year. This year the growth of potatoes has been recorded at 60 percent," the adviser said Wednesday in his speech to the inauguration of a three-day national campaign for people to increase potato intake. CSD (Canteen Stores Department) Bangladesh and Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations have organised the campaign from Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. Asia produces half of the world's potatoes, with Bangladesh accounting for up to 3 percent of total output. Army chief Moeen U Ahmed, who was the special guest at the programme, said: "Stand beside 2.50 crore farmers who grow food for 15 crore people." "The country generally faces rice shortage in March and April when potato is harvested. If we increase potato consumption this time it will reduce pressure on rice," General Moeen said. "Bangladesh faces different natural disasters every year. We witnessed six natural disasters last year, including two back-to-back floods, cyclone Sidr, rising food costs and petroleum price hikes on the international market and bird flu," he said. "The current year is a good year for Bangladesh as the country has seen bumper production of crops," the army chief said. To the opponents of the campaign Moeen said: "I ask those who oppose the potato campaign to give suggestions on how to store or preserve more-than-needed potatoes." The army chief said the United Nations had urged the world population to increase potato consumption, declaring 2008 as World Potato Year, as potato production is higher this year the world over. Bangladesh responded to the call of the UN and launched its campaign, he said. AD Spijkers, FAO's Bangladesh representative, said: "We have a major opportunity to introduce potato in rotation with cereal crops  to meet food security." bdnews24.
