 TOKYO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese referee has been accused by a player of using abusive language, including telling him to "die", during a J-League match. Oita Trinita's Taikai Uemoto said referee Yuichi Nishimura had also verbally abused him after the game when Uemoto said he would report the incident, Japanese media reported on Wednesday. The club confirmed they were compiling a file to send to Japanese officials, who have promised to launch an inquiry. Trouble flared when Uemoto asked Nishimura why he had not booked an FC Tokyo player for a foul late in the second half of Tuesday's game. Japanese media reported that several players overheard a furious Nishimura snap back: "Shut up! You keep quiet and get on with the game. Die!" Uemoto said Nishimura had made similar remarks and threatened to book him after the game. "I was shocked," he told Japan's Nikkan Sports daily. "If players said the same thing we'd be sent off. We don't have cards but that ref deserved a red. He was totally out of order." Japanese officials are likely to take a dim view of the incident which comes days after a Kashiwa Reysol player was banned for four games for shoving a referee. "We are taking this matter very seriously," Japan Football Association (JFA) general secretary Kozo Tashima said. "We will decide on what measures to take after a proper investigation.
