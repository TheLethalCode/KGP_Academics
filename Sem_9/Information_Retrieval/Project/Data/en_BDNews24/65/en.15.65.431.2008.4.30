 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Wednesday the use of information technology could strengthen the anti-graft movement. "We will be able to strengthen our position against corruption through information technology," Chowdhury said when he launched a website from a ceremony at the Jatiya Press Club. Concern for Environmental Development and Research, a nongovernmental organisation, designed the website www.nocorruptionbd.org to create public awareness against graft. Kazi Sher Mohammad, president of the CEDAR, said that visitors would be able to express their opinions through the website. CEDAR that began in 1989 is the brainchild of a group of university post-graduates. bdnews
