<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday asked the Supreme Court Bar Association election authorities to explain why the secretary post would not be barred on a temporary basis. Judge Iftekhar Ahmed passed the ruling and asked newly elected secretary Nurul Islam Sujan and 10 members of the election subcommittee of the SCBA to explain in three days from now. Earlier, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, a contestant for the post of SCBA secretary, filed a case with the trial court against Sujan, seeking restrictions on the post. According to case details, the subcommittee responsible for the SCBA polls had declared Mamun elected on the night of April 29. After the recounting of votes on April 30, the committee, however, declared Sujan a winner. In his appeal, Mamun urged the trial court to declare him the legal secretary. bdnews24
