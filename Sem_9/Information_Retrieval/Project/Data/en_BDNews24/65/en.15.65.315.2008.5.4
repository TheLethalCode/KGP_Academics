 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League observes a mass hunger strike programme in the capital Monday to put pressure on the government to release party chief Sheikh Hasina and send her to the US for treatment. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Sunday said they were putting final touches to the preparation for the programme. The six-hour hunger strike would be held simultaneously at the AL headquarters on the Bangabandhu Avenue and at the party president's political office at Dhanmondi from 10am to 4pm. Hasina, the former prime minister detained on corruption charges early last year, has been suffering from various health complications and treated in Dhaka several times. Her party insists on her being sent to the US for better treatment. Ashraful said the central working committee of the party will meet after the mass hunger strike to decide on the next programme. He went to the Dhanmondi office in the morning and directed party's deputy publicity and publication secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil and deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haque to prepare for the programme. Ukil told bdnews24.com that the central leaders would stay in two big rooms in the Dhanmondi office during the programme, while Mohila Awami League and Jubo Mohila League will stay on the premises outside the office. The leaders and workers of the party's Dhaka city unit and front organisations will stay at the central office on the Bangabandhu Avenue. A token hunger strike throughout the country for April 29 was announced from the AL presidium meeting on April 23. But the government did not give it the go-ahead to hold the programme and the presidium at another meeting on April 27 decided to observe the programme only in Dhaka city and pushed the date to May 5. The AL wrote to Dhaka Metropolitan Police Saturday to take measures for the programme. Later in the day, after the presidium meeting, Ashraful told journalists that they had got permission to hold the programme on May 5. bdnews
