<TEXT>
 Wed Apr 30, NEW YORK (Reuters Life!/bdnews24.com) - Actress Kate Hudson graces the cover of People magazine this week for the release of its "100 Most Beautiful People" list, but the single mother said she does not spend a lot of money on how she looks. Hudson, 29, daughter of actress Goldie Hawn, told the magazine that she can't remember the last time she had a manicure or a facial. "I don't do those kinds of things. And when I do, I always think, 'I should do this more often,'" she said. Joining her on the list, which People said is not ranked, are teen queens Miley Cyrus, of "Hannah Montana" fame, and "High School Musical" star Vanessa Hudgens, who have both been criticized for appearing in sexy or nude photographs. "Just recently I've learned to be okay with myself without wearing makeup," said Hudgens, whose image took a battering when nude pictures of her appeared on the Internet last year. New moms Isla Fisher, Salma Hayek, Jennifer Lopez and Halle Berry -- on the list for the 12th time -- are named, along with mothers-to-be Jessica Alba, Angelina Jolie, making her sixth appearance, and Nicole Kidman, named for the ninth time. Jolie's partner Brad Pitt is named for the eighth time, along with George Clooney, while Matthew McConaughey makes it for the fifth time. From the music business, Carrie Underwood, Mary J. Blige, Norah Jones and Josh Groban are considered among the most beautiful, while from television Tina Fey, Vanessa Williams, Mariska Hargitay and Marcia Cross make the list. "I feel more beautiful when I see the pictures after. I'm like, 'I wish I had felt like I looked like that when I was actually there,'" Underwood, 25, said.
