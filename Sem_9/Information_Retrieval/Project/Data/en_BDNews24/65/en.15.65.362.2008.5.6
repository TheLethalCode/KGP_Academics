 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI), a national trade policy think-tank in public-private partnership, restarted its activities Tuesday. Corrected Former Tariff Commission chairman and Dhaka University teacher Prof MA Taslim has been appointed CEO of the BFTI. The "symbiotic" organisation that interfaces public and private endeavours had failed to attain its objectives since its birth in late 2003. Trade expert Mustafa Abid Khan has been appointed a research fellow of the BFTI. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman made the disclosure at a press conference Tuesday after he chaired the 22nd meeting of its board of directors at the TCB building in Karwan Bazar. Rahman said the BFTI with assistance from the European Commission would become an internationally reputed institute for trade policy research and a centre of excellence for education and training of the highest standards. "It will be tough to sustain in the age of globalisation without research information. Considering this issue, we have taken the initiative to reshuffle the organisation. BFTI will help the government as well as the private sector with the knowledge of research," he said. Rahman said: "Bangladesh has changed a lot. We want to be more a trade- dependent than an aid-dependent country. Because of this, we are paying attention to the increase of exports and imports in the world market and doing research for new markets. He expressed the hope that BFTI would grow to be a leading research institute in no time. Others present at the press conference were commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed (vice-chairman of BFTI), FBCCI president Annisul Huq (vice-chairman), MA Taslim (member secretary/CEO), BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury (member) and BTMA chairman Abdul Hye Sarkar (member). The adviser said that the EC would provide 7.5 million euros while the government would provide 0.7 million euros. "Research activity of the BFTI will increase thanks to MA Taslim and Mustafa Abid Khan," he said. Taslim said, "BFTI will supply necessary data to the public and private sectors so that they could work together and create a bridge for development of trade. "This kind of initiative is the first in the country and Bangladesh will very soon benefit from it," he said. Firoz Ahmed said: "Though this organisation will initially run with financial grants from the EC and the government, it will eventually conduct its activities with its own earnings." Taslim is also a member of the Bangladesh Better Business Forum, headed by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. bdnews24.c
