 Dhaka, May 02 (bdnews24.com)Labour and employment adviser Anwarul Iqbal Friday called on knitwear manufacturers to set up labour-friendly factories and increase facilities for workers. "Workers would have helped take the industry forward with more enthusiasm if the factories had been labour-friendly," the adviser said at a seminar on "export growth and compliance: the case of Bangladesh knitwear sector". Adviser Anwarul Iqbal said the government would offer all-out support to set up labour-friendly factories. The government had earlier asked Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) and Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) to increase facilities for workers. "The government will take steps in this regard too," the adviser said. One million people, 70 percent of them women, work in the knitwear sector under direct employment and five million under indirect employment, BKMEA vice president MA Baset said. Iqbal stressed the need for launching a rationing system for knitwear workers as the spiralling prices of commodities hit hard the low-income group. BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said the association would start a rationing system Monday. In the initial stage, the rationing programme would work in Fatullah in Narayanganj and BISIC industrial area. He said the BKMEA would revise worker wages in a couple of months. Baset, who presented a paper on export growth, said the knitwear sector of Bangladesh, grabbed the biggest pie of Bangladesh exports with an average growth rate of 20 percent in the last 10 years. The knitwear export earned the country $3.47 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, he said. Readymade garments contributed $9.12 billion or 75.64 percent in the national export earnings in fiscal 2006-07 and $6.76 billion or 76.23 percent in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, Baset said. The labour and employment ministry and BKMEA organised the seminar at Osmani Memorial Hall. Baset said the BKMEA was working hard for further development of compliance issues of this sector. bdnews
