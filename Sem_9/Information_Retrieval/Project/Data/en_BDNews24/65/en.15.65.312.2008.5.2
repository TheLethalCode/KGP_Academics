<TITLE> Olympic torch draws mass support, protest in Hong Kong </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, May 2 (Reuters) - The Olympic torch was run through Hong Kong on Friday in a festive return to China after a troubled world tour, but tensions flared as patriotic crowds heckled protesters and police briefly detained eight activists. Security around the flame was tight on Friday, with roads closed, crowds kept at a distance, and at times as many as 16 Chinese torch security guards in blue and white track suits and police on motorcycles alongside the torch bearers. All along the torch's route, tens of thousands of cheering citizens packed sidewalks and strained for a glimpse of the flame as it winded its way across the territory by foot, dragon boat and horseback, as well as by yacht across the city's iconic harbour. Despite the outpouring of support, small bands of demonstrators confined to protest pens along the route demanded Beijing honour its Olympics human rights promises, but were confronted at times by bristling crowds. Early in the day, torch supporters surrounded and shouted profanity at a small group of demonstrators calling for religious freedom and brandishing a Tibetan flag. Police tried to prevent them from raising the flag and led the eight protesters to a van, along with a Chinese man who'd tried to snatch away their flag. They were later released and told they had been taken away for their own safety. "It was a very dirty trick because I think it was a political decision to remove us 10 minutes before the torch got there," Christina Chan, one of the protesters told Reuters. Another lone elderly protester holding a placard urging dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama was circled by shouting bystanders who tore his clothing, called him a traitor and said he was "mentally sick". "I was just expressing my opinion. What right do they have to treat me like this? They are uncivilised!" said the man, 72-year-old cab driver Ng Pun-tuk. SOLEMN HONOUR Authorities in the former British colony have drawn criticism for taking an uncharacteristically tough line including blocking several people from entering the city, among them three pro-Tibet campaigners and a Danish artist and rights activist. The torch's five-continent journey has been dogged by protests, mostly over China's human rights record and Tibet, which have deeply embarrassed Beijing and provoked retaliatory rallies at home and abroad by patriotic Chinese. "It is a great and solemn honour for Hong Kong, Asia's world city, to welcome back the Olympic flame on behalf of our proud nation," Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang said at the relay's start. A march by a pro-democracy group which holds an annual commemoration for the Tiananmen square crackdown in Beijing in 1989, was shadowed every step of the way by crowds of chanting Olympics supporters who tried to slow their progress. Elsewhere, Chinese university students waved national flags in front of protesters' banners, and shouted and sang the national anthem to try to drown out the calls for democracy. "We are here peacefully to express our ideals that we love China and the motherland," said one, named Yu Xiang. Many expect the flame to now have a smooth run on Chinese soil with the possible exception of its Tibet leg in mid-June, leading up to the Aug. 8 opening ceremony in Beijing. In the United States, conservative and liberal members of Congress joined forces to urge a U.S. government boycott of the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Games, which start in August, accusing China of gross human rights violations. American actress Mia Farrow entered Hong Kong on Thursday to call on China to do more to end the violence in the troubled Darfur region of Sudan. She was questioned by immigration authorities before being allowed into the city and was told torch relay disruptions would not be welcome. After giving a speech in Hong Kong critical of Beijing's Sudan-friendly policy, Farrow lit a symbolic "torch against genocide" on Friday outside Hong Kong's government headquarters, calling on China to end the current genocide in Darfur. After Hong Kong, the torch goes to the Chinese gambling hub Macau and then starts its journey through the mainland. A sister flame is awaiting good weather to summit Mt. Everes
