<TITLE> Climate experts blame Nargis on big polluters </TITLE>

 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The New Delhi-based Centre for Environment and Science says tropical cyclones Nargis and Sidr are the results of climate change. Nargis hit Myanmar on May 3, killing more than 25,000 people with a further 40,000 still missing. Sidr slammed into the southern Bangladesh on November 15 last year, claiming about 3,500 people. "While we can never pinpoint one disaster as the result of climate change, there is enough scientific evidence that climate change will lead to intensification of tropical cyclones," CSE's director Sunita Narain said in a statement Wednesday. "Nargis is a sign of things to come. Last year, Bangladesh was devastated by the tropical cyclone Sidr. "The victims of these cyclones are climate change victims and their plight should remind the rich world that it is doing too little to contain its greenhouse gas emissions," Narain added. The 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had clearly observed that cyclones will increase in their intensity as a result of global warming. "There is observational evidence of an increase of intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, correlated with increases of tropical sea surface temperatures," the CSE said quoting IPCC. "The IPCC also notes based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases of tropical sea surface temperatures." Big polluters responsible for these deaths and devastation, said Mario D'Souza, CSE's climate change researcher, in the statement. "The voices of the victims of climate change must be heard. Like the tropical cyclone Sidr, which ripped through Bangladesh in 2007, the Nargis has also left thousands dead and homeless." "This devastation happened because the rich failed to contain emissions necessary for their growth", said Mario D'Souza Emissions and lifestyles are now spelling doom for countries such as Myanmar and Bangladeshand the big polluters of the world, such as the US, cannot escape their responsibility and role in the 'dance of death' of tropical cyclones like Nargis, said the CSE. "The question that the world needs to answer now is, how to make these countries pay for the victims of climate change," Narain said. bdn
