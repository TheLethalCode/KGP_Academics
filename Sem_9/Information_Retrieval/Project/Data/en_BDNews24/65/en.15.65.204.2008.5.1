 Dhaka, May 01 (bdnews24.com)The weather office Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port as cyclone Nargis moved further in, a weather official said. Arjumand Habib, director of the Met office, told bdnews24.com that the cyclone was likely to cut its path through Myanmar coasts. The severe cyclonic storm over the east central Bay and adjoining west central Bay moved northeastwards over the same area and was centred about 765km south-southwest of Chittagong port, 685km south-southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 705km south of Mongla port. "It is likely to intensify further and move in a northeasterly direction," the Meteorological Department said in its midday bulletin. Under the peripheral influence of the storm, the low-lying areas of the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by storm surges as high as 5 feet above the normal astronomical tide. All fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay have been advised to take shelter immediately. bdnews
