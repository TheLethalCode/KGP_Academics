 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Zia International Airport was closed for about two hours Sunday after a Bangladesh Biman aircraft skidded off the runway on landing, an official said. Updated No injuries were reported. Airport operations resumed shortly after 9.00pm. Aviation authorities had suspended operations at the airport from 7.10pm, delaying outgoing and incoming flights. A flight of Emirates from Dubai failed to land at the airport Friday evening. "Nobody was hurt after the plane went out of control. But the runway was closed," ZIA director Wing Commander Saidul Hasan told bdnews24.com. The aircraft was taken to the hangar at about 9.00pm, said Khan Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain, deputy general manager (public relations) of Biman. A seven-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident. Biman's director for customer services Aminul Haque heads the committee. Mosharraf Hossain said a BG-118 on London-Sylhet-Dhaka route had run into the accident with 143 passengers on board. The aircraft slipped 65 feet off the central line on landing. bdnew
