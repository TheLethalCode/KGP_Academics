<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  A fine 90 from skipper Salma Khatun failed to stop Bangladesh going down to favourites India by five wickets Tuesday in their fourth match of the Women's Asia Cup at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Sri Lanka. India, the only team yet to lose in the four-nation meet, raced to 161 for five in 41 overs after bundling Bangladesh out for 160 in 50 overs. Bangladesh's batswomen put up an improved display against India compared with their first match against the same opponents. India handed a massive 182-run defeat to Bangladesh after bundling out them for 68. Opting to bat first, Bangladesh were rocked by Indian bowlers who reduced them to 14 for three inside six overs before Panna Ghosh and Salma added 64 for the fourth wicket. Panna fell on 24 and Salma pairing with Irin Khatun (14) put on another 42 runs for the sixth wicket before the Bangladesh captain was the seventh player out, leaving the side at 150 for seven in 47.4 overs. Bangladesh lost their last three wickets for 10 runs and ended up at 160 all out in 50 overs. Salma, who played a winning knock of 53 against Pakistan, made a superb 90 striking 20 fours in 140 balls. India, in reply, initially faced some trouble, but KV Jain (33) and Jhulan Goswami (23) put on 54 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket to steer India home. Panna and Sththira Jakir took one wicket each and three Indian batswomen were run out. Bangladesh face Pakistan for a second time Thursday. b
