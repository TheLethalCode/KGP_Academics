<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh women's cricket team Monday suffered a huge eight-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka women's cricket in their third match of the Women's Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka reached 95 for two in 19.3 overs , chasing Bangladesh's paltry total of 94 all out in 46 overs at Dambulla International Stadium. Pacer Panna Ghosh removed opener Delunu Silva (2) in the third over while Salma Khatun dismissed one-down Shashikala Sirwardene (10) to reduce Sri Lanka to 36 for two in 7.3 overs, but afterwards they failed to maintain the line and length to allow the opponents to go fast to the target. Bangladesh gave away 25 extra runs and Chamari Polgawpola (32) and Suwini de Alwis (26) put on 59 runs for the unbroken third wicket to steer Sri Lanka easily home. After deciding to bat first, Bangladesh faced trouble losing Shukhtara (1) and Panna (4) with Shivomala Weerakkody removing both players. Only Shathira Jakir (25) and two-down Ayesha Akhter (24) crossed the double digits while eight players fell cheaply in the face of some tight bowling from Chamari Polgampola (2/17) and de Alwis (3/13). Bangladesh will face India Tuesday for the second time.
