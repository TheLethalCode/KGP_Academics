<TITLE> Myanmar cyclone death toll 'at 243' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, May 04, (bdnews24.com/BBC) - A tropical cyclone has killed at least 243 people in Myanmar and damaged thousands of buildings, according to state television. Parts of the Irrawaddy region were hit particularly badly, with three out of four buildings reportedly blown down in one district. Myanmar has declared Irrawaddy and four other regions, including the main city Yangon, to be disaster areas. Yangon has been without power and water, its streets full of debris. Winds of about 190km/h (120mph) battered the Irrawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Karen and Mon regions. Military and police personnel have been carrying out rescue operations. Cyclone Nargis has since moved towards Thailand where storm warnings have been issued. However, it appears to be lessening in force. Phone links down. In Irrawaddy's Labutta township, 75% of buildings collapsed and 20% had their roofs ripped off, state TV said. In the Irrawaddy delta region as a whole, the cyclone brought down more than 20,000 houses. In Yangon, internet and phone connections have been down since the storm drew near, making it difficult to confirm the extent of the damage. Official media report that four people were killed and four vessels sank in the former Burmese capital's harbour. A UN regional official told Reuters news agency it would take several days to assess the scale of the damage. "There does not seem to be a high number of casualties but for sure there is a lot of damage to property and infrastructure," Therje Skavdal said, speaking from Bangkok. 'Like Katrina' One unnamed Rangoon resident described the damage in the city for the BBC Myanmar service. "Everything was wrecked," he said. "Roofs of the houses and satellite dishes were blown away. Windows were broken at Yuzana Plaza. Roadside billboards were all blown away... Everything is in a mess." Many roofs were reportedly ripped off even sturdy buildings in Rangoon. "I have never seen anything like it," one retired government worker told Reuters. "It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States." A trishaw driver in Yangon, who did not want to be identified, complained that the security forces were not doing enough to help. "Where are all those uniformed people who are always ready to beat civilians?" he said. "They should come out in full force and help clean up the areas and restore electricity."
