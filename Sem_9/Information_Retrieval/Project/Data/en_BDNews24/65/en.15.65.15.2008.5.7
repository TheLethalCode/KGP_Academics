 ASUNCION, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South American champions Boca Juniors have been banned from staging international matches at their Bombonera stadium after a linesman was hit by an ice cube during a game last week. The South American Football Confederation (CSF) said in a statement that the ban would be lifted once the Argentine club had improved protection in front of the VIP boxes, where the incident occurred. The club were also fined $30,000. Referee Jorge Larrionda ended last Wednesday's Libertadores Cup tie against Brazil's Cruzeiro one minute early after linesman Pablo Fandino of Uruguay suffered a cut on his forehead. Boca, who were winning the third-round, first-leg tie 2-1, have promised to find the culprit and have expressed shock that the ice was thrown from the most expensive seats in the stadium. "The Alberto J. Armando stadium is suspended from all matches organised by the South American Confederation..until work has been completed to provide security for players and referees, especially near the VIP boxes," read the decision published on the CSF's Web site (www.conmebol.com). "The stadium will only be approved once it has been checked by the confederation and only upon the request of the directors for Boca Juniors." The CSF also confirmed that the result would stand. Cruzeiro had claimed that they should be given a 3-0 win because the game did not finish. The second leg is in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday. Three years ago, Boca were given a three-match home ban  widely criticised as too lenientafter a riot forced their Libertadores match at home to Guadalajara to be abandoned in the 79th minute
