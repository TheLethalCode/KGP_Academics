 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation employees fear losing their jobs following an alleged verbal message from the newly elected president. BFF's vice-president Manzoor Hossain Malu on Wednesday asked 22 employees to resign "citing personal reasons", referring to an order from the federation's president Kazi Salahuddin, an employee alleged. BFF chief executive officer retired colonel M Obaidullah Khan said that no-one had asked him to resign, but heard about pressure to quit the federation. Apart from the 22 employees, about 10 employees working under the league committee were also asked to quit, another employee alleged. "It was a misunderstanding," Salahuddin told bdnews24.com Friday. "I have asked those who are not willing to work with the new committee to resign, not all," said the BFF president. "If somebody doesn't want to work with the new committee, he may go," said the former football superstar, who was elected president of BFF on Monday. Malu only said: "I have asked the employees to submit their bio-data with job responsibilities. The president wants to know more about the employees." bd
