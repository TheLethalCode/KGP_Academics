 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium members Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta Saturday demanded the release of all political detainees, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to create an environment for meaningful dialogue and elections. They made the demand at a May Day discussion, organised by the United Federation of Garments Workers at the Awami League's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue. Tofail warned of a humanitarian disaster in the making. "A prelude to humanitarian disaster is looming because of the food crisis. Stalemate prevails in every sector in the country due to the long-running state of emergency," Tofail said. The AL leader said Hasina's release could help overcome the situation. "There is no alternative to creating an environment for meaningful dialogue and acceptable election," Tofail said. He demanded fixing minimum wages for workers at Tk 4,500 each and introduction of a permanent rationing system for them. Suranjit Sengputa said: "We want the Election Commission to abandon a plan to redraw constituencies and pay attention to parliamentary polls instead." "For this, the party president has to be released before the election. Her freedom is urgent for an acceptable election," he said. The organisation's president Roy Romesh Chandra presided. bdnew
