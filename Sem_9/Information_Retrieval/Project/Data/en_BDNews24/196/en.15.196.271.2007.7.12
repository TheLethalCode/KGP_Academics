 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Stocks slumped Thursday as investors initiated sell-offs in the shares of banks and insurance, power, cement and ICT companies to cash in on gains from the previous three-day's rally. Mutual funds however rose on speculation of getting primary shares through the subscription of ongoing IPOs. Some insurance, bank and non-bank financial institutions also moved up significantly. "Profit-taking has sent the market negative. But blue chip stocks are performing well," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages about Tk 700 million in funds. The DGEN or general index slumped 16.17 points or 0.72 percent to 2204.12. The DSI or all-share price index shed 14.16 points or 0.77 percent to close at 1807.31. The DSE-20 blue chip index lost 3.17 points or 0.16 percent to finish at 1879.56. Losers outnumbered gainers 117 to 82. A total of 18 issues held steady on the Dhaka Stock Exchange amid a downturn in turnover at Tk 1.69 billion from Tk 1.95 billion Wednesday as investors started to bag in liquidity to subscribe to the Trust Bank IPO. The opening of subscription to Trust Bank next week also influenced investor sentiment, said Sayeed. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange were also downbeat. On the CSE, turnover rose to Tk 263.21 million from Tk 240.04 million. A total of 30 issues advanced, 75 lost and 12 remained unchanged on the CSE. BRAC Bank, DESCO, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Summit Power and AIMS 1st mutual fund topped the turnover table on the DSE.

Power Grid closed at Tk 591.75, down 2.02 percent over the previous day.
