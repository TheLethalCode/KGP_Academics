<TITLE> Sajeda says Hasina will ignore 'curbs' on her movement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League leader Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury Saturday said her outspoken party chief would come out of her Dhanmondi home everyday despite curbs on her movement by the emergency government. Sheikh Hasina has reportedly been facing restrictions on the movement as the government has allegedly put squeezes on her. The matter became visible Friday when police dawdled to escort her to a city hospital where she later went to see the body of a party colleague. Chowdhury, a presidium member of the party, said from now on Hasina would go to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi everyday to look after its daily activities and accounts. "She'll walk everyday," Chowdhury told reporters after a meeting with Hasina at the museum. Chowdhury, also a former environment and forest minister, asked the government to hold elections soon. "This government has come to save the country. So I ask the government to stage the polls to give the democracy an institutional shape," she said. On the re-commissioning of a frigate, Chowdhury was critical of the government for renaming the ship that was bought during Hasina's term in 1996-2001. The Awami League government named the ship after Bangabandhu but later the BNP-Jamaat government dropped the name after it came to power in 2001. Recently, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed re-commissioned the warship with a new name, Khalid bin Walid. Chowdhury raised a question and said, "Wasn't it meant to distort history?" She also took a dig at the government for its failure to control the prices of essentials. "The government has done some good work. But it has no attention to the soaring prices," she said. Chowdhury accused the government of not taking steps to end the legal course of the Bangabandhu murder case. The former minister also brushed aside the allegations of corruption during her term in office. "An attempt is being made to defame me by extracting statements from some detained persons under pressure. This type of effort is not new. But they won't succeed," she said. bdnews24
