 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Former captain Habibul Bashar and opener Shahriar Nafees have been axed from the ODI squad that would play three one-day internationals against Sri Lanka. The selection committee has decided to bring back Bashar, Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mashud and Mohammad Sharif home after the third and final Test against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said in a press statement Thursday. The final Test is scheduled to end on July 15 in Kandy. Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Farhad Reza and Mahmudullah Riad will join the Tigers in emerald island and are scheduled to leave here on July 14. Mohammad Rafique, who is in the ODI squad, will also return after the third Test due to illness of his son. After the home series against India in May, Bashar stepped aside from the ODI captaincy and announced he would not play ODI at home. "He (Bashar) has little chance to come back in one-dayer if he does not perform extraordinarily in domestic cricket in future," chief selector Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com Thursday. Bashar has been dropped from the ODI squad for the first time since Bangladesh gained Test status in 2000. Opener Nafees, who made 1000 runs in the last calendar year, also followed Bashar as the left-handed opener is having poor run of form since the ICC World Cup in the West Indies. Apart from this duo, Mashud, Rajin and Sharif have often not been considered for the ODI squad. Bangladesh ODI squad: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Javed Omar, Mehrab Hossain, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Tushar Imran, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Abdur Razzak, Saqib Al Hasan, Farhad Reza and Mahmuddullah Riad.
