<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The GSM Association Thursday demanded that the government dismantle BTTB's monopoly over international gateway monopoly to cut the costs of international calls. The association that represents 700 mobile operators also said the existing Tk 800 tax on SIM cards should be reduced to Tk 400 and the tax on capital equipment should not be more than 6 percent, which is now up to 35 percent. Cuts in SIM card and capital equipment taxes will expand the mobile phone sector in Bangladesh, industry experts said. "Dismantling BTTB monopoly over international gateway would lead to a major rise in call volumes and a 125 percent increase in government revenues from international gateway services," Rob Nicholls said in his paper on taxation on mobile phone operators presented at a meeting of GSMA at Radisson Water Garden Hotel in Dhaka. He quoted findings of a research, carried out by global consultancy firms CRA International and Gilbert & Tobin. Nicholls also said the existing tax on SIM cards discourages users to buy mobile phones. "The existing Tk 800 tax on each SIM card should be reduced to Tk 400 for the growth of mobile phone market in Bangladesh," he said. "The mobile phone companies in Bangladesh pay Tk 800 tax on SIM cards in subsidy to woo customers. It's a major barrier," GSM Asia-Pacific chairman Mehboob Chowdhury said. "The burden of taxes on mobile industry should be reduced by removing the taxes on SIM cards, handset and equipment exports. Telecommunication capital equipment should have import duty no higher than 5 to 6 percent," Ricardo Tavares, senior vice-president of GSMA, told a press conference in the middle of the meeting. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman Manzurul Alam delivered the opening address to the meeting. Tenzin Dolma of the World Bank and Abu Saeed Khan, technology editor of bdnews24.com, addressed the meeting as industry experts. bdn
