 BEIJING, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese vessel has sunk 600 km (360 miles) northwest of Guam, leaving 12 crew members missing, Xinhua news agency said on Friday, quoting officials at the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles. Ten people were rescued on Wednesday, the day after the ship sank due to high winds and seas from Typhoon Man-yi, which on Friday struck the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa. Rescue efforts continued for two days, but a dozen crew members remained missing, the officials were quoted as saying.
