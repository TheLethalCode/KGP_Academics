 TORONTO, July 12 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Spain beat Brazil and the United States saw off Uruguay to reach the Under-20 World Cup quarter-finals along with Austria and Czech Republic on Wednesday. Spain came from behind to secure a 4-2 extra-time victory over Brazil in a thrilling encounter in Burnaby.
