 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  The judiciary and the lawyers exhaled a collective sigh of relief at Thursday's resignation of the controversial High Court judge Faisal Mahmud Faizee. The resignation letter of Faizee, facing charges of forging his Bachelor of Law certificate, said he had resigned to uphold the image of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court Bar Association and the lawyers alike have welcomed the resignation. But legal experts told bdnews24.com Friday the image of the judiciary would have been better upheld had Faizee resigned when reports of his forged credentials surfaced in the media three years ago. They also said transparency in appointment of judges based on honesty, qualifications and efficiency is imperative to keep controversial figures like Faizee out of the judiciary, believed to the last bulwark of fairness. Supreme Court Bar Association president barrister Amir Ul Islam praised the role of the chief justice in seeing the back of Faizee. "After cancellation of Justice Faizee's LLB certificate, the chief justice did not allocate him any bench. "The chief justice withdrew him from judicial work and following the decision, Faizee's salary and allowances were stopped," he said. Barrister Amir also thanked the lawyers irrespective of party affiliation and opinion for their resoluteness. "With the resignation of Justice Faizee, the long-held demand of the lawyers have been met," he said. He said those holding positions of constitutional trust, especially judges, are the last recourse to justice for the public. "If any judge loses this trust he should step aside from the post. Had justice Faizee resigned three years ago, the image of the judiciary would have been brighter," he said. Barrister Amir said more transparency was needed in appointing judges so that incidents like the one surrounding Faizee did not recur. "A proper policy should exist for appointment of judges; laws could be formulated in this regard without amending the constitution," he said. Former Appellate Division judge Justice Mohammad Golam Rabbani said the judiciary in Bangladesh is not democratic. He told bdnews24.com: "This colonial-type judicial system does not adapt to the judicial system of an independent sovereign state." He said the debate the High Court judge is not an isolated incident. "Those who appoint judges themselves do not believe in proper justice. So the entire judiciary needs an overhaul." "With the resignation of Justice Faizee the controversy centering him has come to an end. But to avoid such controversy in future the government will have to be sincere in appointing judges," former attorney general and constitutional expert Mahmudul Islam said. Controversy cannot be avoided only by fulfilling the law or the rules in appointing judges, according to Islam. "The most efficient and sincere persons have to be appointed as judges. The chief justice's recommendation must be obeyed in appointing judges," he added. Islam also said in the past, before appointing a person as a judge, a police investigation was carried out and his past history reviewed. "Appointments were made on the basis of qualification, efficiency and honesty," he said. bdnews24.com
