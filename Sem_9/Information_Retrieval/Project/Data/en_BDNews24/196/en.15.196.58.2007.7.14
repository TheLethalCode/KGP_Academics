 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)- Awami League advisory council member Subid Ali Bhuiyan Saturday welcomed the army chief's seven-point recommendation, which he said would eliminate corruption. The retired army officer made his comments to reporters who gathered at his Old DOHS home Saturday. He said, "I agree with army chief Moeen U Ahmed's seven-point recommendation. It will eliminate corruption." Subid Ali stressed the need for reform to different government organs including the Election Commission and the Anticorruption Commission. "If they are reformed there will be no need for party political reforms. Administrative reform is more urgent." Subid Ali said a 'national security council' should mediate in different internal situations. He suggested that the leader of the opposition as well as the chiefs of the army, navy and air force be made members of the council. "People think if there is a national security council all powers will go to the army. This is a misconception. Members of the national security council will only provide advice." Awami League joint general secretary and acting general secretary Mukul Bose had recently said the leaders of the main parties should take responsibility for their failures and step aside. "That is Mukul Bose's personal opinion. I was saddened by the statement. However, I don't think his comment will harm the Awami League," said the former army officer. Subid Ali added, "The decision on whether the two leaders can continue has to be taken by the party council." "A good political party is an asset to the country. If the parties split there will be a political vacuum, which will be filled by extremists." Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta have also made reform proposals. Subid Ali said, "They are tested leaders who have given their own opinions. However, they will not cause the Awami League any problems. They will never leave the Awami League although they should have presented their proposals to the party working committee." Presidium member Suranjit Sengupta's proposals include giving more executive power to the President. Subid Ali said, "In the parliamentary system, executive power should lie with the Prime Minister. If this power is given to the President there will be chaos. This proposal is redundant, although a balance in state power is necessary." Regarding Bangladesh's security he said, "By the grace of Allah we have a neighbour like India. They aided our independence." On Sheikh Hasina's restricted movements he said, "I cannot understand the government's motives." bdnews24.
