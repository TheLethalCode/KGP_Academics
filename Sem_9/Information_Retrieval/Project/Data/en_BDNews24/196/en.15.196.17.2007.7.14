<TITLE> Pakistan to conduct dope tests on Twenty20 players </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Cricket Board (PCB) will conduct out-of-competition dope tests on the 30 players they have named in their preliminary squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. A senior board official said on Saturday the dope tests would be conducted soon as part of Pakistan's zero tolerance policy against drugs in sports. Pakistan faced a embarrassing drugs scandal last year when their fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif failed out-of-competition tests before the Champions Trophy in India in October. The two, who tested positive for nandrolone, were initially banned but were later exonerated of all charges and had their bans lifted by an appeals panel. "We have decided to have dope tests on all 30 of our players in the preliminary squad because we just want to avoid any more incidents and also because we remain committed to the International Cricket Council (ICC) strict anti-doping policy in the sport," Zakir Khan, director of cricket operations told Reuters. Both Shoaib and Asif have been included in the Twenty20 preliminary squad
