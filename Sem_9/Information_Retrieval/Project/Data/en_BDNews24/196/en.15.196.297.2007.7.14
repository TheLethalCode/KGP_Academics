 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga on Friday declared Argentina as favourites to win the Copa America final against his team on Sunday. "From what Argentina have done so far, they are the favourites," he told reporters. "We've done our part by reaching the final, now we have to surpass that. "But I always want to win, this is a final and anything can happen," he added. "We have conviction in our work, we knew it would not be easy, that there would be innumerable difficulties on the way." Argentina have scored 16 goals and won all five games in reaching the final. Brazil, on the other hand, lost to Mexico in the early rounds and needed penalties to beat Uruguay in their semi-final. Brazil are also without Ronaldinho and Kaka, who asked to be rested from the tournament, while Argentina are at full strength. "Argentina is a mature team which has played together before, Brazil is a new team with only two players from the last World Cup," added Dunga. The old rivals also met in the 2004 Copa America final in Peru, where Brazil scored with the last kick of the game to force a 2-2 draw and then won on penalties
