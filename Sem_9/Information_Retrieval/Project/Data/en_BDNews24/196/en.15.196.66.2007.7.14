<TITLE> CU moves to take Faizee fiasco to ACC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University will file a complaint with the Anti-corruption Commission against Faisal Mahmud Faizee, the controversial High Court judge who resigned facing charges of forging his law degree certificate, the vice-chancellor said Friday. Professor M Badiul Alam told bdnews24.com that the CU syndicate decided the move at a meeting. The VC and a syndicate member alleged that Faizee attempted to smear the university by blaming an unnamed section for spreading political propaganda against him. The university authorities will not stop at his resignation and go ahead with the move they deem fit. Prof Alam said: "The university syndicate stripped him and others of forged certificates in line with university rules. There was no political motive behind the decision. "Now a complaint will be filed with the Anticorruption Commission against Justice Faizee in line with the syndicate decision," the VC said. On March 3, the syndicate stripped Faizee of his LLB certificate, which the university said was forged and decided to file a complaint with the ACC. But the university did not press the complaint at the time as Faizee had filed a writ appeal against the scrapping of his certificate. On March 10, the university authorities published a gazette on the cancellation of certificates of 50 former students including Justice Faizee. Helal Uddin Nizami, a member of the syndicate, told bdnews24.com: "There was no political motive or influence whatsoever behind the decision. By terming it a political propaganda he (Faizee) tried to throw the university into controversy and damage its image." bdnews24.co
