 LOS ANGELES, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham wore a light grey suit and his wife Victoria looked posh in a purple dress on Friday as a throng of fans in soccer shirts reflected the storied life of one of the world's best-known players. Girls screamed and fans wore their hearts on their shirts -- the red of Manchester United, white of Real Madrid, white of England and the gold, white and blue of Beckham's new team, the Los Angeles Galaxy -- to greet the British star on his official arrival to U.S. professional soccer. Chanting "We love Beckham" and "There's only one David Beckham," about 2,500 mainly young Americans and British expatriates came to the Galaxy stadium, south of Los Angeles, for a glimpse of their hero. "We are Beckham fans. We will come and see more games now," said Bo Riley, 14, sporting a Manchester United shirt. "We would never have watched the MLS (Major League Soccer) if not for Beckham." Chris Russell, 33, took the day off work to see Friday's presentation on the stadium field. "He is one of the best players in the world. I think he will be a leader and can teach us a lot," Russell said. Victoria Beckham, known as "Posh" from her past in the Spice Girls pop group, posed separately before some 700 photographers, reporters and cameramen who had traveled from as far afield as Australia and Britain for the presentation. In a 20-minute ceremony, capped by a burst of blue, white and gold confetti, David Beckham, 32, looked shy as he thanked the fans for their support. He said he was looking forward to the challenge of playing soccer in the United States, where the sport is hugely popular among young players but falls far behind baseball, football and basketball as a spectator event. But Beckham told fans the most important thing in his life was his family, with soccer a strong second. "In our life, everything is perfect," he said of his wife and their three young sons. SOCCER OR FOOTBALL? In informal media interviews, a relaxed Beckham scotched speculation that he was planning a Hollywood career alongside his five-year, $250 million contract with Galaxy. "People have talked about me going into movies and Hollywood but I am only here to play football," he said, admitting he was struggling to get used to calling the game "soccer." For Americans, football means a contact sport played with helmets and pads. "I do get the terms mixed up," Beckham said, laughing. "At some point I'll get it." Beckham said he hoped his new team would soon be able to put the commotion surrounding his arrival behind them. "Once I am in with the lads and training, hopefully they will see I am just part of the team and only in it for the football," Beckham said. Make that the soccer
