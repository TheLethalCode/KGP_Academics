 KANDY, Sri Lanka, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene paid tribute to his team after a crushing 3-0 series victory against Bangladesh on Saturday but saw no room for complacency ahead of the tour of Australia later this year. Sri Lanka bowled Bangladesh out for 176 in 59 overs to defeat the visitors by an innings and 193 runs, their third consecutive innings victory. "The whole team played really well in all departments and when you perform to that level it is always going to be tough for a team like Bangladesh to keep up," Jayawardene told reporters. "I was a bit surprised we finished it today after two days of rain but the way we bowled in their first innings and then scoring 470 in one day put them under a lot of pressure. "Credit should go to the whole team for the way they executed our gameplan," he added. "We will now keep focusing on what is ahead of us and will not rest on our laurels, especially in Australia this November," he said. "That tour is something we are all looking forward to as it will be a great challenge." Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful admitted: "Playing test cricket is very tough in Sri Lanka." "Murali bowled well today on a wicket that was difficult to bat on and there were some rash strokes," he added. "I am confident that we will put up a better performance in the one-day series." Coach Shaun Williams called on Bangladesh to learn from Sri Lanka. "Sri Lanka gave us a lesson on how to go about playing good hard solid test cricket - they allowed us nothing and that's what you expect from a quality team," he said
