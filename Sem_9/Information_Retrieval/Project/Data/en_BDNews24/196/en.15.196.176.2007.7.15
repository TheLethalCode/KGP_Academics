 Toufique Imrose Khalidi bdnews24.com Editor-in-Chief Singapore, July 15 (bdnews24.com) -- President Iajuddin Ahmed arrived in Singapore early Sunday morning for a routine medical check-up on a visit he agreed to call "partly official". "I am doing fine  going for just a routine check-up," the President, whose heart surgery last year kicked off a huge political controversy over the way he was treated by the then ruling BNP, told bdnews24.com on board the flight minutes after the plane carrying him left Dhaka. During the visit, he would also "see" Singapore President SR Nathan. In response to a suggestion"so it's partly official", he said: "Yes." Asked if he was carrying any official message or there was anything special about this trip, the President said: "Nothing of that sort really." The 76-year-old former professor of soil science at Dhaka University indeed looked hale and hearty. Travelling on a regular commercial Singapore Airlines flight, he was accompanied by wife Anwara Begum, also a Dhaka University professor. A beaming, smiling president was not ready for an in-flight interview, but promised a regular one laterto talk about his five years in office. Everything unfolded amid tight security. The meeting was prearranged, and a security officer, who escorted this correspondent to the front row of the flight's Business Class, said beforehand it would be just saying salam since "you two are known to each other". Requests for recording the conversation was instantly turned down by the officer. "Can I take notes using pen and paper?" A polite "No, Sir" was the answer from the young officer. The President's military secretary Major General Aminul Karim, seated just behind him, suggested a formal interview sometime later. bdn
