 MOSCOW, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has suspended its participation in a key pact limiting conventional forces in Europe through a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday. The decree suspended Russia's role in the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) pact, adopted in 1990 to limit the number of tanks, heavy artillery and combat aircraft deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia's Ural mountains. Russia has accused the West of failing to ratify an amended version signed in 1999 to take into account the new post-Cold War situation. Talks last month with NATO states ended without progress. A NATO spokesman said on Saturday of the Russian suspension: "If this is confirmed the Secretary General very much regrets this decision. The allies consider this treaty to be an important cornerstone of European security." A major source of friction is NATO's insistence on preserving "flanking arrangements" which ban large concentrations of forces and materiel near some borders. Russia objects to that provision because it limits Russian troop movements within Russian territory although Moscow says its border areas have become more unstable since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Moscow's suspension of participation in the CFE comes amid a wider deterioration of relations with Western countries, involving Russian resentment at the spread of NATO eastwards, Western worries over dependence on Russian energy and spying allegations.
