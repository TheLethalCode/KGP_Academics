 ISLAMABAD, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 12 Pakistani security personnel were killed on Sunday in a series of bomb blasts and an exchange of fire with Islamist militants, the second major attack in the northwest in 24 hours, officials said. The blasts hit as a convoy of police and paramilitary troops passed through the town of Matta near the hilly Swat area, well known as a stronghold of pro-Taliban militants. "The death toll could go higher," an intelligence official told Reuters. "It appeared to be an ambush. There were three blasts of improvised explosive devices, followed by an exchange of fire," he added. The latest attack came a day after a suicide bomber killed 18 Pakistani paramilitary soldiers and wounded 24 in the volatile North Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border. Military spokesmen said that attack in North Waziristan might have been linked to last week's commando storming of a radical mosque in the capital, Islamabad. The army said 75 people had been killed in the assault on the Lal Masjid mosque-religious school complex. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao said on Friday 60-65 of the dead were militants and four or five of them were foreigners, but did not say from where. Pakistan's rugged northwest is a hotbed of al Qaeda and Taliban support, from where Taliban launch raids into Afghanistan, US military officers in Afghanistan say. Nearly 50 people have been killed in bomb attacks targeting troops and police in the northwest since July 3, when security forces surrounded the mosque complex following clashes with gunmen based there. MILITANT BACKLASH Security analysts have expressed fears of a militant backlash mainly in the conservative North West Frontier Province (NWFP) where pro-Taliban fighters were very active after the storming of the mosque. Many of the militants who turned the Lal Masjid complex into a virtual fortress, and many of the religious students who studied there, were believed to have been from the NWFP. This week's attacks on the security forces were the most serious since November when a suicide bomber killed 42 army recruits on a training ground in the northwestern town of Dargai. Last Sunday, three Chinese workers were shot dead in Peshawar in an attack police said appeared to be linked to the Lal Masjid. Protesters angry about the mosque assault have ransacked offices and looted supplies of Western aid agencies in various parts of the province. The government has sent extra troops to at least four different parts of the province. US security officials say al Qaeda members plot violence in Afghanistan from sanctuaries in North Waziristan and other lawless tribal regions on the Pakistani side of the border. The Pakistani government struck a deal with tribal elders in North Waziristan last September aimed at isolating foreign militants. Attacks on Pakistani security forces in the region have been relatively rare since then.
