<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com) - Muktijoddha Sangsad KS got derailed from the B. League race when the title aspirants conceded a 2-1 defeat to Arambagh KS in the second-leg encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. With three defeats in 18 outings, Muktijoddha have 33 points to stick to the second position with only two matches in hands, but Dhaka Abahani and Dhaka Mohammedan have 35 and 32 points with four matches in their hands. Arambagh KS, on the other hand, joined the fifth-placed Brothers Union with 23 points from 17 matches. The freedom fighters' team went ahead in the 36th minute with the strike of Alfaz, who firmed home dodging past defender Akram after capitalising a right-side cross from Brahim. But, the All-Red outfit lost their lead just before breather when Nigerian Iddi levelled the margin for Arambagh, who lost to Muktijoddha 1-0 in the first leg match. Iddi headed home meeting a Dominic cross from the right side in the 45th minute. With a first half 1-1 level, Juku struck in the 66th minute to give Arambagh seventh triumph as he saw his 30-yard shot kiss the back of the Muktijoddha net. Muktijoddha could have left the field with a one-point had a powerful shot from Khanchan not rattled the Arambagh bar in the 71st minute.
