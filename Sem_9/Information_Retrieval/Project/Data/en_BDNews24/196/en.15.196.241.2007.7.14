<TITLE> Fujimori's daughter, Peru's next president? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The daughter of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori declined on Friday to say if she would mount a presidential bid, saying it was too early to make such a decision. Asked by Reuters if she wanted to follow in the footsteps of her father, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, Keiko Fujimori, a member of the Peruvian Congress, smiled and said: "This is not the right moment." "It's still too early to think about that because I have a lot of things to do," she said, speaking in the luxury condominium in Santiago, Chile, where her father is under house arrest. "It's not in my thoughts at the moment." Speculation about a possible Keiko presidential bid has increased since she was elected to Congress last year with the highest number of votes of any candidate. The next presidential elections are due in 2011. If she were to stand, it would mark another twist in the extraordinary story of the Fujimori political dynasty. Keiko's mother, Susana Higuchi, was a member of Congress, while her father plans to stand in Japan's upper house elections this month. The son of Japanese immigrants to Peru, Alberto Fujimori has duel Peruvian-Japanese citizenship and spent five years in Japan after his Peruvian government collapsed in 2000 under the weight of a huge corruption scandal. Keiko was Peru's first lady at the age of 20. Her father bestowed the title upon her in 1995 after divorcing Higuchi. EXTRADITION BATTLE The US-educated Keiko, 32, said one of her main focuses was helping her father in his extradition battle with Peruvian authorities, who charge him with corruption and human rights abuses during his rule. Fujimori has been under arrest in Chile since he arrived in Santiago unexpectedly in late 2005. He won a major legal victory this week in his bid to avoid extradition when a Chilean Supreme Court judge threw out Peru's case against him. The case now goes to the court for final consideration. "I've always had faith in the Chilean judicial system and I've always maintained my father would come up smelling of roses from this extradition process," Keiko said. The eldest of four children from Fujimori's first marriage, Keiko also said she feared her father, 68, would not receive a fair trial if he were extradited to Peru. The congresswoman, who is four months pregnant, said she was sure her father would one day return to Peru, as he has often promised. "When the extradition process ends, and obviously if he gets the vote of confidence of the Japanese people (in the July 29 Senate elections), he will go to Japan to fulfill his responsibilities," she said. "But he has promised to return to Peru and I'm sure he'll be true to his word." Fujimori is still tremendously popular in some quarters in Peru, where he won praise for his tough stance on terrorism, particularly during a four-month siege of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima in 1996-1997. But his critics say he abused his power and committed serious human rights abuses during his tenure.
