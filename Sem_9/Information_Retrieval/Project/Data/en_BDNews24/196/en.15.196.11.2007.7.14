<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday said 'reform-minded' leaders would call a requisition meeting if chairperson Khaleda Zia did not approve the reform proposal. "If we don't get permission of the chairperson, we'll go for a requisition meeting. If the state of emergency continues for long we will seek permission from the government to hold a council session," he said at a press briefing at his Gulshan home. The 'need' for a requisition meeting shows a growing rift between so-called reformists of the BNP and its chairperson. Bhuiyan differed with joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy's statement to reporters after a meeting with him Friday. "Gayeshwar Chandra Roy misquoted me. I didn't have any talks over who will lead the party council. He just came to express support for the reform proposal," Bhuiyan said. After the meeting with the secretary general, Roy told reporters Friday, "I have had talks with the secretary general. He has assured me that the council will be held under the leadership of chairperson Khaleda Zia." Roy's statement prompted sharp reactions from 'reformists'. Former BNP lawmaker Zahiruddin Swapan protested Roy's statement in the media. Bhuiyan called the press briefing Saturday to clarify the matter. He said the council would be held in line with the party constitution. The constitution explains clearly who will lead the way in holding the council. "A normal process is to seek permission from the chairperson for the council. If she agrees, that's good. If she doesn't, we have to go for a requisition meeting," he said. Asked when he would seek permission, Bhuiyan said: "We are are preparing for the council. We are contacting councillors. We will then go to the chairperson." A preparatory committee will be formed to hold the council and to decide who will preside over the council session, he said. Asked whether he was running into a conflict with Khaleda over reforms, Bhuiyan said there are opinions for and against the proposal. "The chairperson has sometimes spoken against our reform proposal which created suspicion." He said a copy of the reform proposal has already been sent to the chairperson. Bhuiyan said the chairperson would be briefed on everything in time. "She is with us. She will get involved when necessary." Bhuiyan announced a 15-point reform proposal on June 25 and a revised 14-point proposal on July 12. bdnew
