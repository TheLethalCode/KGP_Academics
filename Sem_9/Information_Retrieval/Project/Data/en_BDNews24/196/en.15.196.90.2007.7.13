 LONDON, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will play Scotland in a one day international for the first time next year, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Friday. The match has provisionally been scheduled for Aug. 18 and a further match has been arranged for 2012 depending on Scotland's continued status as a one-day international nation. "Having the full England side in Scotland for an ODI next year will give the game a huge boost and I am sure our cricketing public will be looking forward to welcoming the England team," said Roddy Smith, chief executive of Cricket Scotland. Scotland were given one-day international status at the start of 2006. Both countries are also competing in this year's inaugural Twenty20 World Cup to be played in South Africa in September
