 ISLAMABAD, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 14 Pakistanis, including 11 soldiers, were killed in an ambush on a convoy on Sunday, taking the death toll to 38 in attacks in the northwest of the country in the past 24 hours, officials said. The attacks appear to be revenge for a commando assault on a radical mosque in the capital last week in which 75 supporters of hardline clerics and nine soldiers were killed, security officials said. Militants ambushed a convoy of police and paramilitary troops passing through Matta town of North West Frontier Province, where pro-Taliban militants are known to operate. Two roadside bombs and two suicide bombers struck the convoy in the attack in the Swat district, said military spokesman Major-General Arshad Waheed. Three civilians were also killed. "Blood is splattered all over the road. A paramilitary vehicle is totally gutted," Pakistani reporter Moosa Khan said by telephone from the scene. The attack came a day after a suicide bomber killed 24 Pakistani paramilitary soldiers and wounded nearly 30 in the volatile North Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border. Military officials say while there has been no claim of responsibility, the attacks appear to be linked to last week's commando storming of the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, in Islamabad. The government said 75 people, at least 60 of them militants, were killed in the assault on the mosque-religious school complex, where militants accumulated an arsenal of weapons and where a hardline cleric defied government orders to surrender. Security analysts have expressed fears of a militant backlash. At least one wanted militant, speaking before commandos seized the Lal Masjid, had threatened to launch revenge attacks if the mosque was assaulted. Pakistan's rugged northwest is a hotbed of al Qaeda and Taliban support, from where Taliban launch raids into Afghanistan, US military officers in Afghanistan say. About 90 people have been killed in attacks on troops and police in northwestern Pakistan since July 3, when security forces surrounded the Lal Masjid after clashes with gunmen. Many of the militants who turned the complex into a virtual fortress, and many of the religious students who studied there, were believed to have been from the NWFP. The government said four or five foreign militants were among the dead in the Lal Masjid assault, but did not say from where. Protesters angry about the mosque assault have ransacked offices and looted supplies of Western aid agencies in various parts of the province. bdnews24.com/lq/1420hrs The government has sent extra troops to at least four parts of th
