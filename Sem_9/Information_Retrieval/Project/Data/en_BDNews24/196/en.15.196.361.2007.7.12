 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  A man Wednesday paid Tk 4.66 crore in taxes to legalise untaxed money, the chief of the National Board of Revenue said Thursday. This is the biggest amount to have come from an individual so far, according to the NBR. An official asked NBR chairman Badiur Rahman if they should go after the man for not paying the taxes early. "Not at all, we would rather invite him to tea," he said. "People with undisclosed money are coming up to legalise it as the deadline is coming closer," Rahman told senior income tax officials. As of Wednesday, Rahman told bdnews24.com, they had received Tk 16.75 crore in such taxes. The government on June 5 offered people the facility to legalise undisclosed money until July 31 by paying only 5 percent tax in penalty in addition to normal tax. "We're getting huge response in recent days and hope collections from this provision will rise gradually," Rahman told bdnews24.com. The chairman talked to senior NBR officials about ways to achieve the target set out in the current budget. He asked them to try to talk people into paying taxes instead of harassing them. The government has targeted Tk 10,838 crore in income tax earnings in the budget for FY 2007-08. Earnings from income tax were about Tk 9,000 crore, up by Tk 500 crore from the original target of Tk 8,500 crore. bd
