<TITLE> Basile unhappy over kickoff time for final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Alfio Basile has criticised organisers of the Copa America over the kickoff time for Sunday's final against Brazil. The match will start at 1705 local time (2105 GMT) when the tropical sun is still burning and is due to finish in daylight. Temperatures in the steamy oil city are regularly over 32 Celsius in the late afternoon. "I think it will be a slow game because of the time," he said. "In our country, it was below zero when we left to come here. It's not going to be an end-to-end match." "The heat is incredible, it's 40 Celsius," added the gravel-voiced coach, who himself has defied the heat by wearing his so-called lucky jacket on the touchline at every game. "In the evening, it's beautiful for playing football and it's better for the public because the game is played at a faster pace." "I suppose this has to do with money," he added. "But the players would suffer less in the evening, they would develop their game better. It would be better for Brazil and Argentina." With Argentina favourites to win their first title for 14 years, Basile appealed for the importance of the match to be kept in perspective. "There's no need to dramatise," he said. "I know about the importance of the game, the public, about taking the cup back home to our people. But it's not a matter of life or death. It's a football match." Basile, whose team have scored 16 goals and won all five games on the way to the final, said Argentina would stay faithful to their passing game against the physical Brazilians. "The only way to play football is by having the ball in your possession and knowing how to use it," he said. "And we mustn't go onto the pitch worrying about how long it is since we have won anything." Basile also remembered his previous stint in charge, when he won the Copa America in 1991 and 1993 but then saw his team knocked out by Romania in the second round at the 1994 World Cup. "On that occasion, I had to leave the country in a helicopter," he joked. "We had a great team, it was good enough to have won the Cup but it didn't happen and that was a frustration. "The years went by, I always dreamt I could coach the team again and here I am.
