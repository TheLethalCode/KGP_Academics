According to KCNA, the proposal would call for talks between North Korean and US military officials to be attended by a United Nations representative, at a mutually acceptable place and time. The topic would be issues relating to peace and security on the Korean peninsula. Six-party talks on the North's nuclear programme are due to start on July 18.
