<TEXT>
 Kandy, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mahela Jayawardene and his deputy Kumar Sangakkara cracked sparkling centuries to help Sri Lanka lead by 369 runs at close of the third day of the final Test against Bangladesh at Asgiriya Stadium Friday. Sri Lanka were 500 for four when the bails were drawn for almost a rain-free third day after rains and bad light allowed only 55 of the stipulated 180 overs of play in the first two days. Sangakkara, playing in his old school ground, remained unbeaten on 222, his sixth double Test hundred in 109 innings and Tillakaratne Dilshan was with him on 17. Sangakkara pulled Ashraful for four to hit back-to-back double Test hundred in the ongoing rubber following his unbeaten 200 in the second Test in Colombo. The left-handed top-order batsman, who cover-drove Ashraful for four to reach his 14th Test hundred, blasted 28 fours in 277 deliveries to become seventh batsman in Tests to have cracked two double hundreds in a series. Jayawardene, who survived a confident leg before appeal on naught by Syed Rasel, blazed to 165, the seventh time that he had gone beyond 150 mark in 143 innings. The Sri Lankan skipper, who dabbed Mohammad Ashraful to the short third man to reach his 18th Test hundred, smashed three sixes and 15 boundaries in 210 deliveries to hammer his second ton of the series. The Jayawardene-Sangakkara pair also eclipsed the best-ever partnership of 280 between two Test nations, made by Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thilan Samaraweera for the fifth wicket, to put on 311 for the third wicket before Syed Rasel had Jayawardene caught by Mohammad Ashraful. Rasel, playing his first match in the series, constantly troubled the batsmen, but he got little support from the other end as Bangladesh struggled to slow the flow of runs despite setting defensive fields. Rasel removed both overnight openers quickly in the morning before striking again in the final session. He broke the third wicket stand between Sangakkara and Jayawardene, who paced his innings as if he was playing in a one-day. Rasel returned with three for 104 in 31 overs while Mashrafee Bin Morataza, coming in as a first-change bowler Friday, was surprisingly the most expensive bowler, conceding 125 runs in 24 overs without any wicket. Rasel drew the first blood in the day's fifth over trapping overnight opener Upal Tharanga (12) leg before, who offered no shot and then snapped up the other overnight opener Michael Vandort for 43, just clipping his leg bail to leave Sri Lanka to 74-2. Sri Lanka having resumed the day on 30 for no loss added 470 runs in 98.2 overs losing four wickets. Bangladesh, dismissed for 131 in the first innings, trailing in the series by 2-0 following two innings defeats in Colombo and are certainly in for a whitewash. bd
