 Pijush Acharya, Kamran Reza Chowdhury and Jahangir Kabir Jewel Brahmanbaria/Mymensingh, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  The suicide of nine members of a family in Mymensingh has been wrapped in further mystery with the emergence of a woman who claims to be a member of the family. Merazunnahar Mobi, who identified herself as a daughter of Anwar Darbesh, said it was a preplanned killing, not suicide. Her eight-year-old son Mawla and five-year-old daughter Tabassum Moon were also among the nine dead, Mobi said. Mobi talked to reporters in her rented home in Medda area of Brahmanbaria district headquarters in the afternoon. She demanded punishment to the killers. Unruly, fanatic neighbours might have compelled them to choose the path of suicide, she added. Nine members of the family were crushed to death after they stood in the path of a moving train in Kashore area of Mymensingh district Wednesday. Mobi did not go to Mymensingh to claim her children buried unclaimed. Brahmanbaria police picked up Mobi and quizzed her at the police station. Mobi said that her brother Golam Mahin, who studied at Oxford University, was killed on September 10, 2005 by unidentified men. She suspected the killers of her brother might have also killed the nine. Mobi trashed news reports that the deceased converted to Christianity. The reports were totally false and baseless, she said. Witnesses, the train driver and police said the nine people willingly stood in the path of the moving train. Again, one of the deceased Leena, who used to live in Anwar's house as a disciple, in her diary wrote that some people in her village were trying to occupy the house of Anwar Darbesh, known as Anwar Aadom as he envisaged 'Aadom religion'. "I saw some people walking along the rail line. Suddenly they stepped on the track and were crushed," Shah Muhammad Enayet Hossain Khan, the train driver, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "I saw that they (the deceased) were sitting beside the rail line. The train was whistling, but they did not move," construction worker Sanchaya Kumar Sarkar, who witnessed the incident, told bdnews24.com Friday. Mobi's cousin Toriqul Alam Tuhin told bdnews24.com Saturday that his aunt Hena Anwar's family members did not mix with anyone even their blood relations since the death of Anwar Darbesh in July 11, 2000. "It is not right that people were trying to occupy their land," Tuhin told bdnews24.com. Tuhin said the deceased had no enmity with anyone in the neighbourhood. Mymensingh district police chief Rafiqul Islam said: "There is no doubt that they committed suicide." "Mobi might have had disagreement with other members of the family over joint suicide decision. Therefore, she might have fled the house," Abdus Salam, the investigation officer of the unnatural death case, told bdnews24.com Saturday. Anwar's third daughter Murshida in her dairy wrote that they were four sisters and two brothers. "Murshida might have intentionally wrongly written that they were four daughters and two brothers as she might have had disagreement with other family members," Salam said. Meanwhile, the only disciple Leena wrote in her diary that she had had a new life by adopting the Aadom religion envisaged by Anwar Darbesh. She also wrote some derogatory comments on the Prophet Muhammad (SM). "Some people in the village want to occupy the house of Aadom (Anwar Darbesh). They have eyed Aadom's house. But they do not know that a direct action will start if they come here let alone occupy the house", said Leena, who called Anwar Darbesh grandfather. Anwar's son Arif in his diary said, "There is no existence of religion and religion is man-made." But he accepted his father's 'Aadom religion'. In the message of the new Aadom religion, Anwar Aadom also wrote derogatory comments about the Prophet. Rafiqul Islam quoted Leena's brother, a diploma engineer, as saying that his mother and two sisters lived in the house of Anwar Darbesh as followers for seven to eight months before 2000. Leena's mother and a sister left the house in 2000, but Leena accepted Anwar's 'religion' and refused to leave Anwar's house cutting ties with her family members. bdnews24.co
