 Jhenidah, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  A fish trader Friday night sued former BNP lawmaker from Jhenidah-3 Shahidul Islam and nine others on charges of extorting Tk 5 lakh. Former general secretary of Salemanpur Fishermen Cooperative Association Kartik Halder filed the case with Moheshpur Police Station. He alleged in the case that on May 20, 2002 Shahidul and his cronies had gone to Salemanpur Baor and demanded Tk 5 lakh in toll from the fishermen. The fishermen refused to pay him toll and Shahidul abusing his power formed a fake fishermen's association, took control of the Boar and drove away the genuine fishermen. The former MP also embezzled Tk 5.25 lakh from the association's funds and looted goods including bamboos worth about Tk 2 lakh. The other accused are Shahidul Haque, Rafiqul, Ali Akbar, Forkan Ali, Prodyut Halder, Moshiur, Zafar, Abdus Sattar and Nazrul. All the accused are on the run. Moheshpur police chief Abdus Shahid said he was investigating the charges. Two more cases, one for alleged embezzlement of relief tin sheets and another for extortion, were filed against Shahidul after the declaration of state of emergency. bdnews2
