<TEXT>
 Kandy, July 14 (bdnews24.com) - Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has claimed his 700th Test scalp, as Sri Lanka whitewashed Bangladesh in their three-match Test series. Sri Lanka overcame Bangladesh 3-0, inflicting an innings and 193 run defeat on the fourth day of the final Test at Asgiriya Stadium Saturday. Bangladesh collapsed to 176 all out in the second innings, from 106 for two at lunch as Muralitharan grabbed six wickets for 54 runs. This was his 60th five-wicket haul in 113 tests. The off-spin wizard had Syed Rasel (4) caught by Farveez Maharoof at mid-off to wrap up Bangladesh's second innings. Muralitharan has now become only the second Test bowler to reach the 700-club wicket. Only retired Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne has claimed more with 708 wickets in 145 Tests. Muralitharan, who was named man of the match as well as the series, raised his wicket tally against Bangladesh to 76 in nine Tests. He started the series with 50 wickets in six Tests. Bangladesh, however, reached their 29th innings defeat in 49 Tests. This was their seventh against Sri Lanka in 10 Tests. Bangladesh has now lost five matches in three days against the Lankans as many Tests in four days. This is the 20th time Bangladesh has lost a Test inside four days after 15 defeats in three days. Bangladesh has been able to take only eight Tests to their fifth day. After trailing by 369 runs, Bangladesh had a brilliant start to their fourth day with openers Shahriar Nafees and Javed Omar adding 47 runs before Lasith Malinga had Javed (22) caught by Kumar Sangakkara at first slip for 22. Nafees and Habibul Bashar then took the score to 98 before Muralitharan took one step closer to the history books by bowling Habibul Bashar (15) out just before lunch, on his way to his 700th wicket. Nafees was the highest scorer with 64 until he fell to Muralitharan. Muralitharan also dismissed Mohammad Ashraful (19), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (8), Shahadat Hossain (5) and Rasel (4). Nafees hit nine fours in 115 balls to reach his third Test fifty. This was his tenth Test innings since his 79 against Australia in the second Test in Chittagong 2006. Pace duo Sujeewa de Silva and Lasith Maling chipped in with two wickets each for 34 and 46. Sri Lanka declared their first innings with an overnight total of 500 for 4, Bangladesh were subsequently bundled out for 131 in the first innings. B
