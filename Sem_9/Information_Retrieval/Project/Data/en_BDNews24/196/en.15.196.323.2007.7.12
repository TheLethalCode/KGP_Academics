 TEHRAN, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian nuclear officials and a visiting team from the U.N. nuclear watchdog held a second round of talks on Thursday to discuss ways to remove outstanding questions about Iran's disputed nuclear programme. Iran has offered to draw up an "action plan" to address Western suspicions that its nuclear programme is a front to obtain nuclear arms. Tehran says it needs nuclear technology only to generate power.

Diplomats say the United States and its European Union allies believe Iran's offer of transparency may be little more than a bid to buy time and avert further U.N. measures. Two rounds of sanctions have been imposed on Iran since December for failing to halt enrichment, and a third one is being considered. The IAEA wants explanations for traces of highly enriched -- bomb-grade -- uranium found on some equipment, and also wants more information about experiments with plutonium and the status of research into an advanced centrifuge able to enrich uranium three times as fast as the model Iran now uses. The IAEA also wants to know more about documents showing how to cast uranium metal for a bomb co
