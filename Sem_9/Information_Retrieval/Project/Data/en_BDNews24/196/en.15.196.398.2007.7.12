 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)A Singapore-based company fined in the recent past for failure to supply urea fertiliser is trying to persuade the government to grant it another similar contract, BCIC officials said. On April 14, M/S Reliant Commodities and Technologies Private Limited in a letter to the industry adviser has solicited a contract of supplying fertiliser at a rate lower than the bidding price per tonne ($384), an industry ministry document obtained by bdnews24.com reveals. Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation has rejected the offer saying all agreements with the Singaporean company have been cancelled. Officials said there was no scope to reconsider their proposal. The industry ministry, however, has forwarded the application to the central procurement technical unit (CPTU) of the planning ministry last week for its comments and suggestions. Earlier, the company contracted to supply 1.3 lakh tonnes urea fertiliser failed to execute the order despite extension of the deadline to Jan 31, 2007. "Once the agreement has been cancelled, Reliant can't be reappointed as contractor as per contractual obligations," a senior CPTU official told bdnews24.com Monday, requesting anonymity. "If Reliant is allowed to come in again, the BCIC may lose the case filed by Reliant reclaiming its security money confiscated by the BCIC." The BCIC confiscated about Tk 28 croreTk 1.5 crore (bid-bond money) for failure to provide performance guaranty and Tk 26.47 crore for failure to supply 1.3 lakh tonnes of urea by Reliant. But two separate court stay orders have stopped the BCIC from realising the full amount. BCIC chairman Moklesur Rahman told bdnews24.com by telephone Thursday that they were yet to get CPTU response. Earlier in 2006, Summit Industrial and Mercantile Corporation, the local representative of Reliant, had become the lowest bidder in three separate international tenders for total supply of 2.87 lakh tonnes of urea fertiliser. The supplier's failure to supply 1.3 lakh tonnes of urea put the government in great difficulty meeting domestic demand. Bangladesh's urea demand for FY 2006-07 was 28.75 lakh tonnes, of which, 18 lakh tonnes were produced domestically at the six BCIC factories and the rest was meant to be imported. Fertiliser scarcity in the recent times has been a common phenomenon in the country. Only last week, thousands of fertiliser-starved farmers at Nachole in Chapainawabganj ransacked and set ablaze the office of upazila nirbahi officer demanding fertiliser. bdnew
