<TITLE> Raising energy prices now suicidal: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  A nongovernmental think-tank, Centre for Policy Dialogue, Saturday said that the government move towards raising prices of gas, power and fertiliser in line with an IMF suggestion would be suicidal. "It would be an erratic decision to hike energy prices at the time when inflationary pressure is increasingly hurting people," Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, executive director of CPD, told a press briefing in its office. CPD research director Prof Mostafizur Rahman was present. Bhattacharya said: "The government is increasingly coming closer to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in terms of taking economic policy decisions." He claimed that the government planned to raise prices to get $200 million in loans from the WB, which considers the IMF outlook before issuing the loans. The briefing was arranged to give the CPD's formal reactions to the latest monetary policy announced by the central bank Thursday. Bangladesh Bank announced a 'cautious' monetary policy for July-December of FY 2007-08, indicating an encouragement to banks to raise their interest rates further. The private think-tank asked the central bank to review the monetary policy and keep up private-sector growth. Bhattacharya suggested that the government go for reducing the systems loss in the energy sector that he felt would enhance government revenues without affecting consumers. He said that the first quarter of the current fiscal year was very important being likely to cement a good base at the beginning. But the government move to raise energy prices might have provided a very bad start to the current fiscal year, the CPD executive boss predicted. "I don't see any ground to listen to the IMF advice. Balance of payments is in positive mood. So there is no reason to surrender to the IMF and WB policies for loans," he said. The CPD also criticised the government for a clear lack of coordination in its fiscal, trade and monetary policies, which it said might hamper reaping benefit from the ongoing reforms as well as achieving the GDP growth target of 7.0 percent for the current fiscal year. "The monetary policy shows that the caretaker government is leaning more towards a donor-driven policy than a national consensus to contain the price hike of essentials," Bhattacharya said. He said: "This policy was supposed to be announced before the budget," he said. "How the policy would be reflected in the budget in not clear." The CPD further said that hike in lending rates would surely hamper private sector growth. Bhattacharya said that the government should cut its borrowing to facilitate more loans to the private sector. Referring to the poor investment scenario in the country, the CPD said that the BB should take measures, including a cut in bank rates to utilise the huge Tk 10,000 crore surplus liquidity in the market. bd
