 Mahbub Alam Ronnie bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com) Prices of different brands of powdered milk have increased 29 to 47 percent over the past year, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) Thursday. The exorbitant price hike of powdered milk has compelled many to forego their daily intake of a cup as a nutritional supplement. But even the most unwilling are compelled to buy a can or sachet when the kids keep wailing for their feed. The TCB price lists of commodities published Thursday said that during the past year, major brands of powdered milk saw price increases varying from 29 to 47 per cent. In effect, the retail market prices are a little higher than those posted in the TCB lists. Retailers in Dhaka were found selling a two-kg tin of DANO for Tk 970 to 1000, Diploma one-kg packet for Tk 400 to 410 and Milk Vita one-kg pack for Tk 400-410 Friday. Baby food Lactogen 400 gm tins were selling at Tk 285 to 300 and Biomil at Tk 295 to 300. Dhaka New Market grocer Harunur Rashid told bdnews24.com, "The prices of powdered milk have been increasing every week following fuel price hikes and devaluation of the taka." Asha Abdur Rouf, a mother living in Uttara told bdnews24.com,"Look at the pace powdered milk prices have been spiralling; kids will soon have to be fed plain water instead of milk if things are not checked right now." "The government doesn't seem much perturbed at all; they are bothered about the prices of other commodities, but milk prices do not seem to bother them." bdnews24.
