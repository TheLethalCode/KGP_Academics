<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)  Controversial High Court judge Faisal Mahmud Faizee, who is facing charges of LLB certificate forgery, stepped down Thursday. He addressed his resignation letter to President Iajuddin Ahmed. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed confirmed the news to bdnews24.com, but refused to comment on the issue. Another official with the Supreme Court who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue said Faizee had to "bow out" as the Supreme Judicial Council piled "strong evidence of forgery" against him. A person close to Faizee told bdnews24.com minutes past Thursday midnight: "He met the chief justice at 2:30pm to hand his resignation." But chief justice Md Ruhul Amin asked him to submit the letter to the SC registrar. It has been learnt that Faizee in his resignation letter blamed an unnamed section for spreading propaganda against him. In the letter, he said he had stepped down to uphold the dignity of the Supreme Court. In a desperate bid to hold on to his job, Faizee had decided to slug it out in court and filed a writ petition challenging the CU decision. On March 19, the HC stayed CU's certificate scrapping. Meanwhile, Iajuddin had directed the Supreme Judicial Council to open an investigation into the allegations of forgery against Faizee. The allegations of forgery against Faizee surfaced in October 2004, but the then chief justice did not take any step to assign the council despite strong demand from lawyers. On March 3, the syndicate of Chittagong University stripped Faizee of his LLB certificate, which the university said was forged. On March 10, the university authorities published a gazette on the cancellation of certificates of 50 former students including Justice Faizee. After the syndicate decision was published in newspapers on March 4, Faizee appealed for one-day leave. The following day he made another appeal to extend his leave until March 15. Again on March 15 he made a third appeal to extend his leave until March 25. He did not make a further appeal for leave extension. Faizee was appointed to the High Court on Aug 22, 2004. For the second time in the country's modern history, the Supreme Judicial Council was dealing with allegations against a judge. In 2004, the council was assigned to investigate charges against the then judge Syed Shahidur Rahman. Shahidur had been removed from the job on the basis of council recommendations. bdnews24.com/s
