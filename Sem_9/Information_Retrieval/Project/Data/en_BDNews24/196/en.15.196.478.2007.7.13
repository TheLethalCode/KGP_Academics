<TITLE> For 22 years, 12 Jagannath University halls in wrong hands </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Land-grabbers, local commissioners, influential groups and student leaders have kept 12 dormitories of Jagannath University (JU) unlawfully occupied for the last 22 years. University authorities have failed to handle the illegal occupants of the hostels meant for university students. Most of the current JU teachers and students do not even know the number of the university halls or what state they are in. Those who know just keep their mouths shut. "We have formed a high-powered inventory committee and engaged a chartered accounting firm to look into the hall documents. Once we get their reports, we'll move to restore their possession," Sirajul Islam Khan, the vice chancellor, said. University officials preferring anonymity said after founding Jagannath College in 1884, authorities purchased two houses for use as dormitories and took lease of the rest. Of them, eight were built before 1971 and four after independence. The officials said clashes between hall students and local hooligans in February 1985 left the students evicted from the halls. The hooligans rampaged the halls of residence before torching them. Later, the education ministry officials twice visited the halls. The students, however, were not allowed to stay in the halls, which halls were occupied mostly by outsiders excepting a few student leaders kowtowing the grabbers-miscreants. The authorities filed cases in a bid to restore the possession of the halls and won them. But for reasons inexplicable, the authorities did never get the possession of the hostels back. In 2005, Jagannath University project director professor Ayesha Shirin and former planning secretary visited the university. They asked the deputy commissioner (DC) of Dhaka Abdul Bari to restore possession of the halls on the university's behalf . They also instructed additional district commissioner (ADC) Delwar Hossain to submit a completion report. But the orders were not obeyed. Incumbent VC Sirajul Islam Khan has visited the halls and formed an inventory committee, which also has not come up with anything to show for. The students launched several movements for restoring the halls, but the authorities somehow managed to not take any concrete step. Following is a situation report on the 12 dormitories. 1. Bazlur Rahman Hall The hall is located at 26, Mogaltuli. A school sits there. On March 26, 2006, former BNP education state minister Ehsanul Hoque Milan inaugurated the school. The school is supervised by Hosen Molla, commissioner of ward 71 of Dhaka City Corporation. 2. Shahid Anwar Shafik Hall The hall has been converted into a storage-cum-business facility. The total size of the land there measures one bigha. The hall was demolished and the land was divided under individual ownership.

One part belongs to National Credit and Commerce Bank, Babu Bazaar Branch and the other part to Hazi Abul Bashar and Saleha Begum. There is a shop too named Sonargaon Transport and the shopowner is Moktar Hazi. The hall super in charge was professor Md Basunia. 3.
