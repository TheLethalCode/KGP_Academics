<TITLE> Thai army detains 342 Muslims in southern raids </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Thai army said on Friday it had detained 342 Muslims, including seven women, in raids in the rebellious far south, one of the largest series of arrests in more than three years of separatist violence. Human rights group criticised the move, saying it exposed detainees to potential abuses by the army, which is operating under martial law that grants soldiers immunity from prosecution. The detainees were taken for questioning to five army camps across the four southern provinces where more than 2,300 people have been killed in a three-year insurgency. Army spokesman Colonel Acra Tiproch said in a statement the detainees, who can be kept without charge for 28 days under emergency security laws, would be freed if found not to have been involved in the violence. Samples of their DNA would be kept on record. Since taking office last year following a bloodless coup, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont has fought off pressure from Thailand's Buddhist majority to take stronger action in the Muslim, Malay-speaking region, saying he remains committed to a peaceful resolution. He has apologised for the harsh policies of his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra, and promised restraint in dealing with the violence. But he has had no more success than Thaksin in dampening the violence in the region, which is a former Muslim sultanate annexed by Thailand about a century ago. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- S.Africa communist leaders oppose split with ANC By Paul Simao JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Reuters) - The leadership of South Africa's communist party has signalled it wants to stay allied to the ruling African National Congress rather than contest elections independently, as proposed by some of its members. Disenchantment with the centrist, pro-market policies of South African President Thabo Mbeki has fuelled support among the SACP rank-and-file for a split from the coalition that has governed since the end of white minority rule in 1994. A proposal to run a separate slate of candidates in the 2009 elections was put forth at the party's national congress this week but quickly sidelined by the SACP's powerful central committee, which recommended that no action be taken. SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande dismissed the idea as something favoured by the country's business elite, who would like to see government policy even less influenced by communists and the country's powerful trade union movement. "These are ideologues who reduce politics to the market place of election day choice," Nzimande said on Thursday in a speech to delegates at the congress in Port Elizabeth. "Those who were nowhere to be seen during decades of struggle now preach to the SACP about having the 'courage to stand on its own'," he said, according to a text of the speech. Although the party's membership has ballooned to about 50,000 in the past five years, SACP leaders have questioned whether it would have the resources and support to remain a vibrant force in the political arena. Through its alliance with the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), SACP officials sit in the cabinet as well as on the ANC's National Executive Committee, the party's top decision-making body. Splitting from the alliance would force Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula and Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils among others to either quit the government or renounce their party affiliations. Analysts believe the SACP is likely, instead, to try to tilt the ANC-led alliance toward the left by pressuring it to embrace nationalisation and greater redistribution of income to fight poverty and unemployment. Nationalising petrochemical firm Sasol and Mittal Steel SA were among the ideas proposed by the SACP leadership this week. Communists and trade unionists have sharply criticised Mbeki for moving away from the ANC's pre-apartheid socialist roots and putting in place policies they say have disproportionately favoured the business community, foreign investors and a small black elite. They also have been critical of Mbeki, who himself flirted with communism during the anti-apartheid era, for sacking popular former Deputy President Jacob Zuma in 2005 during an arms procurement scandal. The ANC is expected to choose a new party president at a congress in December, with the winner likely to become South Africa's president when Mbeki steps down in 2009. Mbeki is constitutionally prohibited from running for a third term as national president, although he could try to remain on as head of the ANC, which would give him a large say over the direction of the alliance. The SACP and COSATU have been pushing for a radically different type of leader, possibly Zuma. Their efforts, however, have antagonised Mbeki, who warned the allies last month at an ANC policy conference not to meddle in his party's affai
