 WASHINGTON, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Iraqi government has made mixed progress in meeting political and security goals, a US official said on Thursday, citing a report that may add to rising calls for a change of course in the unpopular. war. The report, to be released shortly, grades the Iraqi government as satisfactory on eight of 18 goals set by the US Congress. It showed that on eight of the benchmarks, Baghdad's performance was unsatisfactory, and mixed on two others.

Richard Lugar have parted ways with the president. The White House is worried other Republicans may join them. Bush on Wednesday met with Republican leaders to try to calm dissent before the assessment of the security situation in Iraq. Doubts also lingered about the readiness of Iraqi security forces to assume a greater role from US forces, crucial to any future drawdown of American troops. In May, Congress agreed to continue funding the war for now but demanded Bush certify on July 15 and again on Sept. 15 that the Iraqis were living up to their political promis
