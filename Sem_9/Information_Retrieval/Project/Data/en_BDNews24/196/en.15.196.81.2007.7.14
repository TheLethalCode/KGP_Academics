 MELBOURNE, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Aborigines rallied in peaceful marches around the country on Saturday to protest against the government's intervention in local communities in the outback Northern Territory. About 150 Aborigines marched to Sydney town hall, angry about the way Prime Minister John Howard responded to a recent report that found widespread sexual abuse in aboriginal communities. Howard has sent police and troops into aboriginal camps in the Northern Territory, where his national government has jurisdiction, to stop the binge drinking, abuse and violence which is believed to be destroying aboriginal families. Aboriginal leaders admit that some of their communities have a problem with child sexual abuse, but say Howard is being heavy handed. Aboriginal leader Pat Turner told the Sydney protesters that intervention for a period of six months would be acceptable, but it had to be done in partnership with indigenous communities. "Leave the police at home, leave the soldiers at home, and let the real workers come in," she said. Protests were also taking place on Saturday in the other Australian state capitals and in Alice Springs, an outback town with a large aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. Australia's 460,000 Aborigines make up two percent of the 21 million population, most living in remote communities or towns.
