 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government Thursday appointed chairmen and members to the Chittagong Hill Tracts' three district councils. CHT affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had earlier approved the 'interim' appointments of the new chairmen and members to Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban district councils. The ministry issued the circular Thursday regarding the new appointments in the five-member district councils in line with the Hill District Council Act 1989. In the past each successive government has made new 'interim' appointments to these posts. Ministry officials said the present caretaker government has also made the new appointments in keeping with tradition. There exists a High Court order however to hold district council elections within 120 days from the 'interim' appointments. Past political governments have invariably appointed pre-nominated councils without election. It remains to be seen whether the elections will be held under the present regime. Jagatjyoti Chakma was appointed chairman of Rangamati District Council and Ratiknata Tanchangya, Aung Sui Chhain Chowdhury, Bihari Ranjan Chakma and Md Moniruzzaman Mohsin have been appointed as its members. Khagrachhari District Council chairman Monindra Lal Tripura retained his post and Animesh Dewan, Sanu Mong Marma, Muithi Karbari and Md Abu Bakar Siddique were appointed members to the council. Professor Thanjama Lusai was appointed chairman of Bandarban District Council. The members of the council are Thomas Sangtual Bom, Ching Sa Pru, U Nu Shai Pru and Md Aminur Rashid. bdnew
