 Jannatul Ferdaus bdnews24.com DU Correspondent Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  A great many Dhaka University teachers are resorting to fraud and plagiarism to get their work published in journals to get promotion. There is evidence that the same piece of work gets submitted for publication more than once by changing the title of the article and claiming it as an original work. The teachers are also using various means to persuade the editors of journals to include works which are not worth publication. Using political and personal influence they gather references from their seniors that their works are worth publication and then present these works to back up their promotions. As a result of these sub-standard works, journals published by different departments of the university are losing their academic reputation and prestige. These journals are now simply serving as the first step of a ladder to dubious promotion for the teachers of the university. The editors of the journals themselves are unable to deny that this is the case. Professor Nehal Karim of DU's department of sociology told bdnews24.com, "Only one quarter of the works submitted to journals are currently worth publication. The rest are published only for the sake of promotion of the teachers." Professor Abdul Momin Chowdhury of the university's history department and a former editor of a journal also admitted the widespread nature of such practices. "When I was an editor only those works that were worthy of publication were printed. The editors were professional and efficient in those days. Now journal editors are selected through a ballot process," he said. He told bdnews24.com how deans of departments become editor of the journals now by using their powers to maintain a vote bank or to garner votes. According to Prof Chowdhury, it is through the democratisation of the process of selecting the editor and the board of editors that the deans have gained control of the journals. As a result, the journals are now used for personal gain and to serve political interests, according to the professor. "As the teachers promotions are based on publication of their works in the recognised journals, various methods of persuasion take place to get a work published in these journals," he said. "Now the question is being raised about the quality of the articles published in the journals of the social science and arts faculties." Prof Chowdhury also made the point that not sending the articles to reviewers outside the university was a serious failing and a prime cause for the situation. Dean of the law faculty and editor of the faculty journal Professor Borhanuddin Khan said: "Editing of journals is done purely for the sake of the work." He added there was no other benefit or official compensation for editing or working for academic journals. Professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury, formerly of DU's English department, said: "There are absolutely no standards for the articles published in the journals." As a result, the teachers are easily able to get a high number of published articles for their promotion, he said. "The journals are part of the academic life of the university. So the teachers should be creating a positive environment for good writing to increase the level of their knowledge," he added. Said Prof Chowdhury, "If the quality of the journals are to be improved the editors should not be changed so frequently. An editor plays the most important role in increasing the quality of a journal." In 2000, public administration department's teacher Dr Mosleh Uddin Ahmed was caught resorting to fraud regarding a published article. Though the committee formed to investigate the incident recommended penalising him he went unpunished. ] He went on to become vice chancellor of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology during the previous government. Member of the investigation committee Professor Mohammad Mohabbat Khan said: "There was clear evidence of fraud in Mosleh Uddin's publication. The enquiry committee recommended suspension of his promotion for five years and not to promote him before five more quality articles were published in international journals." An assistant professor of the sociology department, Md Jahangir Alam, also gained promotion through fraudulent means. He was found guilty after a fellow teacher of the department, Md Moshiur Rahman, filed a case against Alam with the High Court. Although Alam later appealed, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court verdict. Alam is currently pursuing further studies at the Asian Institute of Technology. One reviewer of articles, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com: "An article by Professor Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan of the Department of Political Science was published in a journal edited by Professor Anwarullah Chowdhury despite objections by the reviewers." Prof Bhuiyan had allegedly plagiarised the work of a colleague, Professor Talukder Moniruzzaman, according to the reviewer, who himself had recommended against publishing the article for this reason. However, publication went ahead and Bhuiyan was made professor. Professor AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed has reviewed many articles for publication in journals. He does not speak highly of the present quality of work submitted to journals. "Now most of the articles are sub-standard." "Many teachers simply submit tutorial papers for publication as works of 'research,'" he added. He described plagiarismcopying another's work and passing it off as someone's ownas a "moral offence". "It is an intellectual offence and a crime against the nation," he added. Former chairman of the University Grants Commission Professor M Asaduzzaman was an editor of the journal of the social sciences faculty. He confirmed that articles were published despite objections from the reviewers. "Often such articles are published due to political pressure." He also admitted that he had been forced to publish 32 articles as the journal's editor despite their lacking required substance. "The teachers never discuss the journals in their classes. As a result, the students know nothing about them. "Journals are losing their academic status and their relevance for the students and becoming just a tool for the promotion of the teachers." bdnews24.
