<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Thursday rolled out a revised 14-point reform proposal with its focus on formation of a national security council. The proposal bars a person from holding the office of secretary general for more than two straight terms. On June 25, Bhuiyan had announced a draft proposal that said the party chairperson could not hold office for more than two terms on the trot. It however had no word on the secretary general. Bhuiyan announced the fresh proposal from a press conference at his Gulshan home at 5:00pm, an hour behind schedule. He stressed amendment to the constitution and the codes of conduct of the parliament to make it effective. He also made some proposals to ensure an effective opposition in the parliament. According to the Bhuiyan's proposals, there would be two deputy speakers in the parliamentone from the ruling party and the other from the opposition. There would be a freeze on boycott of parliament by the opposition and lawmakers absent for 30 working days in the parliament will lose their membership, he said. The BNP leader said the plan would be placed at the next council meeting of the party. "Process of holding the council is ongoing. We will go to party chairperson for permission for council once the preparation is complete." On a national security council, Bhuiyan said such councils in the US, UK, Thailand, Pakistan, India and some other countries succeeded in striking a balance in the governing system. The council will help uphold sovereignty, ensure security, maintain law and order, protect energy and water resources of the country, he said. Appointment of an ombudsman is also among the proposals. Bhuiyan discussed reforms with former BNP lawmakers and district leaders of Chittagong Division earlier in the day. He advised the former lawmakers to talk to grassroots leaders about the upcoming council meeting. bdnews24.com/s
