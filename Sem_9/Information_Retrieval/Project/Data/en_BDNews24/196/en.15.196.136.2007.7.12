 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Skype is now available on the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet, bringing free conversations anywhere in the world with wireless internet connection. "Consumers can now start enjoying the benefits of Skype on the Nokia N800 and experience a free and easy way to stay in touch with friends, family and business colleagues around the world," said Nokia's vice president Ari Virtanen Wednesday. "Skype is the recognized leader in internet calling, with more than 196 million registered users worldwide," he said. "The Nokia N800 gives people easy access to the Internet and it's a natural step that they will want to make Skype calls away from their desktop." "Our users are no longer just using Skype on their computer desktops," said Skype's head of mobile business development Eric Lagier. He said with the growth of mobile devices and WiFi, consumers expect to be connected wherever they are, at the office, at home or on the move. "Making Skype available on such an innovative, portable device lets us bring internet conversations to the mobile masses," Lagier said. Users download Skype software to make free voice and video calls and send instant messages over the Internet, between Skype users. Skype also offers paid-for services which let users make and forward calls to landlines and mobile phones at low per-minute rates. To enhance the Skype user experience, leading manufacturers such as Nokia have developed products that give users the additional flexibility to place and receive Skype calls wherever they are. Skype sets conversations free by providing new and easy ways to stay in touch over the internet. Millions of people every day make free Skype-to-Skype voice and video calls and send instant messages using our software. Some pay a little per minute for long-distance and international calls to phones and mobiles and for SMS, voicemail and call forwarding. Or they buy plans that give unlimited calls nationwide. bdn
