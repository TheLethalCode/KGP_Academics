 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's players have rejected the idea that Argentina will start as favourites in Sunday's Copa America final. Argentina have brought a full strength-team and have cruised to the final, scoring 16 goals on their way to winning all five games. Brazil, on the other hand, kicked off with a 2-0 defeat against Mexico and needed a penalty shootout to beat Uruguay in their semi-final. The defending champions are also without Kaka and Ronaldinho, who asked to be rested from the tournament. "We can't talk about favourites before the game has even started," said midfielder Elano. "These are two great teams. Anything can happen on the day." Anderson said: "They have excellent players with excellent quality but so do Brazil." Assistant coach Jorginho also shrugged off the idea that Brazil start as underdogs. "A final is a final," said the 1994 World Cup winner. "Names alone won't win the game. We feel fine and confident. We will see who are the favourites on the pitch." Brazil met Argentina in the final in similar circumstances three years ago in Peru. On that occasion, Argentina were also favourites and Brazil were missing several regular players. Despite that, Brazil forced a 2-2 draw and then won on penalties. "We've suffered a lot to get here," said midfielder Diego. "The target is the same as usual, to be champions. There are a lot of coincidences and we have to take the positive things onto the pitch." "We hope to obtain the same success as last time. There are no favourites.
