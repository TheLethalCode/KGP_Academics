 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnnews24.com)Farmers enduring a fertiliser crisis took to the streets in two districts Thursday, triggering clashes with police. bdnews24.com reports on a violent skirmish Thursday between police and fertiliser-hungry farmers in Godagari, Rajshahi leaving at least 12 people injured, while on the same day in Monpura, Bhola, farmers laid siege to their local agricultural office. Local farmers in Bidirbur, Godagari upazila, demanding more fertiliser began their protest at 11.30am, according to witnesses. When police came onto the scene they obstructed the farmers triggering the clash. Locals told bdnews24.com that police charged with batons to disperse the farmers. In retaliation the farmers threw brickbats at the police. Reports say 12 persons including two police constables were injured in the clash. The identities of the injured have not been confirmed. Godagari police station's officer in charge Mohiuddin claimed that the situation had quickly been brought under control. In Monpura in the district of Bhola, farmers blockaded the local agricultural office Thursday to protest the fertiliser crisis. The agitating farmers were reported to have calmed down when the upazila nirbahi officer assured them of an increased supply of fertiliser. Local witnesses said the farmers laid siege to the office of the agriculture officer adjacent to the Upazila Parishad at 10am. Police and UNO rushed to the scene. UNO Aminur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the farmers ceased their agitation when they were assured that nine metric tonnes of urea fertilizer would arrive in Monpura Thursday evening and another 40 tonnes would be delivered Friday. Rahman also claimed there was no fertiliser crisis in the upazila. Monpura police officer in charge Abdul Hannan said: "Police rushed to the spot on hearing that the farmers had besieged the UNO office demanding fertiliser." Upazila agriculture officer Swapan Kumar Khan told bdnews24.com: "In Monpura 12,000 hectares of land have been planted with aus this season." However, only 18 tonnes of urea fertiliser was supplied in June against demand for 60 tonnes for June and July, creating a fertiliser crisis in the area. bdnews24.co
