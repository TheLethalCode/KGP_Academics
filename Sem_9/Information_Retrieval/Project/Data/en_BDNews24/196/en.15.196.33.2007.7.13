 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bankers Friday warned of reduced lending capacity of banks if the central bank increases the rates on reserves or statutory liquidity ratios to mop up about Tk 10,000 crore surplus liquidity from the market. The move may see banks raise interest rates, resulting in the decline of credit flow to the private sector and affecting investment. "The lending capacity of banks will reduce if the central bank raises the SLRs. But the increase in SLRs will help bring down money supply and dampen inflationary expectations," said Aminur Rahman, managing director of state-run Sonali Bank, country's largest bank. Bangladesh Bank Thursday took a tight monetary policy stance for the July -December period of the fiscal 2007-08. It hinted at an increase in the present rate of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and cash reserve ratios. Since 2005, banks have to maintain a total of 18 percent (SLR 13 percent and CRR 5.0 percent) as reserves with the Bangladesh Bank. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed in unveiling the plan said money supply in the market has increased. Total surplus liquidity now stands at Tk 9,517 crore. According to the central bank, yearly growth of money supply, a key economic indicator to forecast inflation, stood at 18.2 percent, far exceeding the target of 14.7 percent until June. A managing director of private bank, speaking in return for anonymity, said reduction in the loan-worthy funds due to increase in SLR and CRR will encourage banks to raise the interest rates on the lending. "I think there will be no major immediate knock-on effect. Banks now have surplus funds due to low investment demand for credits," said AH Tawfique Ahmed, former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank. But Dr M Asaduzzaman, research director at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, differs with the central bank's restrained monetary stance. "Inflation here is not demand-driven; rather it is driven by supply. Inflation cannot be controlled supply side issues unaddressed," he said. He also said the tight monetary policy will affect the liquidity of the banks and more worryingly, reduce credit flow to the private sector. "It will affect the economy in the longer term," he said.  Asaduzzaman referred to the coming Ramadan to say the central bank should now start facilitating opening of letters of credits to facilitate import of essential commodities to keep the prices stable. bdnew
