 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank Thursday announced a "cautious" monetary policy in the July-December period of fiscal 2007-08, indicating a further rise in policy rates to keep yearly inflation within 6.5-7.0 percent. It observed inflation as a major challenge to the economy and said it will 'revisit' rates on policy instruments such as statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)/cash reserve ratio (CRR), an amount a bank has to maintain with the central bank, and review short-term interest rates on repo, reverse repo and treasury bills. The BB also asked banks to bring down interest rates on lending to ensure adequate credit flow to the private sector, although analysts say the latest move by the central bank would encourage banks to raise their interest rates. To ensure private sector-led growth, it also said it would take special measures to ensure credit flows to the private sector. "Inflation is a major challenge now. We will continue our present cautious stance with emphasis on job creations and on economic growth," said central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, unveiling the fourth issue of half-yearly monetary policy without giving details. In the 18 months to June 2007, Bangladesh Bank maintained a restrained monetary policy aimed at limiting annual inflation to 7.0 percent amid an increase in money supply and high inflationary expectations. Yearly inflation however went over BB's target and touched 7.06 percent in May. Ahmed expected inflation to come down to a tolerable level in coming days if the supply side factors work smoothly. "A harmonisation of monetary and fiscal policies is also necessary for price stability," he said. Concerned over government borrowing that went higher than the targeted level of last fiscal year, BB observed that yearly growth of money supply, a key economic indicator to forecast inflation, stood at 18.2 percent, exceeding its target to keep within 14.7 percent until June. Credit flow to the private sector also went up to 15.6 percent, up from the target of 13.9 percent in the previous monetary policy. "We will tighten those loose areas," he said referring to about Tk 10,000 crore in surplus liquidity in the market. Ahmed said they would revisit interest rates on short-term policy instruments such as repo, reverse repo, treasury bills. Interest rates on long-term government treasury bonds will also be rationalised considering the rates offered to repo and reverse repos, he said. "It would not be required if the secondary bond market is developed enough," he said. "We will also revisit present SLR for banks, including SLRs for Islami shriah-based banks," the governor said, citing neighbouring countries' such as India's example in raising SLRs. At present, interest rates on 1-2 day repo and reverse repos are 9.25 percent and 6.5 percent. However, the rates for CRR/SLR for banks have remained unchanged since 2005. All banks, except for Islami-shariah banks, have to maintain 18 percent as SLR/CRR with the central bank. Islami-shariah banks require to keep a 10 percent SLR/CRR. bd
