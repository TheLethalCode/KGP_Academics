<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Police dawdled Friday to escort Sheikh Hasina to a city hospital in the morning to see the body of a party colleague, witnesses and party sources said. The Awami League chief was scheduled to visit National Medical College and Hospital where the adviser to Dhaka City committee, Moazzem Hossain, died at the age of 80 late Thursday. She could not initially come out of her Sudha Sadan home as the escort team did not arrive on schedule. The former prime minister had planned to leave her Dhanmondi home at 10:00am for the hospital but the security team was not around until 10:15am. Hasina decided to go on her own with no escort but security outside the home was heightened apparently to prevent her motorcade to drive away, according to witnesses. At 10:15am, Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain and patrol inspector Mohammad Rajib informed Hasina's personal assistant Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury that Hasina could not be allowed to leave the home without the police escort. The escort team arrived in Sudha Sadan at 11:00 am after Hasina decided to walk to the hospital. She finally left with police escort at 11:10 am. Hasina reportedly was angry at the authorities allegedly trying to bar her from visiting the hospital. "Which country do we live in? My party colleague has died but they will not allow me to see the body!" a relative quoted Hasina as saying when she consoled the family of the late leader at the hospital. Hasina showed her last respect by placing wreaths at the coffin of the leader. The coffin was later draped by the party and national flags. bdnews24.com
