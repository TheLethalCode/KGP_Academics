 SEOUL, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tanker carrying fuel oil docked at a North Korean port on Saturday as a team of international inspectors was due to arrive ahead of a planned shutdown of the country's nuclear reactor under a disarmament deal. North Korea said last week it would consider suspending the operation of its nuclear facilities as soon as it received the first shipment of oil from South Korea under the Feb. 13 aid-for-disarmament deal. Officials in Seoul have said they expected Pyongyang to live up to its pledges. The South Korean tanker "9 Hanchang" carrying 6,200 tonnes of fuel oil arrived at the port of Sonbong at 4:00 a.m. (1900 GMT, Friday) on the northeastern coast of North Korea, a Unification Ministry spokesman said. That is the first of 50,000 tonnes of oil North Korea will receive under the February agreement in return for shutting down its reactor and allowing in a team of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to monitor the shutdown. It will be the first time the North's nuclear activities will be under outside surveillance since 2002. The inspectors said they would be going straight to work. "We are en route to Yongbyon facilities," the chief of the IAEA group, Adel Tolba, told reporters at Beijing airport before boarding a flight to Pyongyang. "We have our equipment with us. We will resume our work when we arrive." He confirmed the technical team would go to Yongbyon plant Saturday. The Yongbyon reactor is the source of North Korea's weapons-grade plutonium. The head of the UN nuclear agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has said it would take about a month to complete setting up the monitoring equipment, which he said should go without a glitch. The United States in 2002 accused North Korea of operating a covert uranium enrichment programme in violation of a 1994 pact on scrapping nuclear activities in return for two relatively proliferation-resistant reactors. Annual fuel shipments as part of that deal were suspended in late 2002, leading to its collapse and prompting Pyongyang to expel IAEA inspectors and restart the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which houses the reactor and fuel reprocessing facilities. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test last year, which officials and experts in Seoul say was a failure, but has agreed at six-country talks to end its nuclear arms programme in return for aid and better diplomatic ties with the world. The talks by South and North Korea, Russia, Japan, the United States and China are set to resume on Wednesday to map out the next stage of disabling the North's nuclear programme.
