 BEIJING, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poisonous gas has trapped 20 people in a coal mine in Shanxi province, the heart of China's coal industry, the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. Workers were clearing a mine pit to investigate a previous accident when the gas leaked at dawn, trapping two rescue workers, two mine safety workers, and 16 miners, Xinhua said, citing the provincial mine safety administration. China's coal mining industry is the world's deadliest, claiming 4,746 lives last year or an average of 13 a day. The trapped workers had been investigating a June flood at the mine in Hejin which killed 9 miners and was originally covered up by the mine owner, Xinhua said. In the first half of this year, managers covered up 46 work accidents in which 205 people died, Xinhua said, citing the State Administration of Work Safety.
