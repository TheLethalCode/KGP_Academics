 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Alfio Basile has named unchanged team for Sunday's Copa America final against arch-rivals Brazil. Basile said Saturday that Carlos Tevez would partner Lionel Messi in attack while Hernan Crespo, who has recovered from a sprained thigh muscle, would start on the bench. "It was an easy decision, Tevez has been playing and he has done well while Crespo has not played for 12 days," said Basile. Crespo, who has scored three goals in the tournament, sprained a muscle as he converted a penalty in a 4-2 win over Colombia in Argentina's second game. "Crespo has done a fantastic job to recover and so has the medical team," added Basile. Team: Roberto Abbondanzieri; Javier Zanetti, Roberto Ayala, Gabriel Milito, Gabriel Heinze; Javier Mascherano, Juan Sebastian Veron, Esteban Cambiasso, Juan Roman Riquelme; Lionel Messi, Carlos Teve
