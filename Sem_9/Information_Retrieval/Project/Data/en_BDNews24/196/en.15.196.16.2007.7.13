 RAMALLAH, Fri Jul 13, West Bank (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejigged his government on Friday at the end of a month-long state of emergency declared when Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip. Responding to a constitutional limit on any state of emergency of 30 days that ends at midnight (2100 GMT), Abbas swore in three new ministers and Salam Fayyad was preparing to resign and be reappointed as prime minister, presidential aides said. That will put the government formed after Abbas dismissed its Hamas-led predecessor on June 14 on a new legal footing, though it may not address all criticisms by some lawyers who have argued that Abbas's actions needed parliamentary approval -- though the legislature has been paralyzed by the crisis. The appointment of new ministers by the Western-backed president and the resignation and reappointment of the cabinet effectively creates a new government to replace the one formed under Fayyad on an emergency basis after forces loyal to Abbas's secular Fatah faction were routed by Hamas fighters in Gaza. "Salam Fayyad will resign along with his government this evening," Abbas media adviser Nabil Amr said. "He will then be reappointed so there will no longer be an emergency government." "It was agreed to distribute the heavy workload by adding ... ministers to the government. Then it can go to parliament for a vote of confidence -- if there's a quorum," Agriculture and Social Affairs Minister Mahmoud al-Habbash told Reuters. "The president is very keen that all his steps should be legal. He and the prime minister want to expand the current government," an Abbas aide said in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Fatah remains dominant. Leading lawyers who drafted the Palestinian Basic Law, an interim constitution, had argued that Abbas had the right to dismiss Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh as prime minister, but not to appoint an entire new cabinet without legislative approval -- nor the right to suspend parts of the constitution by decree. Haniyeh, who still considers himself prime minister, told worshippers at a Gaza mosque on Friday that the president was failing to seek parliamentary approval. He also renewed Hamas's call for dialogue to end a schism that many Palestinians feel has jeopardized their hopes of establishing a state. But Haniyeh rejected conditions Abbas has set for talks: "We want dialogue but we will not beg for dialogue." Abbas's supporters argue that parliament -- the Palestinian Legislative Council -- has been paralyzed by Hamas and therefore the president must manage his administration without it. Hamas, whose election victory 18 months ago led to an international embargo on the Palestinian Authority, points out that more than half of its majority bloc have been arrested by Israel. The remainder failed to attend a session on Wednesday, ensuring there was no quorum to begin a new legislative year. Fayyad, a US-trained economist, has strong Western support and leads a largely technocratic cabinet that is backed by Fatah but which is formally made up of independents. Two of the three new ministers are academics, one is a women's rights advocate. Fayyad was finance minister in a Hamas-Fatah unity government formed in March to try to ease the international embargo on Haniyeh's previous Hamas administration. Western powers and Israel shun Hamas for its support for violence and have restored financial flows to Abbas's administration in the West Bank while tightening the isolation of the Gaza Str
