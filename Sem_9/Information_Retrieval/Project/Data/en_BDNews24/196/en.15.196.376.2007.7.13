<TITLE> Woman held in UK bomb plot released without charge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police said on Thursday they had released without charge the only woman among the eight suspects held in the case of failed bomb attacks in London and Glasgow last month. The woman was the wife of suspect Mohammed Asha, 26, arrested with him on June 30 while the pair drove on a motorway in northern England, hours after attackers drove a jeep into an airport terminal building in Scotland and set it ablaze. That attack came 36 hours after the discovery of two cars packed with fuel, gas tanks and nails primed to explode near a crowded nightclub in London. Police think the two incidents were linked. All the suspects are medics from the Middle East or India. One, Iraqi-trained doctor Bilal Abdulla, 27, was charged last week with conspiring to cause explosions. Indian doctor Kafeel Ahmed, 27, is under police guard badly burned in hospital. Four other suspects, including Ahmed's brother Maqbool, are held at a central London police station. Another suspect is being held by police in Australia. British police can hold terrorism suspects up to 28 days without charge, but must periodically seek permission of a judge to continue questioning them.
