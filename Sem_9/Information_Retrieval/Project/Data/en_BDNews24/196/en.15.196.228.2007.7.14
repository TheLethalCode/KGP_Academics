<TITLE> Starbucks finds imperial palace a forbidding market </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A controversial Starbucks coffee shop in the Forbidden City, the former imperial palace at the heart of Beijing, has closed its doors after years of opposition. A campaign for its closure has been brewing since early this year, when a television anchor complained that the American chain's presence in the symbol of the Chinese nation was trampling on Chinese culture. The outlet opened in 2000 prompting a media backlash so severe that the museum authorities considered revoking its lease after a couple of months. It has operated without the usual outward corporate Starbucks bunting in recent years. "Starbucks shouldn't be here. Why bring something so Western to an ancient place like this?" steamed an Australian tourist who gave his name as Justin. The shop closed Friday. By Saturday morning, newspapers covered the windows while a crew of workers set up a souvenir shop inside. Starbucks was offered the option to revamp the outlet as a "coffee shop" selling domestic coffee and other beverages alongside its own branded brew, but turned down the offer, the Beijing Youth Daily reported citing Palace officials. A Starbucks spokesperson could not be reached for confirmation and calls to the Forbidden City outlet went unanswered. The company's 3,000 international stores include 239 outlets in China, where many competing coffee chains also sport a similar round green logo the the registered Starbucks one. BETTER LATTE THAN NEVER "It's a shame. I would have enjoyed a coffee if they had it," said Sarah from Texas, touring the palace on a cloudy summer weekend. The rectangular Forbidden City, formally known as the Palace Museum, covers 74 hectares (183 acres) surrounded by a moat to the north of Tiananmen Square and has a fabled 9,999 rooms. It was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987. Its outer courtyards are lined with stalls selling trinkets, Olympics souvenirs and drinks, with a makeshift basketball court tucked to one side. The Starbucks was located inside the vast complex, where the museum management also operates cafes and eateries selling coffee, tea and beer. "I don't have a problem with Starbucks, because all the other coffee shops here already make it kind of commercial," said Wu Haiying, who had travelled to Beijing to show the palace to her seven-year-old son. "Why shouldn't we adopt Western things that are good?"
