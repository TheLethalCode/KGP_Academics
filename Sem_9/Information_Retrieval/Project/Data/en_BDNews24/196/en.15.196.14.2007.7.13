 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  A set of new laws designed to raise the ceiling for paid-up capital of insurers and form an Insurance Regulatory Authority to rein in rogue firms, will be in force in a couple of months, a senior commerce ministry official said. The new laws in the offing are Insurance Act 2007, Insurance Regulatory Authority Act and Takaful Act 2007. "I hope these laws will be passed in the form of ordinances to replace those in place and overhaul the regulatory structure," Dr Mahfuzul Haque, chief controller of insurance, told bdnews24.com. The government took the initiative to revive about century-old laws to regulate the Tk 30 billion insurance industry. Companies now operate under the antiquated Insurance Act 1938 and the Insurance Rule 1958. The draft Insurance Act 2007 requires general and life insurance companies to raise their minimum paid-up capital to Tk 25 crore and Tk 15 crore from Tk 15 crore and 7.5 crore. It also provides for a minimum capital requirement for foreign insurance companies doing business in Bangladesh. Insurance companies having paid-up capital less than the specified amount would be allowed reasonable time to get to the ceiling, the draft says. The law also provides for a "protection fund" to safeguard interests of life insurance policyholders. It will make insurance companies extend their businesses in rural areas and social sectors to encourage savings. The law is to restrict the size of the board of directors to 20 and bar a director from working in the company. It, however, will allow companies to branch out and lift restrictions on investment of assets. An Insurance Regulatory Authority formed under the IRA Act 2007 will oversee the companies and safeguard interests of policyholders. The IRA will replace the Department of Insurance. "The Department of Insurance shall stand abolished on the date on which IRA is established. Officer, employee or any other person holding any post in the DoI shall have the right to opt for absorption by the authority," the draft IRA Act says. The IRA, headed by a chairman and having its own funds, will provide registration and renewal approval, suspend or cancel registration, levy fees and impose penalties. It will also look after the issues of amalgamation or merger between companies. A fresh lawTakaful Act 2007 will also come in force for companies doing insurance business based on Islamic Shariah. Currently, there is no rule to regulate such companies. According to the act, existing insurers doing Takaful business shall be disallowed to underwrite conventional businesses or launch such products. Companies that want to do Takaful business will get registration from the IRA, it says. bd
