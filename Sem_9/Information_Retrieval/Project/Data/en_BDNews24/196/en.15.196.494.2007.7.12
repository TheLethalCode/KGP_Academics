 NEW YORK, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actress Claire Danes will make her Broadway debut later this year as Eliza Doolittle in a play that inspired the award-winning musical 'My Fair Lady,' the Roundabout Theatre Company announced on Wednesday. Danes, 28, will star in George Bernard Shaw's 'Pygmalion' opposite Tony Award-winning actor Jefferson Mays as Henry Higgins. Danes will play the role made famous on the screen by Audrey Hepburn in 1964. 'Pygmalion' premiered on Broadway in 1914 and was adapted into the musical 'My Fair Lady' in 1956. The story follows Professor Higgins' bid to transform Doolittle, a poor and uneducated English girl, into a society lady. Danes, who played opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 film version of 'Romeo and Juliet,' will officially debut on October 18 when the play opens for a two-month run. The US actress is currently starring in the arthouse film 'Evening' and will be seen later this year in the big budget fantasy drama 'Stardust.
