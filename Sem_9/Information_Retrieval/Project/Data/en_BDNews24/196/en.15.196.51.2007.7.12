 NEW YORK, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A guest at the Five Gables Inn and Spa in St Michaels, Maryland, abruptly cut short her stay when an issue arose that the hotel's staff couldn't handle: labor. The pregnant woman was taking advantage of Five Gables' 'baby moon' package, one of a growing number of vacation getaways aimed at giving expecting couples one last vacation before parenthood. Marianne Lesher, innkeeper at Five Gables, said that was the only time in the three years since the inn created the popular package that someone has gone into labor. Though the term 'baby moon' originally meant the time parents spend alone with a new baby, in the travel industry it's now widely used to describe expecting parents' last hurrah before baby arrives. Pre-baby vacations are just one example of hotels offering packages celebrating important family events. Packages aimed at new empty nesters and even couples trying to conceive a child are cropping up in hotels in the US and Caribbean as hoteliers cater to people who have more money than time and need to escape hectic lives to focus on milestones. "With affluence doing as well as it is, people have disposable income to celebrate rites of passage," said Tammy Peters, director of public relations for New York's Mandarin Oriental. The Mandarin's baby moon package includes sparkling cider, chocolate-dipped strawberries and spa treatments for expecting parents starting at $2,175 a night. The popularity of offers such as these seems to be growing. W Hotels expanded its baby moon packages nationally in June, after its introduction in New York in 2005. The package, which includes a 'womb' service menu with selections such as ice cream and plate of pickles, has been purchased by about 150 couples. Another reason for the prominence of these packages may be Hollywood's influence, said Jenni Benzaquen, director of public relations for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide's Luxury Brands Group. "I think we've all seen how maternity has been made chic by celebrities like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie," Benzaquen said. LOTS OF ROOM SERVICE For those couples who are trying to make a baby, some resorts are offering so-called procreation vacations with aphrodisiacs and home-made fertility remedies. Starwood's Caribbean locations like the Martineau Bay Resort and Spa and The Westin St. John Resort and Villas provide unlimited sea moss elixirs and pumpkin soup for would-be moms and dads, as well as couples' massages and romantic dinners. The package is aimed at dual-income couples who may want to get away from their stressful everyday lives to conceive, said Bill Thompson, area director of sales for Starwood Hotels Caribbean. Since the resorts launched the package in late 2005, around 40 couples have purchased procreation vacations. The number is not very high, because some people are intimidated by the name and may not want everyone to know their plans, Thompson said. But the procreation package does help generate interest in other romantic, less-goal-oriented, offers that the resorts provide, he added. Not to be left out, there are also packages for those who successfully conceived and gave birth long ago. Arawak Beach Inn in Anguilla has an empty nesters package that includes champagne, dinner and a massage for two. To be eligible for the package, parents must present a paid college tuition bill upon arrival. "They've paid their dues and now it's time to relax, put their feet up and focus on rejuvenating themselves," said Liz Zea, marketing manager for Arawak, about the motivation for creating the packa
