 NAHR AL-BARED, Thu Jul 12, Lebanon (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops shelled a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon on Thursday after al Qaeda-inspired militants killed two soldiers there, security sources said. The army and Fatah al-Islam militants have battled at the coastal Nahr al-Bared camp for nearly eight weeks. At least 207 people have been killed, making it Lebanon's worst internal violence since the 1975-1990 civil war. Security and political sources said on Wednesday the army, concerned about being sucked into a war of attrition, had decided to mount an all-out assault on the camp to root out the militants, who have defied demands that they surrender. Witnesses said the army was bombarding the camp from all sides, often at a rate of 7 to 10 artillery shells per minute. Black smoke billowed from inside the camp's bombed-out, smouldering buildings. But a military source denied that Thursday's fighting was the "decisive" battle. "These are normal daily operations and in response to sniper fire by the Fatah al-Islam militants," he said. "The army's response is in the framework of tightening the noose on remaining elements of Fatah al-Islam inside the camp." But Thursday's fighting was the most ferocious since the Lebanese defense minister declared late last month that all major combat operations had ceased at Nahr al-Bared. Security sources said two Lebanese soldiers were killed by sniper fire in the clashes that started early in the morning, bringing the total army death toll to 89. Seventy-five militants and 43 civilians have also been killed in the fighting that began on May 20. The violence has further undermined stability in Lebanon, where a paralyzing eight-month-old political crisis has been compounded by bombings in and around Beirut. The country has yet to recover from a war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas which erupted exactly a year ago. The government says Fatah al-Islam is a tool of Syria, a charge Damascus and the militants deny. The group says it has no organizational ties with al Qaeda, but supports its ideology. Some of its members -- mainly Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis -- have fought in Iraq. Security sources say at least 10 Saudis are among the dead militan
