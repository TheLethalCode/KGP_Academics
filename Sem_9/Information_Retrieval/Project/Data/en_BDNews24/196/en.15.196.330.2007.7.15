 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia have been given the go-ahead to stage World Cup qualifiers in La Paz even though it lies above the recently established altitude limit of 3,000 metres. The decision, which followed intense lobbying by Bolivian president Evo Morales, was confirmed on Saturday in a statement signed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter and South American Football Confederation (CSF) president Nicolas Leoz. "With the unanimous backing of the CSF, the city of La Paz has been authorised, on this occasion, to host the matches involving the Bolivian national team, in the Hernando Siles stadium," said the statement on the CSF's Web site. The statement added that the ruling applied to qualifying matches for the 2010 World Cup. It said Bolivia had also been asked to build a stadium at a 2,800 metres or below near La Paz if it wanted the administrative capital to continue staging games. In May, FIFA surprisingly announced a ban on international matches at altitudes of more than 2,500 metres, a decision which ruled out games in Bogota and Quito, capitals of Colombia and Ecuador respectively, as well as La Paz. It also thwarted Peru's plans to stage matches in the Andean city of Cusco, at 3,300 metres, instead of the sea level capital of Lima, the country's traditional venue. PERSONAL APPEALS Following a wave of protests across the Andean region, the limit was raised to 3,000 metres in June. However, this still ruled out matches in La Paz, which has traditionally hosted Bolivia's home games. Bolivia's Morales made personal appeals to the CSF directors and to FIFA president Sepp Blatter to make an exception. He also played in matches with his aides on volcanoes at more than 5,000 metres above sea levels in a bid to prove that football could be played at altitude without problems. Brazil's first-ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier was in La Paz in 1993, and they were beaten on their next visit in 2001. However, Bolivia managed to win only three out of nine games in the qualifiers for 2006. The statement confirmed that South America's qualifying competition would involve one group of 10 teams, who would play each other twice. "The venues will be in appropriate stadiums, approved by FIFA and above all where previous World Cup qualifiers have been played," it said. "A change of venue will only be authorised when the climactic and geographical conditions are similar and do not give a sporting advantage to a particular team.
