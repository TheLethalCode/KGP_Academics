<TITLE> Caretaker govt not unconstitutional: Sircar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar Thursday said the present caretaker government's staying in power more than 90 days may have caused some "constitutional irregularities" but the government was "not illegal or unconstitutional". Talking to reporters Thursday, it was the first time the speaker had made a public statement since the present caretaker government took office on Jan 12. "Staying in office for more than 90 days has caused constitutional irregularities, but the government is not illegal or unconstitutional. These irregularities can be regularised when a parliament is formed," said Sircar, speaking at his official residence. According to the constitution, a non-party caretaker government is supposed to stay in office for only 90 days to hold the national election. But the present government has already crossed the six-month mark in office. Sircar said the present caretaker government could be justified by the "doctrine of necessity". "If no elected parliament is formed within 90 days, should the caretaker government go?" Sircar said. He said only a caretaker government could run the country after the expiry of an elected government as per the constitution. On the matter of BNP's chairmanship Sircar said, "As I am a neutral man, I cannot hold such a post." He ruled out the possibility of resigning from his office. Newspapers had earlier reported that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was going to quit her post and Sircar was going to replace her. bdne
