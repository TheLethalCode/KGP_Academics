<TITLE> Tapan rejects CPD comment on prices as nonsense </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury Sunday rubbished the Centre for Policy Dialogue's comment on oil, gas and power price hikes. Earlier in a press briefing Saturday, Debapriya Bhattacharya, executive director of the nongovernmental think-tank, said: "It would be an erratic decision to hike the prices of gas, power, fuel and fertiliser at a time when the prices of all essentials were increasing." Debapriya also said the plan for raising the prices of gas, power, fuel and fertiliser as "suggested by IMF" would be suicidal. Tapan said it is baseless and uncalled-for. Replying to a question, Tapan said: "No-one increases commodity prices whimsically. It is, in fact, quite difficult to inflate the prices of things. The government doesn't increase prices if avoidable." "Nobody gave in to donors. It is the nation's interest which is always taken care of first." Nullifying CPD's statement, he added: "Prices will not be increased under pressure from any quarter. All concerned, including economists, will be consulted before decisions about prices are hiked." bdnews24.com/ehb
