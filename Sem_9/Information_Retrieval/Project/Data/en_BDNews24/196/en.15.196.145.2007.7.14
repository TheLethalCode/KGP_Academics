 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Internet services remained disrupted for more than seven hours Saturday for "unknown reasons" in the network equipment of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. "We detected very low speed from the midday but BTTB could not solve it," the ISP Association's president MA Salam told bdnews24.com at 7pm. He said the state-owned telecoms monopoly neither revealed the cause of the trouble nor confirmed how long it would take to fix the problem. "As a result, the ISPs are unable to pacify angry customers." Salam also said the ISPs have migrated from satellite to the submarine cable expecting higher speed and reliability. "But such occurrences jeopardise our position in the market." BTTB has connected 620 megabits of internet bandwidth through its submarine cable network. Despite inaugurating the undersea cable more than a year ago, the government has not taken any initiative to set up a network monitoring facility, sources alleged. "We are desperately trying to recover the problem instead of searching its cause at this stage," said a high BTTB official, asking not to be quoted. He said BTTB has been operating the internet services with low-capacity network equipment called "router" since the submarine cable's commissioning last year. Such capacity of the router is generally used to manage a corporate network. "We are now installing a telecoms carrier-grade router and the situation will become much better soon." The official said BTTB engineers need training to manage such large-scale internet bandwidth. BTTB's chairman could not be contacted as he did not answer the mobile phone nor did he receive the home phone. bdn
