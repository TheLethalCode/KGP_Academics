<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Liberal Democratic Party president Badruddoza Chowdhury Thursday criticised the four-party alliance for their 'notorious' misdeeds when in power, while congratulating the present caretaker government for 'saving the country'. He made the comments at a meeting on political reforms with local LDP leaders in Rajshahi. He accused the four-party alliance of amassing wealth through corruption in the name of politics. "They wanted power in an unethical way. They led the nation to a deeper conflict. The present caretaker government rescued the country from that condition," Chowdhury said. He proposed reforms not only within political parties, but also within the Election Commission, parliament and voting system. LDP secretary general retired major Abdul Mannan said they were in discussions with grass-root level leaders about party reforms. "A final outline will be published according to their opinion," he added. bdnews24
