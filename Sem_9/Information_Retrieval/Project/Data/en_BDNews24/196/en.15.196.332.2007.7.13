 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's Javier Zanetti on Thursday remembered the bitterness of the Copa America final defeat to Brazil three years ago and said he was hoping for a happy ending this time. Brazil scored with the last kick of the game to draw 2-2 and then won on penalties in a memorable end to the 2004 tournament in Peru. The two old rivals meet again in the final on Sunday. "In that final we were left with a bitter taste because Argentina were good enough to have won the cup," he said. "Let's hope that this time we can have a happy ending." He added: "But we're not thinking of revenge. It's a classic match as always and we will try to win. There are no favourites." Zanetti, Argentina's second-most capped player with 110 appearances, was in the team in Peru three years ago but was surprisingly left out of the 2006 World Cup squad by Jose Pekerman. He is back in favour again under present coach Alfio Basile. Argentina have made a habit of failing to win tournaments in which they are considered to have played the best football. Their last major title was 14 years ago, when they won the Copa America in Ecuador. "We have great hopes at this moment," said Zanetti. "After all these years without winning an important title, we now have the opportunity. "Argentina have a chance to make history with this title.
