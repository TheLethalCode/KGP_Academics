<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan have little difference over reforms in the BNP, joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy said Friday. "Both the chairperson and the secretary general want reforms to take place and the party council will finalise the proposals. "There is no difference of opinions between the two about the process," Gayeshwar told reporters after a meeting at Bhuiyan's Gulshan home. "I personally endorse many of the secretary general's reform propositions. I have my own opinions, however, about some of them. "The chairperson too has her own opinions in some cases. I don't see any basic disagreement here," Gayeshwar said. "The leaders and workers of this major political party also want reforms as times and trends have changed. "I think the party's reform proposals, if aimed at getting rid of its follies and foibles, should benefit us all in the long run," continued Gayeshwar. He endorsed Bhuiyan's proposals on the parliament, Election Commission, Anticorruption Commission, Public Service Commission. The former state minister said the government must trust the political parties, discuss the issues of national interest with them. That is, he believed, was the only way for future parliaments to be able to pass bills on such issues based on national consensus. bdnew
