 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP has organised a three-day programme to observe the 29th death anniversary of party founder late president Ziaur Rahman. Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in a military coup in Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981. The central programme will start with a discussion meeting at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, in the capital on Saturday afternoon. Sunday's programmes include hoisting the national and party flags at half mast at BNP's Naya Paltan headquarters and paying tributes at Zia's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital. Party office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Saturday that the district-upazila-union BNP committees across the country had been given directions to observe Zia's death anniversary. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman, along with party leaders and activists will lay wreaths at Zia's grave at around 10am on Sunday. Other programmes include holding doa mahfils and blood donation for ailing people. The Dhaka metropolitan BNP will distribute food among the poor in all the wards of Dhaka City Corporation for three days starting from Sunday. Ziaur Rahman had declared war of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 27, 1971 from Chittagong's Kalurghat Radio Station. Zia, a sector commander during the liberation war, was later widely criticised for his military rule and for rehabilitating anti-liberation forces. He had taken over as the army chief after the assassination of former president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his family members by a group of renegade army officers on August 15, 1975. He later became deputy chief martial law administrator following a further coup on November 7 of the same year and took over as the chief martial law administrator on April 21, 1977. Zia took oath as the country's president on April 21, 1978. bdne
