 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)--The United States has congratulated Sheikh Hasina's government for arresting Saidur Rahman, chief of the banned Islamic outfit JMB. "We congratulate the government of Bangladesh on the arrest of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Saidur Rahman in Dhaka on Sunday evening," Robert O Blake, assistant secretary for bureau of south and central Asian affairs, said in a statement issued from Washington on May 28. He said that the JMB aimed to destroy the Bangladesh's democratic institution and its secular traditions. "The JMB has been responsible for numerous acts of indiscriminate violence against Bangladeshi civilians, including a coordinated series of bombings in August 2005 that affected 63 of the country's 64 districts, as well as attacks on judges, police and ordinary citizens," Blake said in the statement. The BNP government in 2006 arrested Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai following the JMB's country-wide bomb attacks on Aug 17, 2005. The JMB also carried out suicidal attacks on law enforcers and killed judges to destroy the country's legal system. "The United States looks forward to continued partnership with the government of Bangladesh to deny space to terrorists and to promote regional peace and security". The BNP government has banned the activities of the JMB. The police on Sunday arrested Saidur Rahman who took over charge of the JMB following the hanging of its top leaders including Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqul Islam Bangla Bhai during the tenure of the caretaker government
