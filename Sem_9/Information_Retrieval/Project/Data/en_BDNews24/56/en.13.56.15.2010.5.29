 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has stressed the importance of producing guidelines setting out criteria for the appointment of election commissioners. "If the Election Commission sends any proposal the government will examine it." Ahmed was speaking to reporters after inaugurating a two-day programme titled "Meeting on Cooperation of Election Commissions in the South Asia Region" being held in the capital's Radisson Hotel. The minister said only a strong commission can hold free and fair elections. "The government is extending cooperation to make the commission strong. We want honest and efficient people in the commission." Ahmed emphasised that there was a need for legislation on the appointment of election commissioners. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, who was present in the programme, said that the commission had formulated a draft of the law and would send it to the government. According to legal officers of the commission, neither the constitution nor any other legislation has set out qualification criteria for the appointment of chief election commissioner and other commissioners. Clauses 48(3) and 118 of the constitution, when read together, simply give the president the power to appoint commissioners following the prime minister's advice. Any individual can be appointed since there is no particular qualification requirements set down In his speech, the law minister also hailed the move to form a forum among the election commissions of the SAARC region. He said meetings among the election commissions of the south Asia region will help the related officials to hold free, fair and acceptable elections. Commissioners and secretaries of the Election Commissions of the eight SAARC members of the host country Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan, the Maldives and Afghanistan except Sri Lanka have participated in the programme. As Sri Lanka has no chief election commissioner at present no representative has come from the country. Representatives of election commission of South Africa also joined the programme. Election Commission secretary Humayun Kabir said the programme hoped to establish a forum so that information, strategies and experience can be shared among the commissions of the SAARC countries. bdne
