 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Food minister Abdur Razzak launched a 'fair-price rice' programme run by textile businessmen on Thursday to around 650,000 workers in the readymade garments sector. "The programme will initially require 13,026 tonnes of rice a month, and more workers will be included in the programme in the future," said Razzak at the launch of the programme at Sathi Fashion Apparels in Mirpur. Under the programme, garment workers will have access to 20 kilograms of rice a month at the subsidised rate of Tk 16 per kilogram for a period of a year. Dealers employed by the factories will be permitted to purchase subsidised rice at Tk 14 a kilogram from government warehouses, where the government originally paid Tk 22 a kilogram. Over 540,000 employees of 618 factories under the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association will be included in the programme, while over 100,000 workers at 140 factories under the umbrella of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturer and Exporters Association will also be included. "Garment employees work hard for low wages, but play a vital role in building foreign reserves. The aim of the programme is to help these hard working citizens," said Razzak. Managing director of Sathi Fashion Abul Kalam Azad, food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman and BKMEA president Fazlul Haq also attended the event. b
