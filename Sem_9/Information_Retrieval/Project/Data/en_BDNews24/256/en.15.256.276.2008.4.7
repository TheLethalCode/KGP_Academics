 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com) - Left-arm spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo and Mehrab Hossain Junior shared seven wickets as the GP-BCB academy team handed an innings and 68-run defeat to the South Africa academy team in the first four-dayer Monday. Pacer Nazmul Hossain, who claimed four wickets in the first innings, made inroads into the visitors batting lineup while Shuvo and Mehrab wiped up the middle and late orders at Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore. Trailing by 196 runs in the first innings, South Africa folded at 128 all out in 37.3 overs in the second innings with Shuvo grabbing four for 36 and Mehrab three for 40. South Africa were 39 for five at one stage in the face of superb bowling from the hosts, and middle orders B Barnes and Das Navies (21) tried to repair the damage with 61 runs for the sixth wicket before the latter was Mehrab's second victim, triggering a quick collapse in tail. N Wagner (12) was run out by Nazmul, leaving the side at 119 for seven while Shuvo claimed his fourth scalp trapping M Mahlombe (0) to reduce the visitors to 121 for eight. South African resistance came to an end when their highest scorer B Barnes was run out by Dollar Mahmdu for 54 while Mehrab wrapped the Proteas innings uprooting the Aziz Temoor (0) stumps to give the hosts a wild celebration despite the first day of the match washed out due to rains. Earlier, GP-BCB academy team, having resumed the final day on 319 for four, added another 188 runs to declare their first innings at 507 for eight, taking 196- run lead. Nayeem Islam converted his overnight 96 to 136 off 289 balls hitting 19 fours and two sixes while the remarkable contributions from tail-ender Shamsur Rahman (41), Mushfiqur Rahim (53 not out), Shuvo (26) and Dollar (23) allowed the host to go beyond the 500-mark. Aziz Temoor raised his tally to three for 92 while Van Schalkwyk chipped in with two wickets each for 70 and 81 respectively.
