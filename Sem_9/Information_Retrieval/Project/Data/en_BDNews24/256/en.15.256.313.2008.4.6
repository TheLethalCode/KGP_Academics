<TITLE> Zimbabweans grow impatient in poll stalemate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's March 29 election raised high hopes. Perhaps food and fuel shortages would ease one day. Or dissent would no longer be risky. But more than a week later, Zimbabweans are still waiting anxiously for the full results of the poll, and wondering if the delay spells more misery ahead. Critics say there are growing signs that veteran President Robert Mugabe, who has presided over an economic meltdown, has no intention of stepping down -- whatever the result. "We have been hearing all kinds of stories about the police and soldiers being sent to some areas and it's worrying," said Chamunorwa Matanga, a black market currency dealer who works out of his car, taking advantage of a demand for hard currency, with Zimbabwe's dollar hitting freefall. Mugabe suffered his first election defeat in almost three decades when his ZANU-PF party lost control of parliament in the March election. But there have been no results for the presidential race, which opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says he has won outright. The ZANU-PF is trying to overturn Mugabe's biggest setback of his 28-year rule by challenging both the parliamentary and presidential poll while mobilising its militia forces. State media said on Sunday the party has asked the electoral commission to delay announcing the outcome pending a recount. The MDC said a recount would be illegal and the government was planning violence to stay in power. Tsvangirai has promised to ease an economic meltdown marked by the world's highest inflation rate officially put at over 100,000 percent, fuel shortages and 80-percent unemployment. He has not spelled out how he would ease the suffering of Zimbabweans, who have known only one leader since Mugabe took power in 1980 at independence from Britain. But he has won the confidence of many Zimbabweans who believe he can improve Zimbabwe's image and win back foreign investors to rescue the economy. "I really think that if the MDC can be the government, things will change in a very short time," said marketing student Sarudzai Chidzonga, 20. "There is a lot of support from the people and I think they will also attract a lot of investors." Others have lost patience in the political stalemate. "There are so many rumours but no explanations. Right now since elections started business is at a standstill and you can't do anything," Giles Mbeya, 56, who runs a small chemical manufacturing business, said at a petrol station queue -- a common sight in a country hit by constant commodity shortages. For now, all Zimbabweans can do is wonder if their votes will count, and whether the election can make a difference in this once-prosperous country. "Look at this, there are pot-holes everywhere and burst pipes...sewerage is just smelling," said Edzai Ndemera.
