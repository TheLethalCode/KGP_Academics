 LONDON, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks hit a fresh one-month high and the dollar rose on Monday, bolstered by firmer commodity prices and growing expectations that banks are close to cleaning up their credit-related troubles. Optimism also stemmed from speculation that finance chiefs from the Group of Seven rich nations, meeting in Washington this weekend, are considering drastic steps to fix banks and markets battered by the US mortgage meltdown. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said it expected much higher bad debt provisions in the first half of fiscal 2008, becoming the latest bank to reveal damage from the credit crunch. ANZ shares fell sharply, but banking stocks in Europe climbed as efforts by financial firms to come clean, and a possible joint plan by governments to help them, bolstered sentiment. "Any signal from the authorities to boost market confidence ... or try and boost liquidity I would associate with dollar-positive and risk-taking trades," said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC in London. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 percent on the day while MSCI main world equity index was up a quarter percent, hitting its highest since late February. European banking stocks rose almost 0.8 percent, while mining shares were up on firmer metal prices. The dollar was up half a percent against a basket of major currencies and around 0.6 percent higher at $1.5630 per euro. The June Bund future was down 30 ticks, pressured by firmer stocks. European credit market sentiment also improved. The iTraxx Crossover index, the most-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, tightened 20 basis points to 463 bps. US light crude was up 0.3 percent at $106.56 a barrel after OPEC's secretary general suggested the group saw little need to pump more oil. Gold tracked oil higher, jumping to $915.25 an ounce -- still below record highs of $1,030.80 hit in March. Firmer commodity prices also helped emerging market assets. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 6 bps while emerging stocks rose 1 percent
