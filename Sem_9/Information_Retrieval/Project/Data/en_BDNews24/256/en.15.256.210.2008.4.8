 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)  Former law minister Moudud Ahmed Tuesday appeared before a Dhaka court in a case that charges him with importing liquor bottles dodging duty and illegally possessing them. He appeared before the Dhaka Metropolitan Second Additional Sessions Judge's Court at 11:30am. Tuesday was fixed for submission of High Court stay order on the proceedings of the case. But Moudud's lawyers sought time for submitting the order. Judge KM Rasheduzzaman Raja set April 13 for submission of the stay order. Joint forces on April 13 last year recovered 32 cans of beer and 16 bottles of foreign liquor from Moudud's Gulshan home. Sub-inspector Kabir Hossain of Gulshan Police Station filed the case and officer-in-charge Obaidul Haque on completion of investigation under the Special Powers Act and Emergency Powers Rules on May 15 that year filed charge sheet in the court. Charges were framed against Moudud on June 18 last year. His lawyers filed an appeal the following day with the High Court to quash the case. On Nov 1, justices Md Abdul Quddus and Ashfaqul Islam extended the tenure of the stay order by another six months. bdne
