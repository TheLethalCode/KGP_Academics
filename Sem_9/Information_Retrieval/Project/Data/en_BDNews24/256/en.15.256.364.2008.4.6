 Taipei, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's vice president-elect may meet Chinese leader Hu Jintao at a trade fair in China this week, local media said on Sunday, an unprecedented step that would underline the chances for a thaw after years of diplomatic chill. The trip comes soon after a landslide victory by President-elect Ma Ying-jeou and running mate Vincent Siew in elections last month on a platform to repair strained ties with China, which considers the self-ruled island its own. Siew, who heads the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, will be leading a Taiwan delegation to the annual Boao Forum For Asia in China's southern island province of Hainan. "Mr. Siew should be able to go. China hasn't said no and that's why we've decided to announce to everybody that we'll be going to the forum on April 11 and returning on April 13," Yu-chi Wang, spokesman for the delegation told Reuters by telephone. Wang said it was not confirmed whether there would be a meeting between Siew and Hu, though local media, including Taiwan's TVBS television station and the United Daily News, said the two might meet since Hu would be attending the event this year. The Taiwan Affairs Office was unavailable for comment. Official talks between China and Taiwan have been suspended since 1999, when Taiwan's former president, Lee Teng-hui, redefined ties as "special state-to-state" relations. But with the election of the more China-friendly Ma, some analysts believe more than half a century of hostility and tension between China and Taiwan might finally come to an end. Siew, an ex-premier who has also held top economics posts in Taiwan, has been attending the annual forum in China over the past few years. China sees Taiwan as a wayward province and wants to bring the island under its fold, by force if necessary. Despite political differences, trade ties have flourished and China has since become Taiwan's top trading partner and favourite investment destination.
