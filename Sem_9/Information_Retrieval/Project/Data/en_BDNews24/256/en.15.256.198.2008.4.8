 Singapore, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks with North Korea's top nuclear envoy on Tuesday have made progress towards resuming stalled negotiations over the North's nuclear programme, US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said. "Depending on what we hear back from capitals by tomorrow, I think there will be some further announcements very soon," Hill told reporters after meeting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan in Singapore. "We did as much as we could do ... We addressed all the issues we needed to address," Hill said. South Korean media earlier quoted Kim as saying: "There was a considerable narrowing of differences in view" at the meeting. South Korea's Yonhap news agency also quoted Kim as saying the discussions were "serious". When asked if a deal was near on the declaration, he said: "There were discussions on the overall issues. Try to look at this with more time and patience." Six-nation talks have been held up pending a full accounting of North Korea's nuclear activities, a declaration that was due at the end of last year. "We need to get things finalised for phase two. If we can do that I think we would look forward to having (North Korea) make their report ... and i think the Chinese would want to call a six-party meeting as soon as it can be arranged," Hill said. China chairs the six-party talks. Hill had told reporters before his meeting with Kim that he was not expecting to reach an agreement on a declaration at this meeting. "I don't think we will have any agreement. We are not looking for an agreement. We are looking to have a consultation on some of the issues that have kept us apart. They know exactly what the issues are and that we don't want to meet them unless we could achieve something." HEIGHTENED TENSION The meeting in Singapore came at a time of heightened tension on the heavily armed Korean peninsula in recent days after North Korea tested short-range missiles and made threats against South Korea. Washington wants Pyongyang to give a complete accounting of its nuclear programmes as called for in a landmark deal struck in the six-party talks among China, Japan, Russia, the two Koreas and the United States in February 2007. The declaration is meant to answer U.S. suspicions of a secret programme to enrich uranium for weapons and proliferating nuclear technology. North Korea has said it had already made the declaration and the U.S. suspicions were "fictions". Gavan McCormack, an East Asia expert at Australian National University, said the nuclear declaration was a hurdle that must be crossed in order for the six-party talks to regain momentum. Diplomatic sources in Tokyo told Reuters the United States and North Korea have been discussing a possible face-saving compromise under which Pyongyang would acknowledge the US assertions in a document separate from its declaration. "The proposal is face-saving to bot sides," one source said. "It is particularly face-saving to North Korea because they don't have to directly admit that they had done something wrong." Last month, a senior US official said Washington had begun exploring whether Pyongyang might disclose any proliferation and uranium enrichment in a separate document. If the North makes a declaration that satisfies Washington, it stands to be removed from a US terrorism blacklist and be better able to tap into finance that could boost its economy. Hill, who last met Kim about a month ago in Geneva, will fly to Beijing early on Wednesday to meet South Korean, Japanese and Russian officials to brief them on the North Korean situation. "I think we took the process beyond where we were in Geneva, and we both agreed that we will report back to our capitals and await further instructions," Hill sa
