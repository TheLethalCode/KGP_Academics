<TITLE> Slogans and hunger strikes will not free Hasina: AL's Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com) Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Sunday urged party leaders and workers to get more organised to have Sheikh Hasina released. "The leader will not be released by sitting in the Awami League office chanting slogans and holding hunger strikes," he said. Ashraful was speaking as Awami League front organisation Bangladesh Krishak League ended a daylong hunger strike at the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue to press home its demand for the release of detained AL president Sheikh Hasina. AL acting president Zillur Rahman, bringing the hunger strike to a close at 5 pm, alleged that the present caretaker government was dilly-dallying with the release of Hasina to prolong its term in power. "One can not cling to power resorting to repression and torture. To stay in power one has to love people." Zillur also claimed if Hasina was not sent abroad for proper treatment "people will not tolerate it in silence". Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said the party was undertaking all types of efforts, including discussions with diplomats and the government, to get their party chief released. "If Sheikh Hasina was in power such a famine-like situation would not have arisen in the country and people would get to eat," Amu alleged. Former agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury said Sheikh Hasina was being kept in jail "so that she cannot lead us". "But whatever is done Sheikh Hasina will remain in power. There will be no benefit in setting up a factory for producing new leadership." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed had earlier formally declared Krishak League's hunger strike on at 10 am. Tofail, in a brief speech delivered on the occasion, asked the government: "Release Sheikh Hasina immediately and arrange her proper medical treatment." "We are not the government's antagonists, rather we'd like to cooperate with the administration," he said, urging the government to take heed. He also called upon the caretaker government to ensure elections according to the declared roadmap, lift the state of emergency and allow indoor politics immediately. AL organising secretary MA Mannan Sheikh demanded the release of Sheikh Hasina and said one kilogramme of rice during the AL regime cost only Tk 10, which has soared to Tk 45 in 2008. "Hungry people will not abide by the emergency rule and will eventually come out on the streets," he warned. He called upon the caretaker government to "control consumer prices and leave politics alone". bdnews24.com/
