 NEW DELHI, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has questioned the commitment of some players in the India squad following the side's crushing second test defeat to South Africa in Ahmedabad. The hosts were skittled out for 76 on the first morning and went on to lose by an innings and 90 runs, leaving Gavaskar to suggest some players were distracted by the build-up to the Twenty20 Indian Premier League (IPL) beginning on April 18.

Gavaskar urged new coach Gary Kirsten, who took over before the series, to tighten discipline. "Kirsten better crack the whip, or else some of the guys will ride roughshod over him. "A player like Sehwag, who got 319, being given a day off from practice is fine or, for that matter, a bowler who has bowled a lot, but those guys who hardly got a wicket and looked unlikely to get one, opting not to practice doesn't speak highly of their commitment. "They should have been going hard at the nets, trying to get their wrist position and footwork right rather than practicing their dancing steps. "It is about time they realised that they are what they are, because of cricket." The third and final test starts in Kanpur on Frida
