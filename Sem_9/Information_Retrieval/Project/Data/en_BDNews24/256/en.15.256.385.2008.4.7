 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)  The 44th Convocation of Dhaka University was held Monday amid extensive security measures as student and teacher groups voiced disapproval and protest at president Iajuddin Ahmed's scheduled participation in the ceremony. The convocation began at 10:00 am with a colourful procession, led by Iajuddin in his role as university chancellor, from the Curzon Hall premises to the convocation venue at the university's central sports ground. Dhaka University conferred honorary Doctor of Laws degrees on Language Movement veterans ANM Gaziul Haque and Abdul Matin this year, for their roles in the Bangla-language struggle of 1952, marking the first time the university has awarded any honorary degree to a language veteran. In his address to the convocation, the president emphasised the importance of English in higher education, alongside the mother language. Iajuddin also stressed the need for universities to support a knowledge-based society and nurture "knowledge-oriented individuals  who can expand their views outside the country too" in the present age of globalisation. "Like many others I also personally want that our mother language has its place in academic activities of the universities. At the same time considering globalisation and internationalism English has to be given emphasis in the arena of higher education." Extensive security measures were put in place in and around the campus Monday, as BNP student wing Jatyatabadi Chhatra Dal boycotted the convocation, while Awami League's student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League held a silent procession in protest at the president's participation. Over 100 Bangladesh Chhatra League members took part in the procession from Modhu's Canteen on the campus to the Aparajeo Bangla monument, where the protestors declared Iajuddin Ahmed 'persona non grata' on the DU campus. Sohel Rana Tipu, president of the university's BCL wing, said: "The role of professor Iajuddin during national crises have been demeaning. His role in handling the August 2007 student unrest was thoroughly unbecoming of a teacher." Left-leaning teachers and Awami League sympathisers among the DU faculty had also voiced disapproval of Iajuddin's presence at the convocation. Addressing those who received degrees Monday, president Iajuddin said: "Getting a certificate just in order to get a job should not be the ultimate aim of education." "The significance of this achievement is far reaching. I hope all will remain active and alert in discharging their responsibilities in their respective fields." No university becomes famous for its chancellors or other officials, Iajuddin said: "The success and reputation of a university depends on the success of the teachers and students." "The works and research by its teachers expand the reputation of the university. The depth of knowledge of the students testifies to the quality of the university." He said at present the main task of universities was to nurture a knowledge-oriented individual. Mentioning the glorious history of Dhaka University, the president said: "I hope the contribution of Dhaka University in the forward march of the nation will be even brighter in the future." The deans of the various faculties awarded degrees to 3,885 graduates and post-graduates at this year's convocation. Of these 2,042 were women and 1,843 men. Twenty-four received M Phil degrees, 29 PhD degrees and 52 students were given gold medals for outstanding results. Matin, who gave the day's convocation speech, said on receiving his honorary degree: "I consider the honour an acknowledgement of the language movement rather than the acknowledgement of any personal role." "It is very unfortunate that our mother tongue is yet to be established in every sphere," he said suggesting a commission of university teachers, linguists, politicians, intellectuals and journalists be formed for the purpose. "Dhaka University should spearhead the mission." "Steps should also be taken for the younger generation so that they can learn other important languages, including English," the language movement veteran said, acknowledging the importance of English in this day and age. Acting DU registrar Rezaur Rahman, who conducted the main ceremony on Monday, read out the written speech of language veteran ANM Gaziul Haque, who was not present due to illness. "The university through conferring the honorary doctorate degree pays respect not only to us, it also pays tribute to numerous students and protesters of the language movement. I am overwhelmed," Haque wrote. Vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz, and pro-vice chancellor Prof AFM Yusuf Haider also spoke on the occasion. bdnews24.com/mu
