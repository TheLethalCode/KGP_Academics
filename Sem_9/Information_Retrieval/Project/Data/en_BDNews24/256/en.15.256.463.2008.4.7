 PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ramnaresh Sarwan's match-winning century in West Indies's series-saving win over Sri Lanka on Sunday confirmed his return to top form and the player said he hopes he is now heading into his peak. Sarwan produced a masterful display of concentration and footwork during a lengthy session against Muttiah Muralitharan and after passing 50 in his three previous innings in the series, completed his first hundred in nearly two years. "I've been getting off to good starts in this series, I wanted to do the same, pick the bad balls and fortunately I was able to do that and go on and get the hundred," Sarwan told reporters after the six-wicket win. West Indies were in trouble at 73 for three when Shivnarine Chanderpaul joined Sarwan and they put on a decisive partnership of 157 to ensure their side tied the series at 1-1. "After we lost Marlon (Samuels) I knew I had to form a good partnership with Shiv. The good thing was that Shiv was flowing and I didn't have to do all the scoring, he was positive and that paid off for us," said Sarwan. The 27-year-old Sarwan returned to the side this series after missing nearly 10 months through various injuries, which kept him out of games against England, Zimbabwe and South Africa. West Indies skipper Chris Gayle said there was no doubt his side, who lost series in England and South Africa, sorely felt Sarwan's absence. "Missing Sarwan really hurt us and it is good to have him back out there. He showed how important he is at number three," said Gayle. "It is good to have him back, he looked the part and I have to give him credit. I hope he can build on this and capitalise on his good starts and get those hundreds -- big hundreds." Although he did not enjoy his time on the sidelines Sarwan said he had put it to good use and was no confident more hundreds - and his best years are ahead of him. "When I couldn't play I realised how much I was missing the game and ...it gave me time to think about what I need to do. "I've been out for 10 months, players tend to mature around 26-27 and then it carries on till they are 33-34 and I hope that is going to be the case for me. I've certainly gained a lot of experience and I think I can use that
