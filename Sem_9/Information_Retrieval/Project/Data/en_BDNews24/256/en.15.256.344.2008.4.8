 Hong Kong, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks fell 1.09 percent on Tuesday, tracking losses in regional markets, with financial shares such as HSBC Holdings leading the drop as investors locked in profits a day after the index hit a five-week closing high. Asia's top oil refiner Sinopec Corp also weighed, dropping 4.3 percent to HK$7.29 after global crude prices jumped $3 per barrel, further squeezing its margins as domestic fuel prices are capped by the government. The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended down 267.07 points at 24,311.69. It has fallen 24 percent since it hit an all-time high in October. The China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed mainland firms, or H shares, fell 1.67 percent to 13,196.22. Mainboard turnover fell to HK$87.74 billion ($11.2 billion), from HK$99.47 billion on Monday. "Basically the market has been over-bought, so there is some profit-taking pressure," said Ben Kwong, associate director of KGI Asia Ltd. "The regional markets also had some setbacks today and the momentum of a rebound in mainland Chinese markets seems to be weaker than expected, providing an excuse for some short-term correction." He expects the short-term support level to be 24,100. bdnews24.com/lq/1551hrs "If this support level is broken, the index may have to move back to the 23,800 level." Heavyweight stocks weighed, with China Mobile falling 2.02 percent to HK$125.80 and HSBC down 0.53 percent at HK$131.10. Chinese banking play ICBC dropped 0.68 percent to HK$5.86, while China Construction Bank fell 1.69 percent to HK$6.40. But Zijin Mining bucked the broad market trend, leaping 12 percent before closing up 7.5 percent at HK$8.60 after China's No. 2 gold producer kicked off a sale of domestic stock that could raise $1.4 billion to bankroll expansion. Another bright spot was Singamas Container Holdings Ltd, which surged 8.9 percent to HK$2.33 after the world's No. 2 shipping container maker more than doubled its second-half earnings on record output and higher box prices. COSCO Pacific ended down 6.3 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded the port and shipping container leasing firm to hold from buy, saying sustained weakness in the company's leasing business was alarming. Similarly, Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co Ltd fell 3.4 percent after it said it would suffer a loss in the first quarter of 2008. Jilin Qifeng Chemical Fiber Co Ltd tumbled as much as 16 percent before closing down 6.8 percent after it said it expected to see a significant decline or may even record a net loss for 2007 due to rising raw materials costs and stagnant demand for acryl
