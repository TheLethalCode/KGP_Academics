Arsenal, who must score to have a chance of advancing, have netted only once away in three Champions League quarter-finals - at Chelsea in 2004. They lost 1-0 to Valencia in 2001 and drew 0-0 with Juventus in 2006. Playing on Wednesday (1945) MANCHESTER UNITED V AS ROMA Head-to-head record Played: 5 Wins: Manchester United 3, AS Roma 1, Draws 1 Goals: Manchester United 12, AS Roma 4 Previous games CL: QF 3.04.07 AS Roma 2 Manchester United 1 10.04.07 Manchester United 7 AS Roma 1 CL: GP 2.10.07 Manchester United 1 AS Roma 0 12.12.07 AS Roma 1 Manchester United 1 CL: QF 1.04.08 AS Roma 0 Manchester United 2 Previous appearances in last four: Champions League - Manchester United 4, AS Roma 0 European Cup - Manchester United 9, AS Roma 1 All European competitions - Manchester United 12, AS Roma 5 Leading Champions League 07-08 scorers: Manchester United - Cristiano Ronaldo 7 AS Roma - Mirko Vucinic 4 Manchester United, meeting AS Roma for the sixth time in the Champions League in just over a year, have won their last 10 Champions League home games and are unbeaten in 14.

Roma have won just once on 13 previous away games in England, a 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the UEFA Cup seven seasons ago. In their 13 trips to England, Roma have scored a total of just seven goals. The only time they scored twice was on their first visit in the Fairs Cup final when they drew 2-2 with Birmingham City in 1961. Roma's chances look close to nil. Manchester United have lost seven of 67 Champions League home games but none by the minimum two-goal margin that Roma need to reach the semi-finals.
