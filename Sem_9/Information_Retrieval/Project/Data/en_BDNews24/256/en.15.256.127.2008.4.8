 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh conceded a massive 152-run defeat to hosts Pakistan in the five-ODI series opener Tuesday at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Bangladesh folded at 129 all out in 29.5 overs, chasing a revised target of 282 in 39 overs following the floodlight failure twice. The target was first revised to 299 in 43 overs for Bangladesh after lights went off after the 12th over with the scoreboard reading 53 for three. The play resumed but power went off again after one over bowled, and the target was then revised down to 282 in 39 overs. Earlier, Mohammad Yousuf struck a finely-paced century to power Pakistan to 322 for five in 50 overs. It was an old easy of batting failure for Bangladesh as the batsmen threw their wickets away with Mashrafee Bin Mortaza scoring the highest 25 off 20 balls. Left-arm pacer Sohail Tanvir (3/29) rattled the top order removing Tamim Iqbal (5), Shahriar Nafees (24) and Aftab Ahmed (15) while medium pacer Iftikhar Anjum (2/16) wiped middle orders Mohammad Ashraful (9) and Shakib Al Hasan (0) in the same over. Left-arm spinner Shahid Afridi (3/41) cleaned up the tail removing Farhad Reza (7), Dhiman Ghosh (0) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Earlier, Yousuf began slowly but pressed on the gas to complete his 15th one-day century and set a new fourth-wicket partnership record with Shoaib Malik against Bangladesh by putting on 145 off just 127 balls. They eclipsed the previous best of an unbroken stand of 112 runs set by Inzamam-ul-Haq and Younis Khan in Multan in 2003. The 33-year old middle-order batsman swept Abdur Razzak for a single to reach his ton and remained unconquered on 108 off 103 balls while Malik scored 85 off 75 balls, his 27th ODI fifty. Bangladesh kept the hosts in check to reduce them to 70 for three in 17.3 overs, thanks to some tight bowling from medium pacer Farhad Reza and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Malik, who chose to bat first in the day-night match, and Yousuf, however, concentrated on singles to keep Bangladeshi spinners at bay and build momentum. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful changed the bowlers in desperation to break the stand but saw his ordinary bowling line-up far from enough to make an impact on the experienced, determined Pakistanis. Left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan finally broke the fourth-wicket stand, but by then the duo took their side beyond the 200-mark with nearly 5.5 runs per over. Later, two cameos from Mishbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi helped Pakistan put up a huge total. Mishbah smashed 38 off 27 balls with the help of two sixes and one four while Afridi cracked a 11-ball 27 not out that was studded with two sixes and as many fours. Farhad and Mashrafee returned two wickets each for 41 and 52 while Shakib took one for 52 in their 10-over spells. Ashraful and Mahmudullah were most expensive bowlers to concede 26 and 59 runs in two and five overs respectively. Bangladesh picked the same eleven that had played against Ireland in the last match of the three-ODI series at home. Bangladesh: Shahriar Nafees, Tamim Iqbal, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan, Farhad Reza, Raqibul Hasan, Mahmudullah, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Dhiman Ghosh and Abdur Razzak. Pakistan: Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Shoaib Malik, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul and Iftikhar Anjum bdnews
