 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday, relinquishing this week's one-month peaks after negative US company earnings news, while sterling hit an 11-year low after a weak UK housing survey fuelled concerns about the economy. Aluminium producer Alcoa Inc said late on Monday its first-quarter profit halved from a year ago due to energy costs and the weak dollar, while US computer processor maker Advanced Micro Devices said it would cut 10 percent of its workforce after Q1 sales fell more than expected. A survey by UK mortgage lender Halifax on Tuesday showed British house prices fell 2.5 percent in March, much more than expected and the biggest monthly drop since September 1992. As a result of these factors, investors shifted their focus back to economic fundamentals after pushing world stocks up every day since the new quarter began on expectations that governments might help banks clean up credit-related problems. "It's still looking very jittery at the moment. We've had the banking problems wane away a little bit but there's still uncertainty surrounding the sector... now that the dust has settled and the rally's over," said James Hughes, market analyst at CMC Markets. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.1 percent, while MSCI main world equity index fell 0.6 percent. The MSCI index hit its highest since late February on Monday, extending last week's gains, after losing nearly 10 percent in the first quarter. US stock futures were down around 0.4 percent, indicating a weaker open on Wall Street later. Expectations that Group of Seven finance chiefs who meet in Washington this weekend might unveil a drastic plan to fix banks and markets had improved sentiment since last week. Money market tensions eased further, especially in sterling funds after the Bank of England said it would provide three-month funds next week and consider other options to ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. FOCUS BACK ON FUNDAMENTALS Sterling was the biggest loser among major currencies, hitting its weakest since 1996 on a trade-weighted basis and losing 1 percent to hit a 1-1/2 month low of $1.9683. The Halifax survey offered the latest evidence that the credit crunch was feeding through to households and cemented expectations the Bank of England would cut interest rates this week. Also souring the general mood, New Zealand business confidence slumped to a 33-year low in the first quarter while Australian business conditions deteriorated to levels last seen in December 2002. "Market focus may slowly shift from the financial crisis to the fall-out effects on the world's real economies," said Stephen Jen, head of FX strategy at Morgan Stanley, in a note. "The global economy's real business cycle has just begun to migrate south, starting with more concrete evidence of a US recession." The dollar was steady against a basket of major currencies. Emerging sovereign spreads widened 4 basis points while emerging stocks were down 0.8 percent. The June Bund future was up 12 ticks, suggesting renewed interest in safe-haven government debt. Oil prices had risen above $109 before coming off after Iran said it had started to set up advanced centrifuges at a uranium enrichment facility and on fears over diesel supply disruptions following a European refinery fi
