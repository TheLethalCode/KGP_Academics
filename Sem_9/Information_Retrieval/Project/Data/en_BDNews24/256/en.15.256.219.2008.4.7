<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi won a formal public apology from the Daily Star in the High Court on Monday over its claim that he had racially abused France's Zinedine Zidane in 2006. The British newspaper claimed Materazzi had racially abused Zidane during the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin when the Frenchman head-butted the Italian and was sent off. Italy won the final on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time in which Materazzi scored their equaliser. He also netted a penalty in the shootout. Materazzi, who plays for Italian champions Inter Milan, sued the Star's publishers Express Newspapers over a series of articles and will receive "substantial damages and his legal costs" from the paper, his lawyer Steven Heffer said. At a news conference following the hearing, Materazzi said through an interpreter that he was relieved the case had been settled, although cases are still proceeding against two other newspapers. "It has been a very distressing time for my family and as a father I had to explain what was going on to my children," said the 34-year-old. "There had to be new measures in taking them to school, and I explained that people just got things wrong. But I am very relieved and happy that this case is now over." In his autobiography, published last year, Materazzi admitted he had made an insulting remark about Zidane's sister. Asked at the news conference if he had made similar comments to other opponents since then, he replied: "No, I haven't done that. I don't want to risk my life." QUITE WRONG Materazzi's counsel Jane Phillips told the hearing: "In (post-match) articles the defendant (Daily Star) stated, quite wrongly, that the claimant (Materazzi) had used vile racist abuse during the World Cup final, including calling the mother of his opponent, Zinedine Zidane, a 'terrorist whore', thus goading Zidane into losing his temper and causing Zidane to head-butt the claimant. "The defendant accepts these allegations are wholly untrue and that there is no question of the claimant having said anything of a racist nature to Zidane whatsoever..." Kate Wilson, for Express Newspapers, said: "The defendant would like to take this opportunity to apologise to the claimant for any distress and embarrassment which he has suffered as a result of the publication of these articles." Materazzi, present in court to hear the apology, said in a statement: "I really appreciate the apology published in the Daily Star. The truth is now coming out - finally. I am looking forward to a quick and positive conclusion to my claims against the other newspapers who published lies about me. Only then will I be truly satisfied.
