<TITLE> What power would Russia's Putin have as party boss? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Russia's biggest party said on Monday he would invite Vladimir Putin to take over as party leader when he steps down as president next month after eight years in the job. Putin has already said he will serve as prime minister under Russia's next president, his protege Dmitry Medvedev, but leading the United Russia party would give him additional influence. He would effectively control the lower house of parliament, where United Russia has 315 of the 450 seats. Here are the main powers the lower house, or State Duma, exercises under the constitution: The Duma can change the constitution if no fewer than two-thirds of the lawmakers vote in favour of the amendment. The president has to seek the Duma's approval for his choice of prime minister. If it rejects his nominee three times, the president can dissolve the parliament and call a new election. The chamber can vote no-confidence in the government. The president can refuse to sack the government, but if the Duma repeats its vote of no-confidence a second time within three months, he must either dismiss the government or dissolve parliament. The Duma can initiate impeachment proceedings against the president, if a two-thirds majority votes in favour. The upper house of parliament and the Supreme Court then decide if there are grounds to remove the president from his post. The Duma can approve or reject the president's nominee for chairman of the central bank. The president also needs the Duma's approval to sack the central bank chief. New legislation must be approved by the Duma before it can become law. The chamber also approves the budget. The president, though, has the power to veto laws. United Russia also controls most regional legislatures. They have the power to reject the president's nominee for regional governor.
