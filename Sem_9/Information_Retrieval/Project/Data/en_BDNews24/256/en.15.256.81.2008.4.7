 Baikonur, Kazakhstan, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As a child, Yi So-yeon dreamed of rising to the heights of political power. It didn't cross her mind that she would one day become the first South Korean citizen in space. Speaking a day before her scheduled blast-off into orbit aboard the Soviet-made Soyuz TMA-12 spacecraft, Yi said she was fully ready for the adventure.

Yi will fly on an 11-day mission to replenish supplies at the ISS and swap permanent crews. One of her fellow space travellers, Volkov, is the son of Alexander Volkov, who was on the Mir space station in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. Yi said watching films about men and women conducting scientific experiments in space played a role in her decision to become an astronaut. "Right now, at the ISS, inside the Soyuz and right here, I am not a woman, I'm just a cosmonaut," she said. She plans to take a bit of Korean culture into outer space by serving the traditional kimchi spicy cabbage and singing a song at a dinner party on April 12. She said the choice of her song was a secr
