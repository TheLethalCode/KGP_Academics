<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia has urged the government to send sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for better medical treatment, a lawyer said Monday. Updated In a rare gesture, Khaleda has also expressed concern over the illness of detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and prayed for her recovery, the BNP chairperson's lawyer advocate Ahmed Azam Khan told reporters. Khan had earlier met Khaleda in special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex Monday afternoon and discussed different cases against her. He stayed there for one hour from 2.30pm. Besides urging the government to send Tarique to Germany and Coco to Singapore for treatment, Khaleda, according to the lawyer, expressed concern over "the way Tarique is being treated here putting his life at risk". Khaleda was quoted to have prayed for Hasina, her once-political rival: "I pray to Allah for her quick recovery. At the same time I would say that I have support to the demand by her husband and lawyers for her better treatment." Khaleda said charges against Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and his mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu in the case were baseless, according to the lawyer. The BNP chairperson arrested in 2007 for her alleged involvement in corruption as prime minister was quoted to have described the price spiral of food as a "near-famine situation". "I don't know how the people would overcome this crisis. However, I pray and hope the people will face it." Khan said: "The condition of Khaleda Zia is not well. She is suffering from leg pain." Later, two other lawyers barrister Nasiruddin Ashim and Kaiser Kamal met Khaleda in special jail to discuss the cases against her. bdnew
