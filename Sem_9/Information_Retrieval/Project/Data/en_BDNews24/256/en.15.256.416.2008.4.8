<TITLE> Severn Trent to be fined for falsifying data </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's second-biggest water company, Severn Trent, will be hit by a record 36 million pounds fine from water regulator Ofwat for lying about its performance, allowing it to overcharge customers, Ofwat said on Tuesday. Severn Trent, which supplies water and waste services to around 8 million people, faces a separate court fine for falsifying information about water leakage, following a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Birmingham-based Severn Trent is in trouble for supplying information to Ofwat that it used to assess the utility's performance to decide how much it could charge customers. In over 10,000 cases Severn Trent failed to provide the minimum standard of customer service expected by the regulator during 2005/6, an Ofwat spokesman said. Severn Trent has lowered charges by 2.4 pounds per household, or 10.6 million pounds in total, to ensure it has not profited in any way, it said on Tuesday, in response to Ofwat's proposed 35.8 million pounds ($71.2 million) fine. The fine is equivalent to around 3 percent of Severn Trent's 2006/07 revenue, Ofwat said. Severn Trent Chief Executive Tony Wray blamed the errors on the previous regime and culture from 2000 to 2004, which he said was "overly bureaucratic" and "lacked sufficient controls and procedures". Behaviour which led to the fine stretches back to 1997, Wray said, but Ofwat was only able to look at a 12-month period in 2005/6 because of the terms of the Water Act, a spokesman said. In 2005/6 over 3,000 customers received late responses to queries about bills and did not receive 20 pounds they were entitled to because of the late response, Ofwat said. Some customers were held waiting on the phone for too long and others simply couldn't get through, Ofwat said. Severn Trent could face further fines by a judge when it appears in court for falsifying leakage data in 2001 and 2002, its CEO told journalists on a conference call. Wray, who became CEO in October, 2006, having joined as managing director in March, 2005, said he could not estimate the size of the potential court fine because the company was entering "unchartered territory" for a water utility. "Anything of this nature is a place you don't want to be, what happened under previous regimes was unacceptable and it's our duty to make amends for that," said Wray. Severn Trent intends to plead guilty to two charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office relating specifically to leakage data. A third charge relating to 2000 was dropped. There will be no prosecutions of individuals but all those involved have left the company, Wray said. "Today's announcement is a positive as fines relating to effectively two issues (customer services and providing false information) are resolved. However, Severn is also pending a court case for a separate charge and until that is resolved (it may take a year) we still believe it is unlikely to come in play for M&A," said UBS analyst Per Lekander in a "buy" note. "Severn Trent Water's behaviour was unacceptable," said Ofwat Chief Executive Regina Finn in a statement. The Serious Fraud Office case was expected to go before the City of London Magistrates' Court at 0930 GMT on Tuesday. It is expected to progress to the Crown Court sometime in the next few months when the SFO will present its case. Shares in Severn Trent were almost flat at 1054 GMT, valuing the company at around 3.4 billion poun
