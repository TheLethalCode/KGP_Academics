 JERUSALEM, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met on Monday for the first time in more than a month with little sign of progress in peace talks marred by disputes over settlements and violence. The United States has stepped up pressure on both sides to take confidence-building steps ahead of a visit by US President George W. Bush in May. But Olmert has said he will push ahead with building within major Jewish settlement blocs and Jerusalem despite international protests. Monday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since Feb. 19. Abbas briefly broke off contacts last month following Israel's killing of more than 120 Palestinians, many of them civilians, in an offensive in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Israel said the incursion was intended to counter cross-border rocket fire by militants. Palestinian and Israeli officials said the meeting, at Olmert's Jerusalem residence, would be a chance to assess the state of peace talks launched at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November. Washington hopes the two sides can clinch a statehood agreement before Bush leaves office next January. "We are negotiating in all seriousness and seek to reach a settlement to all final-status issues, but the settlement will not be at any price," Abbas told members of his Fatah faction on Sunday. Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip in June after routing Fatah forces, called Abbas's talks with Olmert "a farce". The lead negotiators -- Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie -- have been meeting regularly and were to take part in Monday's session with Olmert and Abbas, Israeli officials said. ROAD MAP The long-stalled "road map" peace plan, at the heart of the first Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in seven years, requires the Jewish state to halt all settlement activity in the West Bank and uproot outposts built without government authorisation. It obliges the Palestinians to rein in militants. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Saturday that Abbas would use Monday's meeting to present his position that Israel has not met any of its initial road map commitments. Washington has said neither side has done nearly enough to fulfil their obligations, but U.S. officials have in private been particularly critical of Israel for announcing a series of construction projects in and around Arab East Jerusalem. Israel considers all of Jerusalem its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. After a visit last week by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Israel said it removed 50 roadblocks in the West Bank, a figure that could not be independently verified because the army would not release a map showing the location of the barriers. Hundreds more roadblocks rema
