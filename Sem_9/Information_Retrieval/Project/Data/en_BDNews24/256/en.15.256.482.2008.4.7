<TEXT>
 Tokyo, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's government picked acting central bank governor Masaaki Shirakawa as its nominee on Monday to head the Bank of Japan permanently, finally finding a candidate the veto-wielding opposition is likely to back after weeks of crisis. The government, scrambling to resolve a row that has left the BOJ without a leader for the first time in 80 years, wants a permanent governor in place in time for a G7 meeting on Friday in Washington that will look at strategy on turbulent global markets and concern about a US recession. But while the government's third go at picking a governor is likely to be approved in parliament, with senior opposition lawmakers expressing support, the row may carry on in a fight over the latest government nominee for deputy governor. Alongside Shirakawa, the government nominated former finance ministry bureaucrat Hiroshi Watanabe for deputy governor, ruling party upper house lawmaker Hiroshige Seko said, despite opposition concern about former finance ministry officials serving at the central bank. The nomination of Shirakawa comes just before a two-day BOJ policy meeting starting on Tuesday, which he is already set to chair as acting governor. The meeting is not expected to cut Japan's already very low rates but will be watched closely for any sign the central bank has become more pessimistic about the economy. Financial markets have been more focused on U.S. problems, but analysts say Japan needs to send a permanent BOJ head to the G7 meeting because a stand-in would likely be unable to commit to long-term decisions in talks with other central bankers. SHIRAKAWA UNCONTROVERSIAL Shirakawa, a former top BOJ official, is seen by economists as a logical choice to break the political logjam. "Shirakawa, as a career central banker, is expected to act flexibly if economic and financial market conditions worsen," said Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist at RBS Securities. Opposition parties, which control parliament's upper house and can thus veto nominees to head the BOJ, rejected the government's two previous candidates because they spent much of their careers in the finance ministry, a connection the lawmakers said would threaten the BOJ's independence in monetary policy. The showdown reflects a broader political impasse that is undermining confidence in Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who is already suffering public doubts about his leadership that have cut his support rates to 24 percent, a public poll by the Mainichi newspaper showed. Parliament is set to quiz the two nominees on Tuesday, ahead of a vote likely on Wednesday -- leaving just enough time for Shirakawa to catch a flight to Washington. Helping Shirakawa's case is that he has already won parliamentary backing as a deputy governor last month. Shirakawa himself has shrugged off labels such as hawk or dove, saying only that his views are not that different from those of the BOJ before his appointment as deputy governor. Investors are pricing in around a 20 percent chance of a BOJ rate cut by June and a 50 percent chance of a cut by the end of the year. Economists are less sure, with Yamazaki saying he expected no change in the central bank's main policy rate of 0.5 percent for at least another year -- a view shared by a portfolio manager responsible for Japan strategies at PIMCO. "If the BOJ is forced to change its scenario for the worse, a rate cut could be proposed," Yamazaki said. "Still, Shirakawa is an advocate of normalising interest rates, so he will likely raise rates to more normal levels in the long run if uncertainties over the U.S. and Japanese economies clear." WATANABE'S PAST Watanabe's appointment is less certain, as he is a former vice finance minister for international affairs. To get the job he would need support from the main opposition Democratic Party, which opposes the custom of alternating top BOJ posts between central bankers and finance ministry bureaucrats. That system is an example of "amakudari", or descent from heaven, whereby bureaucrats parachute into cushy jobs after retiring. Democrat leader Ichiro Ozawa said the issue did not arise with Shirakawa, a career central banker. But asked if Watanabe could replace Shirakawa as deputy governor, he said: "The opinion that it is not desirable for this post to take the form of amakudari is held by many in the par
