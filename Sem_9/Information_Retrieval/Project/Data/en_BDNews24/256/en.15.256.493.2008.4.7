 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University conferred honorary doctor of law degrees Monday on two Language Movement veterans, ANM Gaziul Haque and Abdul Matin, for their roles in the Bangla-language struggle of 1952. On receiving his award Matin said: "I consider the honour an acknowledgement of the language movement not the acknowledgement of my personal role." Chancellor of Dhaka University, president Iajuddin Ahmed, handed over the honorary degrees at the 44th convocation held at the university's central sports ground. Abdul Matin received his award in person, while Gaziul Haque's children received the award on his behalf as the language hero could not be present at the ceremony due to illness. This year's convocation marked the first time Dhaka University has awarded any honorary degree to a language veteran. Abdul Matin, in his convocation speech, said: "We should consider the language martyrs Salam, Barkat, Jabbar and Rafiq as national heroes. To pay respect to the martyrs means paying respect the nation and its traditions." The language veteran expressed sorrow that Bangla had not been established in every sphere of the state. He suggested forming a commission in this regard, including politicians and academics, and implementing the necessary measures following their recommendations. "Steps should also be taken for the younger generation so that they can learn other important languages, including English," the language movement veteran said, acknowledging the importance of English in this day and age. "Dhaka University can play the leading role in this regard," he added. "The dreams we cherished in 1952 and 1971 have not been fulfilled yet," Matin said. "But today's young students can do the job to implement our incomplete and unfulfilled dreams, which requires sacrifices and a patriotic heart." On his award of the honorary doctorate degree, he said: "I consider the honour an acknowledgement of the language movement, not the acknowledgement of my personal role." Acting DU registrar Rezaur Rahman read out the written speech of fellow language veteran ANM Gaziul Haque, in which he said: "The university through conferring the honorary doctorate degree pays respect not only to us, it also pays tribute to numerous students and protesters in the language movement." "I am overwhelmed," the language hero wrote. bdnews24.c
