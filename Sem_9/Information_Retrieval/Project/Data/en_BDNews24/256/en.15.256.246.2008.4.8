 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)A GMG Airlines plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangkok Tuesday after a man with a knife caused a panic among passengers and crew, officials said. GMG spokesperson Shahadat Rahman told bdnews24.com that the flight Z5042, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka, requested an emergency landing at around 9.30am over the Thai capital, after an unruly passenger misbehaved with a member of the cabin crew. Aviation authorities directed the plane to land at Bangkok's domestic Don Mueang airport, Rahman said, adding that the passenger Harun Rashid Hasan Ali (25) was detained at the airport for questioning. German news agency DPA had reported that the passenger sparked suspicions by using his own fruit knife at breakfast, while AFP quoted Chaisak Angkasuan, head of the Department of Civil Aviation, as saying: "Authorities had no idea how he got it on the plane." The authorities eventually decided Harun had not intended to pose any threat, and will not be pressing any charges, GMG spokeperson Rahman said. Harun had been working in Malaysia for the past three months, but was being deported back home by the GMG flight after he got the sack. Bangkok authorities said Harun would be sent on to Dhaka Tuesday night by another plane. The GMG flight Z5042 left Bangkok's domestic airport soon after Harun was removed from the plane, and landed back in Dhaka at 2.30pm Tuesday afternoon, Rahman said. bdnews
