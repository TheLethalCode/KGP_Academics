<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The life and times of Pamela Anderson, the thrice-married former Playboy model and "Baywatch" star, will be featured in a new documentary-style show on E! television, the network said on Monday. The half-hour series, now called "Pamela," is set to air on the US cable TV network in the summer months and will be produced by the company behind the critically lauded documentary "The Eyes of Tammy Faye," about one-time TV evangelist Tammy Faye Baker Messner, who died last year. The show will be "in the style of a uniquely shot documentary film," Randy Barbato, managing director of World of Wonder Productions, said in a statement. Anderson's life has been fodder for tabloids and she is constantly followed by paparazzi. She rose to stardom as a nude model and actress on the hit TV comedy "Home Improvement," and later became a star on the 1990s TV series "Baywatch," playing a beach lifeguard. More recently, Anderson, 40, starred in her own crime series, "V.I.P." But she is perhaps best known for her off-screen affairs and three marriages, starting with rocker Tommy Lee, with whom she has two children. A sex video of Lee and Anderson was posted on the Internet in the late 1990s. The two are now divorced. Anderson wed singer Kid Rock in 2006 but they divorced after less than six months. In October she married Rick Salomon but that marriage ended in March
