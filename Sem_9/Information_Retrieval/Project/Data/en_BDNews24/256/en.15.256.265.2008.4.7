<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Recent advice from Titas Gas to restrict the gas supply to certain areas in the country has seriously threatened the viability of the textiles sector, Abdul Hye Sarker, president of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said Monday. The BTMA chief raised the concern at a press conference in the association's office following advice from Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company to reduce industrial units consumption of gas by 40 percent from 6pm to 11pm in Dhaka city and surrounding areas. "The decision came as a bolt from the blue. It will inevitably bring disaster to the textile sector," said Sarker. Sarker said textile mills registered with the association remained open round the clock in three shifts, and that if the advice was followed one of those shifts would be eliminated completely. The BTMA president said that 80 percent of the textile sector in Bangladesh was export oriented, and such a move would also result in cancelled orders and fines. "At the same time, the hard-earned export market may slip away and our reputations will be damaged in the international market," he said. "If the gas supply is reduced, it will not be possible to achieve the government's export target of $11.285 billion." "In addition, the overall loss in the textiles sector would reach around Tk 110 crore," he said. bdnew
