 MIAMI, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexican Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said his government hopes to see world economic leaders press China for a further strengthening of the yuan when they gather for meetings in Washington later this week. "China should continue allowing the appreciation of its currency versus the (US) dollar," Carstens told Reuters on Sunday. A stronger yuan should allow for "a more balanced distribution of the adjustment" in world trade, Carstens added, speaking on the sidelines of an annual Inter-American Development Bank meeting in Miami. He was referring to how yuan weakness, even amid the US dollar's recent decline against the euro and other leading world currencies, is keeping China's exports cheap and more attractive abroad. "This has been the purpose of discussions at the IMF for the last year and hopefully this issue will be addressed again next week," said Carstens. G-7 finance ministers and central bankers are due to meet on Friday in Washington, before the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Carstens, who warned in remarks to reporters earlier on Sunday about what he called the rise of "a protectionism movement around the world," did not elaborate on the China currency issue. China's foreign exchange rates have long been problem for developing countries competing against Chinese exports. There has also been speculation about possible currency hedges or shifts out of the dollar, and dollar-denominated assets, because of the beating the US currency has taken on world markets. Asked how the Mexican central bank is managing its foreign currency reserves, Carstens replied: "They're keeping their own same policy of diversifying. But they haven't undertaken action as a sovereign wealth fund really." The Mexican minister also said he hopes the next US president will recognize the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. "No matter who wins I hope that a clear evaluation of NAFTA takes place and that whoever wins realizes that NAFTA has been very good for the whole region," Carstens said. "It has been very good for Canada and for the US and for Mexico." Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the two Democratic presidential contenders, have vowed to change or even abandon NAFTA, causing uneasiness in the neighboring countries
