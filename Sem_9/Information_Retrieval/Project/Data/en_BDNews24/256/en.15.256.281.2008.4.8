 LOS ANGELES, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - George Clooney's box office woes deepened on Monday when final weekend sales figures showed his new comedy, "Leatherheads," opened at No. 3.

Some rival studios considered the initial "Leatherheads" estimate too high.

Clooney, 46, directed and starred in "Leatherheads," a $58 million project set in the rough-and-tumble early days of American professional football.

"21," a gambling drama released by Sony Corp's Columbia Pictures, earned $15.34 million during the weekend, about $240,000 more than was estimated Sunday.

It was released by Twentieth Century Fox, a unit of News Corp
