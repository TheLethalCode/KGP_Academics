<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will look to carry their home success against Ireland to the five-ODI series against Pakistan when they take on the hosts in the Tuesday series opener at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Satellite channel Ten Sports will telecast the match live from the venue with the game beginning at 3pm local time (4pm Bangladesh standard time). All matches including a lone Twenty20 will be day-night affairs. The Tigers had a nearly three-hour training under the floodlights at the Gaddafi Stadium Monday, according to Tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. On paper, Bangladesh are less strong than Ricky Ponting's Australia, but Bangladesh coach Siddons admits his side are still in a developing stage and he is confident the Tigers are capable of causing Pakistan problems. Pakistan was supposed to play Australia in the place of Bangladesh, invited to fill the void left by Australia's cancelling their trip on security grounds. "This side is very young both in terms of age and experience. But there is a lot of talent in the squad," said Siddons after arriving Pakistan. "Past results show Pakistan have dominated overwhelmingly (one win for Bangladesh in 18 ODIs against Pakistan) but we have the potential to surprise the opponents," added the Australian. The Tigers also focus on the consistency they showed against minnows Ireland. "Everyone has been talking how inconsistent we are. Bangladesh have shown they can beat the best side in the world on their day.... But we would like to prove that wrong in this series. If Pakistan slip up, we'll jump on them," said the former assistant coach of Australia. Siddons emphasised on sticking to the plans to overcome Pakistan. Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik, on the other hand, doesn't want to take Bangladesh lightly, and spoke of playing their best to win all matches. "We know they can be dangerous, so we will not take them lightly and play our best to win all the matches. This doesn't mean I am claiming to sweep them. We will try to achieve that with good work," said Malik. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful (cap), Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan, Roqibul Hassan, Farhad Reza, Dhiman Ghosh (wicketkeeper), Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Mahmudullah Riyad, Zunaed Siddique, Nazim Uddin and Shahadat Hossain. Pakistan: Shoaib Malik (captain), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal (Wicketkeeper), Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftikhar Anjum, Sohail Khan, Wahab Riaz, Fawad Alam, Bazid Khan and Sarfraz Ahmed (wicketkeeper).
