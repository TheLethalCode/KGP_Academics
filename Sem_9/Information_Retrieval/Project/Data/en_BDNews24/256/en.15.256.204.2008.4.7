<TITLE> EU loses another battle in WTO `banana wars` </TITLE>

 Geneva, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's contentious import regime for bananas still breaks international trade rules, a World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel said on Monday. The ruling, confirming a preliminary judgement issued last November, found that EU regulations are blocking access to the world's biggest banana market for fruit from Ecuador, despite attempts by Brussels to reform them. If upheld, the ruling would entitle Ecuador to seek WTO authorisation to impose trade sanctions on the bloc. A spokesman for the EU executive said Brussels was considering an appeal. "The Commission disagrees with the conclusions of the panel report. The panel has adopted a purely formalistic approach," said European Commission agriculture spokesman Michael Mann. "We are considering an appeal to the panel report." Ecuador, the world's biggest banana exporter, brought the case in 1996 with Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States. Three further Latin American producers -- Colombia, Nicaragua and Panama -- have also joined the dispute. Ecuador says EU import duties of 176 euros ($276.50) a tonne discriminate against its banana industry. That is because the EU had previously granted preferential treatment to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, who are mainly former European colonies, allowing them to import a duty-free quota of 775,000 tonnes a year. "The European Communities' current banana import regime, in particular its preferential tariff quota reserved for ACP countries, is inconsistent with (WTO rules)," the WTO panel said in a 409-page report. That system was announced in 2005 in an effort by Brussels to reform a regime originally found illegal by the WTO in 1999. Because the ACP preferences discriminated in favour of some exporters, they were only allowed under a WTO waiver, which expired at the end of 2007. Brussels has since negotiated interim economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with most of the affected countries, although many non-governmental organisations argued that the new agreements were unfair to developing countries. "Most of the (WTO panel) report is largely academic. The preference for ACP bananas examined by the panel no longer exists," said Mann. "But we regret that the panel has not taken into account market data." "Latin American suppliers have largely benefitted from the EU regime introduced in 2006. Imports from these countries have increased by more than 14 percent compared with the previous regime," he said. The EPAs eliminate the tariff-free quota for ACP countries, but Ecuadorean banana exporters say they may challenge the new regime at the WTO because they believe they unfairly favour EU producers -- in the Canary Islands, Azores, Madeira, Guadeloupe and Martinique -- and that the tariffs are too high.
