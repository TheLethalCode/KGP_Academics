 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)  Over 100 Bangladesh Chhatra League members brought out a silent procession Monday protesting president Iajuddin Ahmed's presence at the 44th convocation of Dhaka University. The protestors wore black facecloths and black badges as they marched from Modhu's Canteen on the campus, hoisting banners with inscriptions such as: "Iajuddin, enemy of education, go back, go back; enemy of democracy, go back, go back". The procession, led by DU's Chhatra League president and general secretary, ended in front of the Aparajeo Bangla monument with the protestors rallying there for some time. They declared Iajuddin Ahmed persona non grata on the DU campus. Sohel Rana Tipu, president of the university's BCL wing, said: "The role of professor Iajuddin during national crises have been demeaning." "His role in handling the August 2007 student unrest was thoroughly unbecoming of a teacher." Tipu called upon students to refrain from accepting certificates at the convocation ceremony presided over by the president. A number of students that had been detained in connection with the August 2007 campus violence were seen marching with the protestors. bdnews24.com
