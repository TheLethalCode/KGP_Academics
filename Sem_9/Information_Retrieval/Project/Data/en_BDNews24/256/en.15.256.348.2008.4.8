 PORT OF SPAIN, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies cricket fans have grown weary of false dawns during a decade of decline but after tying the two-test series with Sri Lanka, captain Chris Gayle said progress was finally being made. "The communication with each other is very good, the guys really rally around each other and are pointing out areas that we need to work on," Gayle said after Sunday's six-wicket win in an absorbing test against the Sri Lankans. Whatever work remains to be done in all departments of the game, the West Indians have a smile on their faces again after ending a streak of seven successive series defeats. At last year's World Cup the team, then captained by Brian Lara who has since retired and coached by Australian Bennett King, were tense to the point of grumpiness. But in this series there has been a camaraderie not seen for some time in the West Indies camp and after Sunday's win, the younger members of the team were back on the field playing soccer. "The guys have been enjoying their cricket more which is good to see. Once you are enjoying the game then you should be able to better results -- that is a key area," said the quietly spoken Gayle who is leading the team for the first time in a home series. Leading batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan, who after a 10-month lay-off has returned in this series to score three half-centuries and then a match winning 102 on Sunday, said Gayle has proven to be the right choice for skipper. 'GREAT JOB' "I think Chris has done a great job with the team and everyone has been rallying around him -- I don't think at the moment there is anyone who could do a better job," he said. "He is the most calm person I've ever seen on a cricket field, he has been quiet in the dressing room but whenever he needs to say something he says it and I think that is great. When he needs to put his foot down, he puts his foot down." The improvements, on the field, are not hard to identify. Opening bowler Jerome Taylor, who took 4-52 in the second innings, has matured, now moving the ball both ways and combining pace with consistent accuracy. Fiery Fidel Edwards, who took four wickets in the first innings, bowled with better control than in the past and wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin was immaculate. The fielding was sharp but it will need some great consistency from the leading batsmen if West Indies are to be competitive in their next series against Australia.# Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who made an unbeaten 86 on Sunday, remains a dependable part of the middle-order. But Gayle is keen to get a big score himself and Marlon Samuels is desperately in need of a good innings after managing just 29 runs in his last four knocks. Gayle knows there remains plenty of work if his team are to begin the climb up the world rankings from a lowly eighth place among test nations. "This is just a start. If we can get the support we need off the field, and things can get better for the players and we continue to work as a unit we can enjoy many more days like this," he said
