<TEXT>
 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harrods store owner Mohamed al-Fayed still thinks British security services could have been involved in the deaths of his son Dodi and Princess Diana in a Paris car crash despite the verdict of an inquest jury. But former bodyguard Trevor Rees, sole survivor of the 1997 crash, said he agrees with the verdict that they were unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of their chauffeur and paparazzi photographers pursuing them.

"No one should be above the law." "I have always believed that Prince Philip and the queen hold valuable evidence that only they know," he said. In stark contrast, Trevor Rees echoed Diana's sons Princes William and Harry in accepting the jury's ruling and trying finally to put the tragedy behind them. Rees, who suffered horrific facial injuries in the crash in a Paris road tunnel but survived because he was wearing a seat belt, said: "I hope that this now represents a point from which everyone involved can move on." In their statement welcoming the verdict, William and Harry said: "We are particularly grateful to Trevor Rees and to others who came forward to give evidence -- in many cases reawakening their painful and personal memorie
