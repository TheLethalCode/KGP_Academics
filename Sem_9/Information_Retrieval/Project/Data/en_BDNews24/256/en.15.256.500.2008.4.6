<TEXT>
 Gazipur, April 6 (bdnews24.com)Countries which have experience of dealing with natural disasters can better contribute to the peacekeeping mission under the United Nations, a US military official said Sunday. For disaster management, troops need same approaches that also go for peacekeeping missions in any conflict-torn region, said Lt Col Edward Tanguy, commander of the 249th Regional Training Institute. Tanguy said the experience of managing natural calamities is an "important capital" for countries like Bangladesh to be an effective contributor to the peacekeeping mission. Tanguy talked to reporters at Rajendrapur Cantonment in Gazipur as a three-week training course began with some 400 troops from 12 countries. The courseShanti Doot-2, or Ambassador of Peacebegan at a ceremonial inauguration with participants from Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tonga, and the United States. The Bangladesh Armed Forces is the host of the exercise course with the financial and technical support from the US. Air Marshall SM Ziaur Rahman opened the course. The exercise is designed to enhance regional capacity for peacekeeping operations among the Pacific-rim countries, promote professional relationships and goodwill, all while demonstrating the US resolve in support of the security interests of regional allies. Tanguy said the approach of engaging people from diverse cultural and religious background is also important for an effective peacekeeping effort. Muslim nations, especially the Muslim-majority regions ravaged by conflicts, can also contribute more, he said. He said the more diverse the peacekeeping elements are, the higher the chances of operations' success. Tanguy said the current exercise in Bangladesh would benefit the participating countries. According to course details, the soldiers would gather knowledge about checkpoint operations, patrolling, secure distribution sites, convoy operations, cordon and search and disarmament. "This exercise provides us with an opportunity to exchange tactics, techniques and procedures at the tactical level with all the multinational forces," Tanguy said. "Our goal is to enhance the readiness and interoperability of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the US Army and other multination participant forces," he said. Bangladesh is the second largest contributors of troops to the UN-sponsored peacekeeping mission with 9,856 soldiers. Pakistan tops the list with 10,610 peacekeepers while India has 9,357 peacekeepers in the UN mission. bd
