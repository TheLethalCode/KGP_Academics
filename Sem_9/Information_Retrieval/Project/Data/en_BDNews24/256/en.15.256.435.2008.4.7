 Rome, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A threat to "take up arms" by one of Silvio Berlusconi's allies in a row over ballot papers for April 13-14's vote infuriated the centre left on Monday, which called it a sign of what Italy can expect if the right wins. Media tycoon Berlusconi, who has a lead of 5-9 points over his centre-left challenger Walter Veltroni in polls, dismissed the threat by his cantankerous far-right ally Umberto Bossi as a "metaphor", adding: "There are no guns." But Veltroni, unusually agitated for a man who cultivates a moderate image, asked what sort of government could be formed by people like Bossi, who was minister of reform in Berlusconi's last government until he suffered a stroke in 2004. "Can someone who says such words be minister of reform? What kind of country do we live in?" asked Veltroni. "These words are incompatible with the responsibility of government. But the worst thing is the silence of his coalition colleagues." Berlusconi denied he had promised a cabinet post to Bossi, the 66-year-old leader of the Northern League which is one of the two main allies of Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL). "Watch out, these elections could end up with us taking up our rifles and going out to shoot this carrion," Bossi told a few hundred supporters on the weekend, thundering against "Roman scoundrels who printed ballot papers you can't even vote with". He is not the only one angered by ballot papers on which the two biggest parties' logos -- of Berlusconi's PDL and Veltroni's Democratic Party (PD) -- are attached in each case to their main ally, while all others parties are presented individually. Critics, including Berlusconi and Bossi but also Veltroni's closest ally on the centre left, say there is a risk of spoilt ballots and want tens of millions of them to be reprinted. BLAME THE "PIG" PD deputy leader Dario Franceschini said the ballot "risks being confusing" but blamed it squarely on electoral rules drawn up by Berlusconi's last government -- which detail exactly how big each logo must be and how close to that of allied parties. That law, which the centre right rushed through just before losing to centre-left leader Romano Prodi in 2006, favoured the formation of unstable coalitions with a tiny Senate majority of the kind that brought down Prodi's coalition in January. Even its own authors called it "rubbish" and it is nicknamed the "Porcellum", Latin for pig. Italy's election, which began dramatically enough when Prodi resigned after just 20 months in office but soon settled into an unusually dull contest, is certainly making up for lost time. Last week it nearly screeched to a halt when the interior ministry acknowledged that a legal challenge from a tiny party, excluded for having a logo too similar to a larger party's, may force the mid-April vote to be postponed, possibly for weeks. Giuseppe Pizza, whose Christian Democrats are allied to Berlusconi, withdrew his challenge after howls of protest. Both main contenders, who before Prodi's fall held talks on political reform, have now taken the gloves off. Veltroni says he has a serious chance after making "the most spectacular recovery in history" and says Berlusconi is afraid of losing. The 52-year-old former mayor of Rome has also broached the subject of Berlusconi's age -- 71 -- and says his rival no longer has the "will or energy" to run the country. "I will be his age in 2026," Veltroni pointed out, adding that "in Europe, all prime ministers are more or less my age". But Berlusconi, who looks younger than his years thanks to his suntan, hair transplant and dazzling smile, told supporters as he made his fifth bid for the prime ministership in 14 years that "this will certainly not be my last campaig
