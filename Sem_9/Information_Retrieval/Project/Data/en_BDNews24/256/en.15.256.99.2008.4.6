<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  Canada is ready to provide Bangladesh with transparent ballot boxes free of cost for the upcoming national polls, an election commissioner said Sunday. Commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said a deal would be penned soon to start the process. Solhul said the commission would inform the Canadian government about how many boxes it would need for the polls expected by the year-end. The new development came after Sohul on March 18 told bdnews24.com that the Election Commission had scrapped a previous plan to manufacture transparent boxes at home to save money and time. Demand for transparent ballot boxes was loud from the Awami League-led alliance to check vote rigging. The commission under the leadership of former CEC MA Aziz had turned down the Awami League's demand. The commission had earlier rejected a proposal by the European Union that offered to supply the boxes. The EC in October 2006 requested the Canadian High Commission to supply boxes for 9.5 crore voters but the diplomatic mission had said it would take two years for that. It also informed the EC that the cost of manufacturing the boxes in Canada would be Tk 35 crore. Earlier, Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory made 11,000 such boxes for the Jan 21 polls that were later forestalled. bdnews
