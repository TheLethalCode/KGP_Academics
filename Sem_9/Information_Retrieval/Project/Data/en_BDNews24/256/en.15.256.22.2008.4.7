<TITLE> Seahorses found in cleaner Thames </TITLE>

The news has been kept secret until now because the seahorse has not been protected. But from Monday, the marine creature and its environment will have protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. The seahorse has been spotted near Dagenham, Tilbury and Southend. It is thought to be mainly a salt water creature, so it is not clear how far up the Thames it will go. So little information is available on the short-snouted seahorse that it is not clear how endangered they are. But the Zoological Society of London, which released its findings, said it indicated the Thames was becoming cleaner. "Usually found in shallow muddy waters, estuaries or seagrass beds, their presence in the Thames estuary is another good sign that the water quality of the river is improving," a spokesman for the society said. There are signs that the seahorse is breeding on the south coast too. But it warned any disturbance to its habitats could be disastrous. Other creatures protected by the Act from Monday include the water vole, angel shark, Roman snail and long-snouted seahor
