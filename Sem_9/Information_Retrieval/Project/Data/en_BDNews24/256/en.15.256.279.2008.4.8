 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Visiting Saudi deputy minister for labour Ahmed Abdulraham Al-Mansour said Monday his country had not imposed restrictions on the intake of manpower from Bangladesh. The kingdom only tried to "rationalise" its labour policy to maintain a "balance" among workers coming from different countries, said the deputy minister, now in Dhaka to attend a two-day meeting of Bangladesh-Saudi Arabia Joint Economic Commission. "Saudi Arabia has not banned manpower import from Bangladesh. We have tried to rationalise and modernise our labour laws with a view to striking a balance among the workers coming from different countries," he told reporters after his meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. In March, the Saudi government reportedly imposed restrictions on Bangladeshi workers to be employed for household and agricultural activities. Bangladesh provides the largest number of foreign workers in the kingdom. According to the Saudi embassy in Dhaka, 17.65 lakh Bangladeshis live in Saudi Arabia. The deputy minister said Saudi and Bangladeshi governments would work out a solution to any problem to maintain friendly relations between the two Muslim nations. The Saudi embassy in Dhaka started issuing visas for Bangladeshis Sunday after weeks of suspension for "technical reasons". The embassy has already issued 1,900 visas and is set to approve another 2,000 visas Monday, an embassy official said. bdn
