 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com) - The GP-BCB academy team responded well to the South Africa academy team, riding on a fine century from Imrul Kayes at the close of the third day of the first four-dayer Sunday. The hosts piled up 319 for four at stumps to take an eight-run lead after the visitors ended up with 311 all out at Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore. Jahurul Islam Omee gave the hosts an excellent start to have played a 18-ball 19 that was studded with two fours and one six, before the opener was caught by Vilas off CJ de Villiers, leaving the side at 41 for one. Opener Imrul paring with one-down Nasiruddin Faruk (28) added 59 runs for the second wicket and 177 with Nayeem Islam for the third wicket before he was caught by Neil Wanger off Abdullah Aziz Temoor for 151. Nayeem and Mehrab Hossain Jr (10) put on 42 for the fourth wicket before the latter was Temoor's second victim in the match. Nayeem was on his way to the deserved century with 96 not out while Shamsur Rahman Shuvo was on nought when the bails were drawn for the third day play. Earlier, the visitors, having resumed the day on 295 for eight, added another 16 runs to finish at 311 all out as pacer Nazmul Hossain raised his tally to four for 63 from three for 41. Pacer Dollar Mahmud had the last batsman Mondil Mahlombe caught behind by Musfiqur Rahim to end the visitors' innings.
