 Kabul, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's government has no information on wether a wanted guerrilla leader was in a village hit by a US-led air strike in the east of the country this week, a spokesman said on Tuesday. Afghan authorities are investigating the air attack on what the Afghan and US militaries said were heavily armed insurgents in the province of Nuristan.

More than 500 civilians were killed during operations by foreign troops against the Taliban last year, according to aid groups and some Afghan officials. Karzai has repeatedly called on US and NATO-led forces to do everything they can to avoid killing civilians. The Taliban have vowed to step up their war to expel foreign troops and bring down Karzai's government and there has been intermittent fighting in recent weeks after a traditional winter lu
