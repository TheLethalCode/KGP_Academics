<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 06 (bdnews24.com)Plans by UK-based mining firm GCM Resources for a controversial open-cast mining operation in Phulbari have been thrown into doubt after the Asian Development Bank pulled a $300 million loan agreement this weekend, British newspaper The Observer reported Sunday. The process of open-cast mining, and its resulting environmental and social impact, has faced controversy in Bangladesh, with GCM's proposed project in particular meeting with widespread opposition. An official of ADB's Dhaka office told bdnews24.com: "We will review this. We have been considering this project. Now we are waiting for the Bangladesh government's decision regarding this project." "We will monitor the situation, and see how the safeguard programme will be implemented," he added. GCM is planning to mine an estimated 572 million tonnes of coal in a project that will displace up to 120,000 people from the Phulbari area, divert a river, and destroy part of the world heritage-listed Sundarbans. Three people were killed during protests in Phulbari in 2006. In a statement, quoted by The Observer, the ADB said: "We think it is premature to continue dialogue with the private sector under current circumstances. So, at this stage we are open to suggestions of the government of Bangladesh, civil society and other stakeholders and prepared to review our engagement in this project to ensure that all sensitivities, including concerns relating to safeguard issues, are fully considered." GCM was quoted by the British newspaper as saying: 'We haven't received any communication from ADB to suggest it is unwilling to finance the project. The government of Bangladesh is reviewing this project and we are awaiting its decision.' bdn
