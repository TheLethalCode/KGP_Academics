 CHICAGO (April 07,Reuters/bdnews24.com) - From Ann Taylor to Sears to Wilsons The Leather Experts, it seems the only thing retailers are moving out the doors these days is jobs. Since the beginning of 2008, retailers -- beset by an environment where scared consumers have slashed spending on apparel and discretionary items -- have eliminated 75,000 jobs, according to Labor Department data released on Friday. That accounts for almost one-third of the non-farm payroll jobs lost this year. What's worse for the U.S. economy is the cuts are likely not just a reaction to weak sales, but also a sign that retailers do not expect improvement any time soon, analysts said. "As they come through the last two or three quarters, they are beginning to realize there isn't an end in sight," said Wendy Liebmann, chief executive at consulting firm WSL Strategies. Retailers are anticipating "the next shoe, or the other shoe or the other shoe, to drop going forward." Retailers typically cut some jobs in the first quarter as they come down from the holiday sales season. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to factor out such seasonal fluctuations. Even if an early Easter this year turns out to have skewed the data somewhat, the trend is still negative, said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. "It's a tough environment for all retailers: high-end, low-end, middle," he said. WORST CUTS SINCE 2003 The retail job cuts in the first quarter are the largest quarterly cuts in five years. Retailers have been hammered as consumers have faced rising gasoline prices, falling home values, tighter credit standards and concerns about job security. "What we're seeing today is a consumer who is buying virtually nothing, unless it's a need item," said Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group. "If it's a want item, they aren't buying it." Many retailers have responded by cutting costs, including jobs. Among those announced this year: Macy's Inc plans 2,300 job cuts, Wilsons The Leather Experts said it would cut 938 jobs, AnnTaylor Stores Corp said it would cut 13 percent of its headquarters staff and Sears Holdings Corp said it was cutting 200 support staff. Tax refund checks typically spur purchases of big-ticket items, but the money may be used to pay down debt or buy necessities this year, he said. "You're just seeing consumers realize that they don't have any extra money," Beemer said. "The consumer, at this time, has no choice in where to spend their money." One-off tax rebates meant to stimulate the economy also might be spent on essentials, too. "It's difficult to see anything on the horizon that would spur consumer spending that would require retailers to" add jobs, said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Still, WSL's Liebmann warns that retailers need to be careful about how deeply they cut, as consumers that are already being careful about spending may be turned off by shoddy customer service. "One of the dangers in cutting people in the stores is people will feel they aren't being taken care of and so they will go elsewhere," Liebmann said. "This is a very different time when shoppers are looking for much more TLC (tender loving care) because they are just as nervous as the retailer.
