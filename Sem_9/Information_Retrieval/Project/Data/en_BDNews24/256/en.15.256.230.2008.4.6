 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)An ordinance designed to form the Truth and Accountability Commission has been sent to the law ministry for further review, a government spokesman said Sunday. The cabinet discussed in detail the Voluntary Disclosure of Information Ordinance 2008 at a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters in a post-meeting press briefing. The government had earlier formed a four-member committee to make a draft on the proposed commission. The committee had designed the structure and legal affairs of the commission, which would continue for one year initially. The committee had recommended naming the commission "Truth and Accountability Commission". The draft said any person can enjoy the facilities of the commission, but the persons who have already been accused in cases pending trial will not qualify. In another decision, the interim cabinet Sunday approved an agreement between Dhaka and Kolkata on train services, scheduled to start on April 14. bdnews24.c
