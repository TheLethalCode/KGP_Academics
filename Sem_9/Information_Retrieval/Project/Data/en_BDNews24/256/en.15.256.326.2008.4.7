 KATHMANDU, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations said it was worried about the security of voters ahead of this week's historic national elections, as authorities prepared to halt campaigning from Tuesday to help ensure a smooth election. Nepalis will vote on Thursday for a 601-member constituent assembly, the centrepiece of a landmark peace deal with former Maoist rebels, meant to prepare a new constitution, most likely abolish the monarchy and turn the nation into a republic.

Pokharel said the security situation improved after the government mobilised 135,000 police. Nepal has also banned the sale of alcohol as well as the use of private and public transport on election day.
