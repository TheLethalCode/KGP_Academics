 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)The 44th convocation of Dhaka University began at 10:00am Monday. The celebrations started with a formal procession from Curzon Hall premises led by DU's chancellor President Iajuddin Ahmed to the convocation venue at the university's central sports ground. Dhaka University will confer honorary doctor of law degrees this year upon two Language Movement veterans, ANM Gaziul Haque and Abdul Matin. Abdul Matin will deliver the convocation speech on the occasion. DU's 44th convocation will confer graduate and post-graduate degrees upon 3,885 successful students, of whom 2,042 are female and 1,843 male. Twenty-four will receive MPhil degrees, 29 PhDs and 52 will be awarded gold medals for spectacular results. Extensive security measures have been put in place in and around the campus after DU Jatiyatabadi Chhatradal and Bangladesh Chhatra League protested the president's role on the occasion. JCD had earlier declared it would boycott the convocation altogether, while BCL had announced that they would oppose the president's entry into the campus. Left-leaning teachers and Awami League sympathisers among the DU faculty had also voiced disapproval of Iajuddin's role in Monday's convocation. bdnews24.com/
