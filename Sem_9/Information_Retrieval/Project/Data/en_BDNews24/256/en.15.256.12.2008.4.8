The release of Guterres is likely to anger human rights groups, who have criticised Indonesia's efforts to bring those responsible for the bloodshed in East Timor to justice. Seventeen other men, who were indicted by Jakarta prosecutors, had earlier been set free following their acquittals by the appellate court or the Supreme Court. The United Nations estimates about 1,000 people were killed in the violence but Indonesian officials have said only about 100 people died. A truth commission set up by the two countries in 2005 is investigating the bloody events but it does not have any power to prosecute, and rights activists say it only serves to whitewash the crimes.
