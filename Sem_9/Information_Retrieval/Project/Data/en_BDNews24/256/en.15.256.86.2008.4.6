 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)Awami League front organisation Bangladesh Krishak League observed a daylong hunger strike Sunday at the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue demanding release of detained AL president Sheikh Hasina. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed formally declared the hunger strike open at 10 am; the strike ended at 5pm. Tofail, in a brief speech delivered on the occasion, asked the government: "Release Sheikh Hasina immediately and arrange her proper medical treatment." "We are not the government's antagonists, rather we'd like to cooperate with the administration," he said, urging the government to take heed. He also called upon the caretaker government to ensure elections according to the declared roadmap, lift the state of emergency and allow indoor politics immediately. AL organising secretary MA Mannan Sheikh demanded the release of Sheikh Hasina and said one kilogramme of rice during the AL regime cost only Tk 10, which has soared to Tk 45 in 2008. "Hungry people will not abide by the emergency rule and will eventually come out on the streets," he warned. He called upon the caretaker government to "control consumer prices and leave politics alone." AL agriculture secretary Dr Abdur Razzak, Krishak League president Mirza Abdul Jalil, and other leaders and workers of the organisation and other front organisations were present. bdnews24.com/ms
