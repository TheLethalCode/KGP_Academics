 VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Search crews found the body on Monday of a Japanese snowboarder who disappeared last month from the slopes of one of Canada's most popular ski resorts. Ai Ito was found downstream from where she was believed to have been snowboarding at the Whistler-Blackcomb resort in British Columbia. She had apparently been injured in an accident and later died from the cold, police said. Ito was last seen alive on March 20, but she was not reported missing until March 23 because the family she was staying with while studying English in Canada thought she was spending the holiday weekend with friends. The mountain area near Vancouver received substantial snowfall between the time when Ito disappeared and the search began, hampering efforts find her, police said at the time
