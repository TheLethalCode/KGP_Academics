 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has completed its preparation for launching Dhaka-Kolkata train services from Pohela Boishakh, officials said Tuesday. Additional secretary of the communications ministry ATKM Ismail said that the two nations would pen a final agreement in Dhaka by April 11 to roll out the much-awaited services. Home secretary Abdul Karim, meanwhile, said the government was examining if Darshana station could be declared "rail port". Both officials spoke to reporters after a meeting at the home ministry that discussed security and immigration issues tied to the train services. Home affairs adviser MA Matin presided over the meeting, also attended by inspector general of police Noor Mohammad. The home secretary said Bangladesh completed all preparations for opening the service. "The cantonment station (in Dhaka) will deal with security and customs-related matters while Darshana station (in Kushtia) will handle the immigration procedure," he said. He said officials at Darshana station would take at best three hours to complete immigration procedures of 418 passengers from seven coaches. The officials will deal with the passengers of one coach at a time, he said. All facilities, including prayer rooms, toilet and trolleys, have been prepared for the convenience of the passengers, he said. Eight counters of the Special Branch have been installed to handle the immigration procedure, he said, adding that scanners and computers are already in place. The tourism ministry will present gifts to all passengers there, he said. But the government would take time to build "security cage" like Indian side. bdnews24.com/
