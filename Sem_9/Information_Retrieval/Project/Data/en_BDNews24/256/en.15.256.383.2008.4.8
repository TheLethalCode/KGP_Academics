 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British house prices fell in March at their sharpest pace since the recession of the early 1990s, the country's largest mortgage lender said on Tuesday, raising expectations that interest rates will fall this week. House prices fell 2.5 percent month-on-month in March, Halifax said, more than six times the drop analysts had predicted and the largest monthly drop since September 1992. That took the annual three-month rate of house price inflation down to 1.1 percent, less than half the expected level, and the average house price to 191,556 pounds ($380,700).

The average UK price has risen by 120,860 pounds during the past decade from 70,696 pounds to 191,556 pounds -- an increase of 171 percent." Last month, house prices fell 0.4 percent on the month, leaving them 4.2 percent higher in the previous three months compared with a year earlier, Halifax sa
