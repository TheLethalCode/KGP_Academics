<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actress Mischa Barton, who starred on television drama "The O.C.," has agreed to serve three years probation for drunken driving, allowing her to avoid jail and escape a charge for marijuana possession, according to a report on People.com. The celebrity news Web site cited an unnamed source as saying Barton will plead no contest, which is similar to a guilty plea, pay a small fine and attend three months of an alcohol education class. One charge of marijuana possession will be dropped and another charge of driving without a license will be reduced to a traffic violation, according to People.com. The plea is expected to be entered at an arraignment set for Thursday. Barton, 22, was arrested in the Los Angeles area in the early morning hours of Dec. 27 after being stopped by police, who said her car was straddling two lanes of traffic while being driven. Police said Barton also failed to signal when making a turn. The actress portrayed teenage beauty Marissa Cooper on "The O.C.," a drama about young people growing up in an affluent county south of Los Angeles. The show ended its run on US television in 2006, and the actress has several film projects scheduled to land in theaters later this year. A spokesman for Barton was not immediately available to comment
