 NEW YORK, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc, the largest US savings and loan, said on Tuesday it received a $7 billion capital injection from private equity firm TPG Inc and other investors. The thrift also said it expects to report a first-quarter loss of $1.1 billion, or $1.40 per share.
