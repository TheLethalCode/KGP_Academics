 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday, relinquishing this week's one-month peaks as negative US company earnings news and a weak UK housing survey cooled optimism that the worst of the credit crisis may be over. Aluminium producer Alcoa Inc said late on Monday its first-quarter profit halved from a year ago due to energy costs and the weak dollar, while US computer processor maker Advanced Micro Devices said it would cut 10 percent of its workforce after Q1 sales fell more than expected. A survey by UK mortgage lender Halifax on Tuesday showed British house prices fell a weaker-than-expected 2.5 percent in March, the biggest monthly drop since September 1992. As a result, investors shifted their focus back to economic fundamentals after pushing world stocks up every day since the new quarter began on the back of expectations that governments might help banks clean up credit-related problems.

"We have to brace for earnings ... and subprime problems are not over yet." Also souring the mood, New Zealand business confidence slumped to a 33-year low in the first quarter while Australian business conditions deteriorated to levels last seen in December 2002. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1 percent, while MSCI main world equity index fell 0.5 percent, having hit its highest since late February on Monday. Expectations that Group of Seven finance chiefs who meet in Washington this weekend might unveil a drastic plan to fix banks and markets had improved sentiment since last week. The dollar fell 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies while the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.5768 on expectations that the European Central Bank would keep a focus on inflation at this week's policy meeting. Sterling fell 0.5 percent to $1.9780 after the Halifax survey bolstered expectations that the Bank of England would cut interest rates this week. Emerging sovereign spreads widened 5 basis points while emerging stocks were down 0.8 percent. The June Bund future was up 18 ticks, suggesting renewed interest in safe haven government debt. Oil rose above $109 as Iran said it had started to set up advanced centrifuges at a uranium enrichment facility and on fears over diesel supply disruptions following a European refinery fire. US crude for May delivery rose 29 cents at $109.38 a barrel at 0753 GMT, after earlier hitting $109.64, less than 1 percent off a record high hit last mon
