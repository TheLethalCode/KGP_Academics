<TITLE> Turkish AK Party sends free speech bill to parliament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ankara, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's ruling AK Party submitted to parliament on Monday a long-awaited revision to a law which has been criticised by the European Union for limiting free speech in the applicant country. The current article 301 of the Turkish penal code, which makes "insulting Turkishness" a crime, has been used to prosecute dozens of writers, including Nobel Literature Laureate Orhan Pamuk. The EU has said the free speech reform is a crucial test of the country's commitment to political reform. Ankara began EU membership negotiations in 2005. AK Party sources told reporters the draft amendment had been submitted to the office of the parliament speaker. It was not immediately clear when the general assembly, controlled by the AK Party, would vote on the bill. Senior government officials admit the current law has embarrassed Turkey's image abroad but reform has been delayed several times amid stiff opposition from nationalists. The AK Party leadership is currently meeting at party headquarters to discuss how to respond to a court case that seeks to close the ruling party for Islamist activities and ban 71 party officials, including the prime minister and the president, from politics for five years. The AK Party, which has its roots in political Islam, denies it is trying to undermine the separation of state and religion in secular Turkey. Details of the amendment to article 301 were not immediately available but the government has said the new article would have provisions that would stop nationalist prosecutors with their own political agenda from exploiting the law. The article has been used especially against writers such as Pamuk commenting on the massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-16. Turkey denies claims by Armenians and many Western historians that the killings constituted genocide.
