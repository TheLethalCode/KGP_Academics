<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday granted three months' interim bail to BNP's senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman in a case filed by the police under emergency powers rules. A High Court bench of Justice Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Emdadul Haque granted the bail on a prayer by Tarique, son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The court also issued a rule nisi on the government to explain within four weeks from now why Tarique would not be granted permanent bail in the case. Tarique was arrested in March 2007. The same year, the police filed a case with Kafrul Police Station against Tarique under the emergency powers rules alleging irregularities and corruption against him. The case alleged that Tarique had embezzled a huge amount of money through irregularities in biddings by different ministries, the import of CNG autorickshaws and appointments and transfers of government officials and bribery. The case also alleged that he had also earned a hefty amount of money through taking "commissions" on the setting-up power of plants and purchase of electric poles. Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan participated in the bail hearing on behalf of Tarique. In the hearing, the lawyer said: "Tarique Rahman was arrested a year ago. As per law in a case under emergency powers rules, a police report has to be submitted in two weeks from the filing of the case. But the report has not yet been submitted." bdnew
