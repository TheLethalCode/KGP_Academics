 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)The National Tax Lawyers Association (NTLA) Monday called for all political parties in the country to be brought under the tax net as part of a package of proposals aimed at increasing government revenue. "If the political parties are taxed the government will realise more revenue and transparency in the parties can also be ensured," the association's president Md Zakir Hossain said in a press conference at the National Press Club. "People will become more respectful towards democracy," he said. Zakir recommended expanding the range of tax collections in the upcoming budget, adding that the caretaker government's anticorruption drive should also be strengthened. The tax lawyers announced a series of tax recommendations at the press conference, which included mounting an investigation into the wealth statements of all former ministers, lawmakers, government officials and religious leaders. Zakir pointed to the "many religious leaders" who had become extremely wealthy in the country over recent years. "Measures should be taken to realise taxes properly from them," he said. Another recommended alteration to the nation's tax regime was increasing the number of individuals submitting their income tax returns through self assessment by 10 percent. Further proposals included taxing NGO officials, the introduction of asset tax and increased coordination between vat and income tax returns. The NTLA also advised banning NGO officials from political activism by forming a separate regulatory commission. bdnew
