 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares edged down on Tuesday as a revenue warning from French bank BNP Paribas underlined banking sector worries and a bearish earnings update from AMD hurt technology stocks. By 1045 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.2 percent at 1,313.24 points. The index has risen 4 percent so far this month with investors hoping that the worst of a bank sector crisis was over. The DJ Stoxx European banking sector index fell 1.7 percent, led lower by comments from BNP Paribas's chief executive Baudouin Prot, who said the bank may not match last year's investment banking revenues as the trading environment was "very adverse". BNP fell 1.9 percent, while French peer Societe Generale lost 2.6 percent, Deutsche Bank fell 0.8 percent and Santander slipped 1.7 percent. British banks were additionally pressured by data from mortgage lender Halifax that said house prices had fallen 2.5 percent in March -- the biggest monthly drop since September 1992, when Britain was emerging from a recession. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays were both down 3 percent while HBOS lost 2.5 percent. "It's still looking very jittery at the moment. We've had the banking problems wane away a little bit but there's still uncertaintiy surrounding the sector... now that the dust has settled and the rally's over," said James Hughes, market analyst at CMC Markets. Late on Monday, U.S. tech firm Advanced Micro Devices Inc, the second-largest maker of computer processors, gave a first-quarter revenue estimate below forecasts and announced plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce in a signal that the sector was not immune from the global credit crisis. German chipmaker Infineon slid 6.3 percent, while chip equipment maker ASML lost nearly 6 percent. Also weighing on the tech sector, Dutch navigation device producer TomTom hit a 32-month low and was languishing down 10 percent after it lowered its 2008 revenue outlook. "They're fresh fears. Going back a few months there was talk the tech stocks would be the only ones avoiding the subprime crisis ... the U.S. tech stocks have put the fear in the market and that's had a knock-on effect," Hughes said. German bank Deutsche Borse slid 6 percent, with traders attributing the slide partly to a surge in volumes reported by an alternative trading platform, Chi-X. U.S. DATA EYED Investors will closely watch US pending home sales data for February at 1400 GMT for further signs of the extent of the economic downturn in the world's biggest economy. Analysts forecast the figures will show a 0.7 percent drop for February, according to Reuters Estimates. "They'll obviously be closely watched -- any figure away from expectation, investors tend to grab onto and the moves will be exaggerated," said CMC's Hughes. The minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 18 meeting are expected at 1800 GMT, and may provide clues as to whether and by how much the Fed, which has cut rates by 200 basis points this year, will continue to reduce borrowing costs. The DJ Stoxx basic resources index fell 2.5 percent as metal prices weakened. Miner Rio Tinto losing 2 percent after it said it was still dismissive of the $135 billion all-stock hostile takeover bid by BHP Billiton. BHP shares lost 1.7 percent. Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index slipped 0.9 percent, Germany's DAX index lost 1.2 percent and Frances CAC 40 dropped 1 percen
