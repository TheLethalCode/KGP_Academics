<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Embattled Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi accused his predecessor on Sunday of misusing his political strength and endangering the ruling party. Mahathir Mohamad, who ruled Malaysia for 22 years before stepping down in 2003, has called for Abdullah to resign after his ruling coalition suffered the worst election setback in its history last month. Abdullah's National Front, or Barisan Nasional, coalition lost five of the country's 13 states to the opposition, and secured just a simple majority in parliament. Abdullah has refused to step down and on Sunday made his strongest public criticism yet of Mahathir's attacks. "Dr Mahathir said he was strong, but he has misused that strength," Abdullah said, adding that Mahathir's volley of accusations risked destroying his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which leads the ruling coalition. Last week hundreds of UMNO supporters met in Kuala Lumpur to demand Abdullah resign over the election results. The calls have resignation have been led by Mahathir and his son, elected MP Mukhriz Mahathir. Party dissident Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah has offered to challenge him for the party presidency at the next general assembly, which is not due until December. Mahathir, 82, is still widely respected within the party. During the last two years, he has accused Abdullah, his handpicked successor, of lacking "guts", selling out Malaysian sovereignty and seeking advantages for his family. Abdullah dismissed Mahathir's charges that he had tried to limit freedom of the press and stifle criticism by party members, saying Mahathir's record was not blemish free. "Some of these allegations are totally baseless," he said. "Were there not restrictions during his administration?" During his tenure, Mahathir came down hard on dissent, jailing critics and clipping the wings of the judiciary. Mahathir said he was not hankering for power but had a right to his opinions, state news agency Bernama reported. "I don't intend to become UMNO president or the prime minister (again) but as a member of UMNO and a Malaysian citizen I have the right to voice my opinions," it quoted Mahathir telling reporters at a function in the capital.
