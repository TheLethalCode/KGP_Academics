<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)-President Iajuddin Ahmed emphasised the importance of English in higher education Monday, alongside the mother language. In his speech as chancellor at Dhaka University's 44th convocation, Iajuddin said: "Like many others I also personally want that our mother language has its place in academic activities of the universities." "At the same time considering globalisation and internationalism English has to be given emphasis in the arena of higher education." Iajuddin also stressed the need Monday for universities to support a knowledge-based society and nurture "knowledge-oriented individuals  who can expand their views outside the country too" in the present age of globalisation. The 44th Convocation of Dhaka University was held Monday marked by different programmes. The convocation procession, led by Iajuddin as chancellor of Dhaka University, started from Curzon Hall and ended at the university's central sports ground where the main ceremony took place. The university awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees this year to Language Movement veterans Abdul Matin and ANM Gaziul Haque. Addressing those who were receiving degrees, Iajuddin said: "Getting a certificate just in order to get a job should not be the ultimate aim of education." "The significance of this achievement is far reaching. I hope all will remain active and alert in discharging their responsibilities in their respective fields." The university's chancellor expressed concern at the increase of session jams in the public universities. He urged all concerned including national leaders, teachers and students, to find a way out of this problem. "In most public universities session jams, though not crippling, are a matter of concern. In this background the cost of education is increasing. The students are losing many precious years from their lives. A huge number of university work hours are also being wasted." "This has become a very important issue in the effort to build up a knowledge based society," the president said. Iajuddin said that although there may be no need for a code of conduct among public universities, some measures were needed there so that students' interests were not harmed or neglected. Alongside university authorities, students, teachers, and guardians should be involved in management of the universitiestheir views should be included in decision making processes, the president said. No university becomes famous for its chancellors or other officials, Iajuddin stressed: "The success and reputation of a university depends on the success of the teachers and students." "The works and research by its teachers expand the reputation of the university. The depth of knowledge of the students testifies to the quality of the university." He said at present the main task of universities was to nurture a knowledge-oriented individual. "Keeping an eye on the needs of our times, the university education system has to be overhauled so that individuals seeking higher education can expand their views outside the country tooand contribute to the development of knowledge and culture." Mentioning the glorious history of Dhaka University, the president said: "I hope the contribution of Dhaka University in the forward march of the nation would be even brighter in the future." The deans of the various faculties awarded degrees to 3,885 graduates and post-graduates at this year's convocation. Of these 2,042 were women and 1,843 men. Twenty-four received M Phil degrees, 29 PhD degrees and 52 students were given gold medals for outstanding results.
