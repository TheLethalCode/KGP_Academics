 LONDON, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police investigating the disappearance of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews have arrested a 32-year-old woman. The woman, who has not been named, was detained in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, on Sunday on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Nine-year-old Matthews' disappearance in February sparked a huge search before she was found safe and well 24 days later. Michael Donovan, the 39-year-old uncle of her stepfather, has been charged with abduction and imprisonment. He was taken to hospital on Sunday after a case of "serious self harm", a Ministry of Justice source said. He has since returned to Leeds prison. Matthews was discovered in the base of a bed at a house about a mile from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, after going missing following a school swimming trip. Two other members of her stepfather's family were released on police bail on Saturday pending further investigations. Media reports identified the pair as Amanda Hyett, 25, and Alice Meehan, 48, the sister and mother of Matthews' stepfather Craig Meehan. Hyett was held on suspicion of assisting an offender while Meehan was arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice. On Thursday, Craig Meehan, 22, was remanded in custody on charges of possessing indecent images of children. He has lived with Matthew's 32-year-old mother Karen for about five years. Shannon Matthews has not returned home since her rescue and remains in the care of social services
