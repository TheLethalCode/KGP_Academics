 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)BTRC chief Manzurul Alam on Sunday stressed the need for bringing the ICT sector under a single ministry to ease policy formulations and realise the sector's potential. Currently, the ICT sector falls under three separate ministries, namely post and telecommunications, science and technology and information. "Coordinated efforts are needed to chalk out the best policies to realise the full potential of the ICT sector," said the chairman of the telecoms regulator at a meeting of Better Business Forum. "For that, I believe the sector should be brought under a single umbrella or even a separate ministry," Alam said. The infrastructure workgroup meeting was designed to review the BBF's recommendations for infrastructure development of the ICT sector. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission would also suggest that parts of the government's taxation policy should be reviewed, Alam said. "For example, we think the Tk 800 duty on SIM cards used for mobile phones should be lowered." Alam told the meeting that the regulatory body is working to create a rural market for internet service providers (ISPs) by introducing internet telephony (IP phones) to rural areas. "BTRC in collaboration with ISPs is working on a draft policy on IP phones, which will very soon go for public consultancy." The initiative aims to spread internet facilities among the rural population as demand for telecommunications is now larger than the available access to internet in those areas, the BTRC chief said. A draft policy for WiMax connectivity will also go for public consultancy by the end of May, Alam said. "We hope to finalise all the formalities and introduce WiMax within six months," he added. Alam also spoke of government initiatives for launching its own telecoms satellite. "For that, Bangladesh needs an orbit and we have already asked the International Telecommunication Union for that." "The government aims to do this by private investments and we hope Bangladesh will be able to launch a satellite within two years," he said. The BTRC boss also said the regulatory body was looking for ways to reduce bandwidth charges. "But we depend solely on calculations and evaluations of the telecoms ministry and BTTB (Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board)." "A revised policy of BTTB in February has already lowered bandwidth charges by 40 percent, but we along with the business community want to lower them further," Alam said. The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman and head of BBF's infrastructure workgroup, Hossain Khaled, along with other officials of the related ministries, were present at the meeting. bdne
