 New Delhi, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will ease access for exports from the world's poorest countries, the prime minister said on Tuesday, as he opened a summit with African leaders with calls for fairer global economic and political representation. Hosting leaders from more than a dozen African nations as it tries to emerge from China's shadow on the continent, India is expected to offer its skills in low-cost services and industry in return for access to rich natural resources and food supplies. But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was clearly also eyeing political benefits, with India pursuing a seat on any expanded United Nations Security Council to match its growing economic clout in Asia and beyond. "No one understands better than India and Africa the imperative need for global institutions to reflect current realities and to build a more equitable global economy and polity," he told assembled heads of state and ministers. Among them was South African President Thabo Mbeki who told the summit India and Africa shared many challenges. "Our enemy is common. We both have poverty and underdevelopment," he said, echoing concerns raised by the African Union's top diplomat, Alpha Oumar Konare, over the threat posed by rapidly rising food prices. Singh said products to be covered under the new exports regime would include cotton, cocoa, aluminium and copper ores, ready-made garments, and non-industrial diamonds. "Under this scheme, India shall unilaterally provide preferential market access for exports from all the 50 least developed countries," Singh said at the inauguration of the first India-Africa summit, adding that 34 of them were in Africa. While China has invested in countries like Sudan, where human rights concerns have curbed interest from more cautious Western countries, India enjoys historic and cultural links to several eastern and southern African nations dating back to British colonial rule, which it hopes will help it catch up. BUILDING TRADE TIES India's trade with Africa has soared from $967 million in 1991 to $30 billion in 2007/08. But that compares unfavourably with China's trade relations with Africa which were worth less than India's in 1999, but have since leapt to $55 billion. Analysts say India has no reason to benchmark itself against China's state-driven progress in Africa, and it should not be alarmed by Beijing's presumed lead over New Delhi, which has private firms at the fore. "Instead, India has the opportunity to develop its own model for sustainable cooperation with Africa," diplomatic commentator C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper. Singh said that over the next 5 to 6 years, India would issue grants for projects in excess of $500 million, and that developing infrastructure in the areas of railways, information technology, telecoms, and power in Africa would be a priority. "The objective of our partnership is to cooperate with all the countries of Africa, within the limits of our capacities and capabilities, in the efforts towards achieving economic vibrancy, peace, stability and self-reliance," Singh said. "Towards this end, it is our intention to become a close partner in Africa's resurgence." India has extended lines of credit to African nations and trading groups worth $2.15 billion over the last five years, he said, adding this was expected to double to $5.4 billion over next five years. Energy ties will play a big part in the two-day summit with India looking to develop supplies for its fast-growing econo
