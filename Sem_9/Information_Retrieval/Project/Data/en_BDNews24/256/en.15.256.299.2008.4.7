 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed praised the armed forces Monday over their crucial role in national activities, saying the army had "brought the nation back on the right track". "The sincerity of the army is unquestionable in the maintenance of democracy, through transfer of power to the elected representatives and holding a free, fair and transparent election by December, 2008," the chief adviser said at an army function in Mymensingh. "The role of the Bangladesh Army is praiseworthy in maintenance of the country's law and order and bringing the nation back on the right track," he said, while addressing a flag raising programme of a new army training and doctrine command unit. The army had taken the nation towards 'a new path of enlightenment', Fakhruddin said, by supporting different activities of the government including curbing terrorism and clearing illegal dwellings and establishments. On the participation of the army in enrolling voters, he said: "The army has introduced a glorious new chapter by taking part in the crucial work of voter listing and national identity cards." He also recalled the relief and rehabilitation activities of the army last year in the wake of two consecutive floods and Cyclone Sidr. The government has constantly shown keen interest in the modernisation of the army, Fakhruddin said, adding: "The setting up of army training and doctrine commands is a part of that process." "The present government will show its sincerity in future, as it has in the past, to maintain its armed forces on a par with other countries of the world amid the limited resources it has," he said. bdnews24.c
