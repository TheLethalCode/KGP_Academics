<TITLE> Liverpool to take positive approach against Arsenal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LIVERPOOL, England, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool will avoid the temptation to secure Champions League progress on the away goals rule in their quarter-final second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday, manager Rafael Benitez said. A 1-1 draw at the Emirates stadium last Wednesday means Liverpool would reach the last four if the game at Anfield finishes goalless. "We don't want a 0-0 draw," Benitez told a press conference on Monday. "I would prefer us to win. For us it is important to score a goal if we want to win the game. "Arsenal can score goals away from home so we have to think about winning the game." The match will be the third time the two teams have met in seven days with Saturday's Premier League clash in London also finishing in a 1-1 draw. That result appeared to have put an end to Arsenal's Premier League hopes, but Manchester United's draw at Middlesbrough on Sunday has given Arsene Wenger's men renewed hope. Third-placed Arsenal are six points behind the leaders with five games left. Benitez does not expect Arsenal's focus to be on anything other than the Champions League on Tuesday. "I am sure Arsene Wenger thought the race for the title was over on Saturday, but now he will be thinking he has a chance in the league," added Benitez. "But this game will be the most important they will have if they want to win a trophy this season. "They will try hard to win this game because it will be very difficult for them in the Premier League." Injuries to key players means Wenger has been forced to rely heavily on key players like midfielder Cesc Fabregas in recent weeks, prompting concerns that Arsenal will arrive at Anfield in a tired condition. Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso said fatigue will not be a factor for Arsenal. "I don't know if they will be less fresh than us," he said. "It is such a big game that I think they will find motivation from somewhere else that will make them fresh enough to perform.
