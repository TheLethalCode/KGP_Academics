 NEW DELHI, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian cricket board has postponed a one-day series in Zimbabwe planned for June because of a tight schedule, secretary Niranjan Shah said on Tuesday. "We will have it after the IPL (Indian Premier League)," he told Reuters. "Or we'll try to fit it in at a later time. It is a minor thing." The series with three ODIs is part of the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Future Tours programme. India, currently hosting South Africa for a test series, have a packed schedule until early next year, starting with the 44-day IPL due to begin on April 18.

India will also feature in the Asia Cup in Pakistan from June 24-July 6 and then tour Sri Lank
