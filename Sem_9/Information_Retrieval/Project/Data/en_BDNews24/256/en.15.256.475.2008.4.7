 London, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Passengers at Britain's two busiest airports face fare rises over the next five years following a heavily criticised new price-control regime, which came into force this month. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), announced earlier this year that it would allow airport operator BAA to impose rises in landing charges at Heathrow and Gatwick until March 2013. Charges airlines have been paying at Heathrow over the last financial year are the equivalent of 10.36 pounds per passenger, but the CAA has allowed this figure to rise 23.5 percent in real terms to 12.80 pounds per passenger in 2008/09. The increase at Gatwick will be 21 percent to 6.79 pounds per passenger. Some of the increases are expected to be passed on to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices -- making it all the more important for consumers to get value for money when jetting off. Price aggregators -- Web sites that search the market at the click of a mouse -- can prove invaluable for hunting down the cheapest flights. Airline-network.co.uk, Cheapflights.co.uk and Flightsdirect.com give quotes from the world's leading airlines, while Kelkoo.co.uk and Lastminute.com also have travel channels. When it comes to footing the bill, there are two simple options: cash or credit. Most British savers are stashing cash for a holiday, according to Standard Life's saving and investment index. Some 47 percent of those saving are planning to spend the cash on a break away -- more than the 45 percent who are saving for retirement. However, scores of others borrow to meet the cost. Around 2.3 million holidaymakers take more than a year to pay off debts run up during their summer break, according to price comparison site MoneyExpert.com. On average, people borrowing to pay for their summer holiday take 3.8 months to clear the debt. "With so many of us struggling to balance the books at the moment there will be millions of holidaymakers who will turn to credit to make sure they can top up the tan," says Sean Gardner, chief executive of MoneyExpert.com. "If you can't save up and have to resort to borrowing for your holiday then it is critical that you get good value." Cheap credit is far harder to come by than it once was, but there are still some good 0 percent credit card deals around. HSBC Bank is currently offering an introductory interest-free period of 12 months, Halifax gives nine months, while Lloyds TSB, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have cards giving six months interest-free. Carrying the right card when on holiday is also imperative. British holidaymakers will be charged a total 686 million pounds for using their cards abroad this year, according to uSwitch.com. But charges between providers vary widely. Almost all plastic cards add a foreign exchange loading fee to the exchange rate, typically 2.75 percent, charged on both purchases and cash withdrawals. So, for every 100 pounds you spend, an extra 2.75 pounds will be charged. On top of this, credit cards invariably charge interest from the date of the transaction, even if you repay the balance in full by the minimum payment due date. A growing number of debit cards also charge fees per transaction -- whether in a shop or a cash withdrawal. Most providers charge 1.5 or 2 percent on cash transactions, while the Yorkshire Bank levies a charge of 3.5 percent. Frequent small withdrawals from a hole-in-the-wall abroad can prove far more costly than a couple of withdrawals for larger amounts. On retail transactions, Co-operative Bank charges customers 2.75 percent, while Coventry Building Society and Yorkshire Bank charge 2 percent. Halifax charges a flat rate of 1.50 pounds, NatWest and RBS charge 1.25 pounds and Lloyds TBS levies a one pound fee. Fee-free offerings are few and far between, but there are some. Nationwide Building Society is the only provider that does not levy any fees for overseas usage of debit or credit cards. The Post Office also has a credit card that does not levy foreign usage charges anywhere in the world. In the long-run, it might prove economical to have two separate credit cards -- one for UK use and one for overseas spending. "While credit and debit cards can be a convenient way to manage your holiday spending, they can also put a dent in your holiday budget if you're not careful," says Andrew Hagger, head of news and press at Moneyfacts.co.uk. "Using your card overseas can be a simple and hassle-free way to manage your money on holiday, and with Nationwide debit cards or the Nationwide or Post office credit cards, it can be cost-free too. "With any other cards you need to spend wisely, watch how and when you use your cards." Frequent travellers could also consider opening a Citibank foreign currency account to avoid commission and other charges. Customers whose debit cards are linked to a US dollar or Euro current account can make cash withdrawals from Citibank cash machines abroad and debit card purchases in those currencies for free. Pre-paid cards, loaded with the currency used in your holiday destination, are another option. Use of these cards is expected to rise by 600 percent to 50.5 billion pounds per year by 2010, according to TowerGroup. "An increase in the use of prepaid cards for foreign exchange is great for banks as well as the consumer," says Andrew Buller, director of travel money technology firm IMX Software. "As the card is prepaid, there is a limit to the amount that can be lost or stolen and the risk of ID theft is minimised as it's not linked to personal bank accounts." Be wary, too, of "dynamic currency conversion". This is a growing practice whereby overseas retailers convert the price of goods from the domestic currency into Sterling by using their own conversion rate. While some holidaymakers like to know exactly how much they will pay in pounds, in many cases this comes at a premium, so insist on paying in the local curren
