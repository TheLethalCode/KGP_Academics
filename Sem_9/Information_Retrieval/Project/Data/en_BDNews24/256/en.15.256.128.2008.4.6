<TEXT>
 Dhaka/Tangail, April 6 (bdnews24.com)Army chief Moeen U Ahmed has sought to ensure a last-minute presidential pardon for freedom fighter Rakhal Chandra Naha on the eve of his execution set for Monday night. "The army chief has taken the initiative for presidential pardon  as a gesture of honour for freedom fighters," the Inter-Service Public Relations Directorate said in a statement Sunday. Naha, a resident of Comilla, had been sentenced to death in 2003 over violent clashes in which his relative Dinesh Dutta died. Naha was sued for his alleged role in the death as he had a conflict with Dinesh. Comilla jail authorities are scheduled to execute Naha at 11.00pm Monday. Also at a rally of farmers in Tangail, General Moeen said he had requested the president to pardon Naha and the president assured him of clemency. "Rakhal Chandra is a freedom fighter. He fought for the country. Freedom fighters gave us the freedom we are now enjoying. He might have committed a crime, but he could be pardoned," the army chief said. bdnews2
