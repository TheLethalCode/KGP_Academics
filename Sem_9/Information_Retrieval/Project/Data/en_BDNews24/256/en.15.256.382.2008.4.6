 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Sunday approved the draft of an agreement between Dhaka and Kolkata on train services, scheduled to take off on April 14, a government spokesman said. The approval was announced by the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim in a press briefing after a cabinet meeting in the CA's office. Earlier, policymakers gave initial approval on Feb 24 to the proposal for launching the direct passenger train services between the two neighbouring countries, Bangladesh and India. According to the proposal, both Bangladesh and India "may construct box-type temporary fencing from zero point along the rail tracks of their respective territories" to ensure the security of passengers and the train services. In another decision, the cabinet Sunday sent an ordinance designed to form the Truth and Accountability Commission to the law ministry for further review. The cabinet discussed in detail the Voluntary Disclosure of Information Ordinance 2008 at the meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, Munaim said. The government had earlier formed a four-member committee to make a draft on the proposed commission. The committee had designed the structure and legal affairs of the commission, which would continue for one year initially. The committee had recommended naming the commission "Truth and Accountability Commission". The draft said any person can enjoy the facilities of the commission, but the persons who have already been accused in cases pending trial will not qualify. bdnews24.c
