 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)The International Turkish Hope School (ITHS) in a clarification made its position clear on the issue of increased tuition fees. The statement came following a bdnews24.com report on March 24 saying the ITHS had increased its tuition fees five-fold from the previous Tk 3,000 a month. Justifying the raise, the statement said the school undertakes humanitarian help to the needy by way of presenting Eid gifts to the poor, distribution of relief in flood-affected areas and full free studentship for financially insolvent students. The school said it supports 42 students whose tuition fees, accommodation, food, clothes and other related expenses are borne by the school authorities, and is looking to help more students needing financial support. The statement further said that the school makes efforts to send poor but brilliant students for higher studies abroad at its own cost. The school management also mentioned their donations to the army chief's and the chief adviser's funds for Sidr victims. ITHS said that for these diverse activities they need to raise fees, which it claimed were not high compared with similar schools charging $10,000-15,000 a year. The school calculated an expenditure of over Tk 77 crore for the 2007-08 academic year for different social and humanitarian activities, it said. bdnews
