 HONG KONG, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose 1.3 percent to a five-week closing high on Monday, led by financial and resource plays, and buoyed by a rally in Chinese stocks as investors shrugged off the biggest monthly fall in US jobs in five years. Shares in Zijin Mining Group, China's second-largest gold miner, soared 11.6 percent to HK$8.00 after it said it was launching a Shanghai initial public offer of shares that could raise roughly $1.4 billion. Other resource-related firms also rose as the weak dollar pushed commodity prices higher, with Jiangxi Copper jumping 4.2 percent to HK$16.40. The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.29 percent at 24,578.76, with a 3.7 percent gain in heavyweight China Mobile lifting the index over 121 points. The China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed mainland companies, or H shares, climbed 2.15 percent to 13,419.88, tracking a 4.45 percent jump in Shanghai's benchmark index. Mainboard turnover rose to HK$99.47 billion ($12.77 billion), up from HK$91.50 billion on Thursday. The market was closed for a holiday on Friday. "People are betting that the Chinese government is going to do something to stablise the market there," said Y.K. Chan, a strategist for Phillip Securities. "The positive sentiment in China helped Hong Kong. We might be doing better, but we are still far from the highs that we reached last year." Shanghai stocks jumped as that market's short-term technical outlook turned bullish following a month-long slide, but the Shanghai Composite Index remains 41 percent below a record peak hit last October. Hong Kong's stock market is 23 percent off its all-time high hit in October. The country's top coal exporter, China Shenhua, climbed 6.2 percent to HK$35.00. Chinese coal exports are set to rebound this month following a slump since February as miners compete against each other to cash in on high international spot prices. Chinese power company Datang Power climbed 5.9 percent to HK$4.99, and China Coal Energy Corp gained 5.2 percent to HK$15.68. Shares in Asia's top oil refiner, Sinopec, fell as much as 4.8 percent but clawed back those losses to end 2 percent higher at HK$7.62 despite its sharper-than-expected two-thirds decline in quarterly earnings. Citigroup said Sinopec's 2007 net profit of 56.5 billion yuan ($8.05 billion) was 7 percent below its forecast. And shares in rival PetroChina gained nearly 3.1 percent to HK$10.76. Ping An Insurance, China's No.2 life-insurer, soared over 5 percent to HK$66.35. The firm has set up a 20 billion yuan ($2.85 billion) private equity unit to invest in pre-initial public offering financing deals, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday. The news comes after Ping An finalised a deal to set up a global asset management partnership with Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis. Meanwhile, Ping An's larger rival, China Life, climbed roughly 3.4 percent to HK$30.60. But property play Sung Hung Kai dragged after recent run-ups, and slowing sales and softening prices, traders said. Its shared ended down 1.35 percent at HK$131.
