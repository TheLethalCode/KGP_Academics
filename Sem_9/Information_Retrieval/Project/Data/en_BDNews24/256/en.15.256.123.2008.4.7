<TITLE> Michael Page sees signs of recruiting slowdown </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK-based recruitment firm Michael Page International noted signs of a slowdown in financial sector recruiting caused by the credit crunch, sending its shares and those of rival Hays sharply lower. The credit crisis fallout has mainly hit banking recruitment, particularly in London and Tokyo, and other sectors which depend on the success of these key financial centres. Fears of how wide a potential recruitment slowdown might be knocked Page's shares as much as 10 percent. The international recruitment firm, which has around 150 offices in 25 countries, said all non-financial sectors were growing strongly around the world. But Page's CEO cautioned that he could not tell what would happen in the next year. "If they get caught in every area then we're all in trouble given they're exposed to every continent's GDP rather than just the UK," said broker Panmure Gordon analyst Paul Jones, who has a "buy" recommendation. The shares clawed back some ground to be down 4.6 percent at 291p by 1342 GMT after several brokers including Panmure Gordon (buy), Evolution (add), Cazenove (outperform) and Landsbanki (buy) left forecasts unchanged following a conference call. The moderated warning came after the firm, which specialises in high-margin professional and permanent staffing, reported record first-quarter profits on Monday 3.2 percent ahead of the consensus forecast, broker Collins Stewart said. "(The problems) are almost entirely confined to banks, which represent 10 percent of our clients," Chief Executive Steve Ingham told journalists on a conference call. "If you go around our regional offices like Manchester, Birmingham, Weybridge, which are offices with 80-100 people, it's business as usual. Whether I'll be saying that in six or 12 months time I can't tell you," he said. Michael Page's gross profit jumped 33 percent to a record 140.3 million pounds ($281 million) in the first quarter to March 31, 3.2 percent ahead of a 136 million pound consensus forecast, Collins Stewart said. FEARS VS EVIDENCE "The figures were very good," said Panmure's Jones. "But people are asking will things get any better than this?," he said in response to the share price fall. Profit-taking, following a 15 percent rise in the stock in the last two weeks, also contributed to the sharp fall, Evolution analyst Hector Forsythe said. "The reality is, they said on the conference call, nothing has changed in the last four weeks since they posted 2007 results," said Panmure's Jones. Fears earnings will fall in 2008 are being weighed against evidence from the first quarter suggesting business is holding up well, he said, making it difficult for analysts to call. Several brokers said fears of a slowdown are already built into the share price, which has halved since last summer. Michael Page's UK banking division has seen gross profits fall by "very, very low double (percentage) figures" in the first quarter compared to a year ago, Ingham said. Gross profit at its UK accounting and finance division, which includes banking, were just 1 percent lower than a year before. Ingham did not quantify this further or give historical figures in the call, one analyst said. Shares in recruiter Hays, which is scheduled to give a trading update on Thursday, fell 6.11 percent by 1343 GMT while smaller recruiter Robert Walters fell 4.07 percen
