<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at Real Mallorca in the Primera Liga on Saturday, extending their lead at the top to seven points. The champions rode their luck in the first half but took the lead just before the break through Wesley Sneijder. The game swung Mallorca's way after Sergio Ramos was sent off in the 65th minute and Borja Valero's stunning equaliser soon after had the visitors desperately hanging on at the end. "The sending off changed the game. Bearing that in mind, and the stage of the season we are at, a point is a good result," Real coach Bernd Schuster said. The leaders have 66 points with seven games left to play. On Sunday, second-placed Villarreal can close to within four points with a victory at Sevilla, while Barcelona, who are third on 58, host UEFA Cup quarter-finalists Getafe. Earlier, French striker Florent Sinama Pongolle scored the only goal as Recreativo Huelva won 1-0 at Osasuna. The former Liverpool player outpaced the home defence to score in the 37th minute, earning Recre three valuable points that dragged them out of the relegation places. They climbed to 16th in the standings one point short of their hosts in 14th. RAMOS OFF Mallorca had clearer chances in an open first half against their visitors from Madrid, having a goal harshly ruled out for a foul in the build up and a good shout for a penalty waved away just before halftime. By then the league leaders had scored. Dutch winger Arjen Robben dribbled into area and his low cross was pushed into the path of his compatriot Sneijder to score in the 43rd minute. The visitors looked relatively comfortable until Ramos picked up his second yellow card with 25 minutes to go. Former Real youth team player Valero grabbed the equaliser, running on to Juan Arango's deft touch to curl a shot into the top corner. Guiza rattled the bar with the goal gaping near the end but Mallorca were unable to complete what would have been their third victory over Schuster's side since the turn of the year
