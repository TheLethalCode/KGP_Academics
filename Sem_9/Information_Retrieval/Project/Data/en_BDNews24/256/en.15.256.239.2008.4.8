<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Tuesday that he had directed the secretaries of different ministries to work on a budget, focusing primarily on curbing poverty and creating jobs. At a news briefing after a pre-budget meeting with the top bureaucrats of 16 ministries and divisions, the adviser said the next budget would give priority to ways of more employment and poverty reduction. "The budget is not a mere balance sheet, but is directly tied to development, generation of employment adn poverty alleviation," Mirza Aziz said. "I have told the secretaries that formulation of a budget is not enough, its proper implementation is important," he added. "The main target of current 2007-08 budget was elimination of poverty and increasing employment. The budget for next fiscal year is being formulated with the same priorities." Speaking of implementation, the finance and planning adviser said: "For the current fiscal year's budget the power of the ministries has been increased to a great extent." "Now the approval of the finance ministry or higher authorities are not required for all work. Ministries and divisions themselves can take many decisions. So they will find it easier to implement the budget." Mirza Aziz said the secretaries in turn had made some recommendations to expedite the process. "They have asked for direct authorisation for ministries to buy or acquire land for project implementation." Secretaries of the ministries of agriculture, local government, rural development, education, health, primary and mass education, land, women and children affairs, communications among others attended the meeting. bdnews24.
