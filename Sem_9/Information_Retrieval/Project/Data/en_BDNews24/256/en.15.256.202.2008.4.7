 CARTAGENA, Colombia, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A vote in Congress this year on Colombia's trade deal is "imperative," a top US trade official said on Sunday as the Bush administration seeks to persuade Democrats to support the pact for a key ally. Democrats in the US Congress are still not convinced Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has done enough to address their concerns over violence against labor leaders caught up in the Andean country's four-decade-old conflict. US trade officials are expected to submit the agreement to Congress soon and trigger a 90-day deadline for the vote even as the Democratic leadership expresses skepticism. "Geopolitical implications and national security implications and quite frankly the economic implications ... we believe make it imperative that there be a vote this year," US Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters during a visit to Cartagena with a congressional delegation. Uribe, now in his second term, is a staunch Washington supporter in a region where left-wing leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Ecuador's Rafael Correa have opposed US free-market proposals for South America. Backed by billions of dollars in US aid, Uribe has sent troops to retake parts of the country once under the control of armed groups. Violence has ebbed and investment increased. But Democrats are still concerned about the influence of former illegal paramilitary commanders who disarmed under an agreement with Uribe. They say labor leaders are still killed at an alarming rate in Colombia. Six senior US officials wrote last week to the Democratic leadership describing how attacks on unionists had declined and said they planned to send the pact to Congress to assure a vote this year. But a submission date remains unclear. "It was signed 16 months ago, and the Colombia free trade agreement deserves a vote and deserves a vote now," Schwab said. In Miami, US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez declined to say when the White House intended to send the trade deal to Congress but added that the president had always said he would like a vote after lawmakers return from recess. "They're now back," Gutierrez told reporters at an annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank. "It's too important, there's too much at stake. This is more than just a free trade agreement. It's important for national security, it's important for hemispheric security and it's important for a really important ally." The Colombian trade deal has become fodder for the US presidential election with both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and rival Barack Obama opposing the accord. Colombia said on Saturday it had ended a contract with a lobbying firm headed by Mark Penn, a top aide to Clinton after he apologized for meeting with Colombian officials to advocate a trade deal she opposes
