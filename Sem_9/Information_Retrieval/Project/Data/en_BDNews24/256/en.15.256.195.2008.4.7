 Cairo, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition force, called on Egyptians on Monday to boycott local council elections due on Tuesday in protest at the disqualification of most of its candidates. In a paid advertisement in the daily newspaper al-Dustour, the Islamist movement said it was responding to the obstruction by the authorities of its attempts to take part. The authorities have disqualified all but a few dozen of about 7,000 candidates the Brotherhood wanted to field in the local elections, where 52,600 seats are at stake. "The Egyptian regime has practiced every kind of obstruction, starting by preventing nominations, detaining more than 900 members of the Muslim Brotherhood and ignoring all the court rulings issued in favour of registering those disqualified (candidates)," the statement said.

"The people of Egypt should be permitted to choose freely among competing candidates," said spokeswoman Dana Perino. The NDP is expected to win the vast majority of seats on the local councils, but it could face a challenge from strong independents with a local following in some areas. Some small opposition parties are also competing. The councils have little power but the Brotherhood would need to have at least 140 seats if it ever wanted to field an independent candidate for the Egyptian presidency. The government calls the Brotherhood a banned organisation but allows it to operate within limits. The movement won about one fifth of the seats in parliament in 2005, making it the de facto leading opposition group. Founded in 1928, it advocates turning Egypt into an Islamic state through the ballot bo
