 NAIROBI, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki cancelled a trip to India on Monday to try to finalise a deal on a power-sharing cabinet with his main rival after they failed to reach agreement at the weekend. The joint cabinet is the key part of an accord brokered in February to end the east African nation's worst political crisis -- a post-election spasm of riots and ethnic attacks that killed at least 1,200 people and displaced 300,000 more.

"We appeal to all Kenyans to be patient," Kibaki and Odinga said in a joint statement after a meeting on Sunday. Talks were due to resume later on Monday. Both sides have been under intense local and international pressure to break a month-long deadlock over the cabinet. On Thursday they said they had agreed on how to share 40 ministerial jobs, but bickering broke out immediately. Sources on both sides said most of the disagreement involved just a few ministerial posts. Each side will get 20. One post not in dispute is finance, which means current Finance Minister Amos Kimunya is likely to keep his job. The expectation of peace has seen markets rally. The local shilling currency has rebounded to levels not seen since the disputed Dec. 27 vote. In early trading on Monday it was valued at 61.85/62.05 to the dollar, little changed from Friday's levels. Traders said the current cabinet stalemate was having little impact. "I think the market has decided to put the politicians aside.
