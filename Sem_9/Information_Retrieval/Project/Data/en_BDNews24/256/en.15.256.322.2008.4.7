<TEXT>
 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)-Air pollution in Dhaka, the world's eighth biggest megacity by population, has again reached intolerable levels, say environmental and health experts. In the winter season from November to April the level of air pollution reaches several times higher than safe levels, seriously threatening public health, they say. Experts say increase in population, unplanned urbanisation and lack of proper enforcement of existing environmental laws are all contributing factors. Officials of the Directorate of Environment and the meteorological department say that since the ban on two-stroke engines in Dhaka, the level of air pollution in the city has again reached hazardous levels as the number of motor vehicles has increased rapidly in the last decade. An air quality management project undertaken by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department showed that due to the surge in the number of motor vehicles Dhaka is now facing serious air pollution. The number of motor vehicles registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) in the capital was 139,675 in 1995. In 2004, it stood at 351,778, with more than 21,000 motor vehicles registered on an average every year during that period. After 2006, the number of motor vehicles has increased annually by 16 per cent. Ten years ago the rate of increase was 7 per cent. Experts concerned said, as a result of this rapid rise, harmful gases like ozone, nitrogen oxide and sulpher oxide from vehicle emissions has accelerated the rate of pollution. BRTA chairman Sunil Kanti Bose told bdnews24.com that 100,000 (one lakh) motor vehicles ply the roads of Dhaka every day, and more than 40,000 in the second city Chittagong. "BRTA has taken measures to restrict fitness certificates and movement of older vehicles to prevent air pollution. Vehicles older than 20-25 years are not allowed on Dhaka roads," Sunil said. Recommendations have also been made to enforce such a measure in Chittagong, he added. Dhaka Shishu Hospital deputy director of medicine Dr Mahbubul Hasan told bdnews24.com that about 10 million (one crore) people in the country suffer from diseases of the respiratory tract "Of them a good number suffer due to air pollution," Dr Mahbubul added. Dr Mahbubul, a paediatrician, said children and pregnant women are being most affected by the high levels of air pollution. "Awareness has to be created and effective measures taken to prevent air pollution," said the doctor. Director of the air quality management project of the Directorate of Environment Dr Mohammad Nasiruddin said the level of air pollution was worse in Chittagong than in Dhaka. The Directorate of Environment and Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission in joint tests found that the levels of air pollution in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi cities were among the worst in the country. Deputy director of the air quality management project Kabir bin Anwar told bdnews24.com: "Steps are being taken to observe air quality round the clock and provide people information regarding this to raise awareness." bdnews
