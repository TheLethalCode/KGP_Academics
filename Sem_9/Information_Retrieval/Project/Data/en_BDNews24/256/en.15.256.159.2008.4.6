<TITLE> Protesters target Olympic torch relay in London </TITLE>

 London, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-China protesters tried to disrupt the Olympic torch relay when it began its London leg on Sunday. Police officers scuffled with a small group of protesters outside Wembley Stadium as the flame was carried on to a red double-decker bus in front of flag-waving spectators. Three people were arrested. Later, a protester tried to grab the torch but was wrestled to the ground by police. The 2008 Games take place in Beijing from Aug. 8 to 24. The next Summer Olympics are in London in 2012. Five times gold medallist Steve Redgrave started the torch's 31-mile (50-km) journey through the capital at Wembley. About 80 athletes and celebrities will carry the torch by foot, bike, boat and bus across the capital for eight hours. Police had been expecting up to 80,000 spectators to watch the relay but many may be deterred by unseasonal snow showers. Campaigners protesting against China's crackdown on pro-independence activists in Tibet plan to line the route and target Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Downing Street office. "It is deeply sad that the Chinese through their brutality in Tibet have contaminated the Olympic ideal," said parliamentarian Norman Baker, president of the Tibet Society, in a statement on the Free Tibet Campaign's website. Falun Gong and the Burma Campaign will also target the torch's relay. GREET FLAME Brown will greet the flame in Downing Street, despite calls from campaigners and politicians for him to boycott the relay. "It's wholly inappropriate that Gordon Brown is participating in this torch-bearing ceremony today," Nick Clegg, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, told BBC Television. Brown has said he will not boycott the Games and says the Dalai Lama -- Tibet's exiled spiritual leader -- has not called for a boycott. China's ambassador to London Fu Ying is expected to run a short distance with the torch near the Chinese embassy and could be another focus for protesters. Several British celebrities dropped out of the torch ceremony in a show of unity with Tibetan independence activists or to take a stand against China's human rights record. Chinese security forces have locked down Tibet and neighbouring provinces to quell anti-Chinese protests and riots that started in mid-March. Human rights groups say Chinese police have killed a number of protesters. Foreign journalists cannot travel to the troubled regions to verify the claims. Protesters are particularly incensed that the torch will be carried through Tibet by Chinese officials in June. The Free Tibet Campaign accuses Beijing of using the torch for its own propaganda purposes. The torch relay will end at Greenwich later on Sunday in the hands of Kelly Holmes, who won two gold middle-distance medals in the 2004 Games.
