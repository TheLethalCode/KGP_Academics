 NABLUS, West Bank, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank on Monday after a bus carrying Israeli settlers ran over and killed a Palestinian shepherd as he led his herd across a road. Sharid Shtayeh, 15, was riding his donkey when a passenger bus carrying Jewish settlers to the settlement of Elon Moreh slammed into his herd near the Palestinian village of Salem, killing him, his donkey and a number of sheep. An Israeli police spokesman confirmed the shepherd was killed in a road accident. An Israeli ambulance crew pronounced Shtayeh dead at the scene. The carcasses of the dead donkey and the sheep were strewn across the road. Residents of Salem, where Shatyeh lived, hurled stones at the bus passengers and Israeli soldiers had to fire into the air to disperse the angry crowd, local witnesses said. Ahmad Jabour, a member of Salem's local council, said the shepherd was the third Palestinian to be killed in the area by Israeli drivers during the last 12 months
