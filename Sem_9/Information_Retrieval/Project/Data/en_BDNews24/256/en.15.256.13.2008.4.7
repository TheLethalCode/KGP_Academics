 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Former president HM Ershad Monday expressed doubt about the national elections promised by the year-end. "It seems elections may not be held this year. But I believe the elections will be held early next year. Upazila polls may be held in November," Ershad, who heads Jatiya Party, told reporters after a party meeting at the JP chairman's office in Banani. Ershad said his party would tie up with "like-minded" political parties to contest the upcoming polls. The political situation and elections were the key issues on the meeting's agenda, said Ershad, who presided over the meeting. The JP leader expressed satisfaction over progress in voter listing. On the probable alliance with political parties, Ershad said the JP would not join hands with Jamaat-e-Islami. On dialogue between the government and the political parties, Ershad said the talks might be "something of a citizen charter". bdnew
