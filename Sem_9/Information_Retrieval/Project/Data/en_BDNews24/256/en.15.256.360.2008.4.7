 PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said his side's top order batting failure in the second innings had been to blame for Sunday's loss to West Indies, which tied the two-test series 1-1. West Indies reached the victory target of 253 with the loss of just four wickets but Jayawardene said it was Saturday's top order collapse when they slumped to 99 for six lost them the match, despite a century from Thilan Samaraweera. "After the first two days, we knew it was going to be a tough battle, it was pretty even. Then we lost four wickets pretty early in the second innings and that was probably where we went wrong," said Jayawardene. "Our openers got out early, we lost wickets to a couple of bad shots and we put ourselves under pressure but then Thilan (Samaraweera) and Chaminda (Vaas) batted really well and put us in a position where we could win the test match. "It gave us an opportunity but we let ourselves down in that first 10-15 overs - we knew on this wicket the harder ball is going to do a bit, we needed to make sure we didn't lose to many up front and then build a platform for our bowlers," he said. Many would have expected Sri Lanka to have put their hosts under more pressure on the fourth day on a wicket which offered plenty to the bowlers but a 157-run partnership between Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul guided them to a relatively comfortable win. "We would have taken 250 on this wicket, we knew it had a bit of something and we hoped to take four or five wickets early with the new ball - we took three but it wasn't enough, those guys batted really well to take control," said Jayawardene. "At three down we thought we had a chance but we knew that those two were the danger players and they batted really well, we had a few half-chances but couldn't get the breakthrough. "It happens, we played a pretty good test match, did well, credit to West Indies they played good cricket and came strong in this game and played really good cricket for four days and won the test match
