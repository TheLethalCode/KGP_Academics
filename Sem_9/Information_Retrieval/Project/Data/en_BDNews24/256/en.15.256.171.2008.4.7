 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com) - Sonargaon Cricketers began their campaign in the Premier Division's Relegation League with a convincing 80-run defeat to Kalabagan KC on the opening day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. Sonargaon, who became runners-up in their first appearance three years before, bundled Kalabagan KC out for 127 in 46.1 overs after scoring a modest 207 all out in 49.4 overs. Put in to bat first, Sonargaon found them in tatters with 64 for three before middle orders Sharifullah and Azaz Ahmed steadied the innings with 37 and 48 respectively. Mostafizur Rahman (21) and Elias Sunny (24) and Arman Hossain (19) helped Sonargaon put up a modest total on the board. In reply, Kalabagan were reduced to 32 for four in the face of fierce spell from M Azim (3/14) and never recovered the damage. Fariduddin (32), Briang Chandra Dey (27) and Jupiter Ghosh (27) produced some resistance in the middle, but that was not enough to see off Sonargaon, and they eventually folded at 127 all out with 3.5 overs to spare. Spinners duo Elias Sunny and Sharifullah chipped in with two wickets each for 11 and 33 respectively.
