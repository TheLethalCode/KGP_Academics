<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United ended the weekend three points clear of Chelsea with five Premier League games remaining after being held to a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened Middlesbrough on Sunday. United led through Cristiano Ronaldo but after two well-taken goals by Boro's record signing Afonso Alves either side of halftime, the champions needed an equaliser from Wayne Rooney 16 minutes from time. United lead the way with 77 points to the 74 of Chelsea, who won 2-0 at Manchester City on Saturday. Arsenal are third on 71 after drawing 1-1 with fourth-placed Liverpool. United, who have a far superior goal difference to the two other contenders, host Arsenal next weekend and still have to visit Chelsea. Middlesbrough are now four places and nine points clear of the relegation zone and should begin to relax. United started well and deserved their early lead. Ronaldo's 27th league goal this season was one of his simplest, tucking in a low Michael Carrick cross after Boro failed to clear a corner after 10 minutes. Boro settled and levelled in the 35th minute when Brazil striker Alves, signed from Heerenveen on the last day of the transfer window in January, scored his first goal for the club when he ran on to a long ball to finish with confidence. Alves, who scored 34 goals in 31 Dutch league games last season, then showed why Boro paid 12 million pounds ($24 million) for him, neatly finishing after another long ball caused problems for United, who sorely missed the injured Nemanja Vidic and lost his centre-back partner Rio Ferdinand during Sunday's game. United, though, also looked dangerous and levelled when Park Ji-sung crossed from the right for Rooney to snatch a point. "It was a fair result," United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. "There was a period in the second half when I had to re-arrange the back four and we could have lost two or three goals. But it's in the nature of our club to never give in, it's a marvellous quality and they proved it again today. "You also have to give credit to the opposition, I though they played very very well, it was a fantastic game of football. "We've got a point today, I looked upon this as a difficult fixture. They don't get big crowds here normally but when Manchester United and other big teams come it lifts them.
