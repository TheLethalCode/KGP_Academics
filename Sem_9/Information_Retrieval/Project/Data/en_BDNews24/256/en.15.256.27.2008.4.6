 KARACHI, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is confident his side will benefit from their hastily arranged tour of Pakistan, where they will play five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. The Bangladesh squad arrived in Karachi on Sunday, just two days ahead of the opening one-dayer in Lahore, with Australian Siddons saying his team was not under pressure to produce positive results. "Pakistan were looking for some competitive games and we are here," Siddons told a news conference. "Results don't matter that much to us, because we'll get a lot out of the series." Bangladesh stepped in as a late replacement to fill the void left by the cancellation of an Australia tour, which the prospective visitors called off last month due to security concerns. Siddons, however, said Bangladesh were looking for more consistency in the series. "It should be a good series and we are happy and excited to be in Pakistan. We have a good mix and some players have potential to be world class players," he said. "I am looking forward to next two or three years. We will be a good side by then. "Everyone says we are inconsistent but we would like to prove that wrong in this series." Also making the trip with the Bangladesh team was their South African physiotherapist Darryn Lifsun, who had indicated that he would not travel with the squad for the tour due to security concerns. "He was reluctant to travel with the team but the cricket board managed to convince him to change his mind," a touring team official said
