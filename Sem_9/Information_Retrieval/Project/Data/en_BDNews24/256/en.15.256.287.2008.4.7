<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday she would accept any legal prison sentence if the government could ensured that people could afford rice. "If I am served a jail sentence I will accept that gladly, providing the government can reduce the price of rice," Hasina said in the presence of reporters, while speaking to her lawyers in court. "During my term, the country was self-sufficient. Nobody was in want of anything then." "Now spiralling consumer prices have almost choked the nation. Hungry people are scuffling over rice and other staples," the former prime minister said. After appearing in the Special Judge's Court-1 Monday, for a hearing on charge framing in a graft case, Hasina sought permission from judge Md Firoz Alam to speak with her lawyers in court. The detained Awami League president once again expressed her doubts about the holding of parliamentary elections by December 2008. "The way the state of affairs appears to be, one may very much doubt the feasibility of holding elections by December," Hasina said. On the extension army chief Gen Moyeen U Ahmed's tenure, she said: "Let them extend their service tenures. Everything has an end, you see." bdnews24
