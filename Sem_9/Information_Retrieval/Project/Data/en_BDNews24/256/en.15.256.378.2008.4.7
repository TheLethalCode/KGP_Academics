 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Prof Muzaffer Ahmad Monday called for a national reconciliation to put an end to the conflict between political parties. "Whether one likes it or not, a decision must be made regarding the two detained party chiefs if one really wants to end the conflict," Prof Ahmad, president of civil-society outfit Shujan that promotes good governance, told a roundtable at the National Press Club. The roundtable, organised by the Media Initiative for Public Policy, was also attended by main political parties, civil-society groups and educationists. Prof Ahmad said issues relating to detained former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina should be given priority in the upcoming dialogue with the caretaker administration. "A political solution may end their detentions or help to cancel their cases. There are instances of such compromises," he said. Prof Ahmad said the political parties had to reach some kind of consensus before the national election, adding that the caretaker government, for its part, should lift the state of emergency. Prof Ahmad said he attached a great deal of importance to ensuring democracy within the political parties, and if the country failed to establish a better democracy now then nothing would have been achieved by the interim administration. Jatiya Party presidium member Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu, speaking at the dialogue, said: "We may hold different opinions at the individual level, but we must reach a consensus as far as national development and dialogue are concerned." Bablu endorsed the proposal of holding the local government elections before the national polls. Awami League leader Saber Hossain Chowdhury said the agenda for the upcoming dialogue should include the election schedule, power transfer and post-election responsibilities of the political parties. The AL leader added that the caretaker administration should "take political parties into its confidence". bdnews24.
