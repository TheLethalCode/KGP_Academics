<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman drove a van to an access road leading to Israel's parliament on Sunday and threatened to commit suicide by blowing up the vehicle, a police spokesman said. The incident was not related to a civil defence drill that began earlier in the day, spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. A child, believed to be the woman's daughter, was inside the vehicle, Rosenfeld said. "She claims she has a gas canister and said she wants to commit suicide," he said. "Police are on the scene, as well as a negotiation unit." Giora Pordes, the parliament's spokesman, said the van was near an outer barrier on an entry road to the Knesset, near Israel's Finance Ministry as well as other government buildings. There were no immediate plans to evacuate parliament or other institutions, officials said. The woman's identity was not immediately known. Israel Radio said she had threatened to kill herself unless authorities supplied a wheelchair to one of her children.
