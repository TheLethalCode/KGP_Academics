 Tokyo, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party backed on Tuesday the government's third pick for Bank of Japan governor, ending a stalemate that has left the world's second largest economy without a permanent central bank chief for three weeks in the midst of a global credit crisis. The agreement to keep acting governor Masaaki Shirakawa in the job, to be formally voted on in parliament on Wednesday, will end the first leadership vacuum at the top of the Bank of Japan in 80 years in time for him to attend a key meeting of G7 finance leaders in Washington on Friday. There, he is likely to join calls for action to ease the credit crisis, after warning on Tuesday the subprime housing crisis has so starved some US banks of capital that the time may come where the US government will have to step in. "First of all, it should be efforts by the private sector. But if the efforts by the private sector are not enough, a public capital fund injection, among various options, may become necessary," Shirakawa told a parliamentary hearing considering his BOJ candidacy. Executives from the main opposition Democratic Party, which with its allies controls parliament's upper house, agreed to elevate Shirakawa from deputy governor. That removed the threat of veto over the government's third nominee for the job, although its latest pick for deputy governor is likely to be voted down. MARKET RELIEF Financial markets are more focused on US economic problems than the BOJ leadership but analysts see Shirakawa, who won parliamentary approval last month to be deputy governor, as a realistic choice to end the three-week gap at the top of the BOJ. However there was frustration that a broader policy stalemate between the government and the opposition, due to the split control of parliament's two chambers, had been allowed to spill over into decisions on the central bank leadership. "Reaching a decision on the BOJ governor is not bad, but not being able to pick one for so long was inconceivable," said Naoki Iizuka, a senior economist at Mizuho Securities. Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga described Shirakawa, a career central banker, as a suitable replacement for former governor Toshihiko Fukui, who retired last month. "As acting governor, Mr. Shirakawa has effectively handled work as governor taking over from Mr. Fukui. He has deep knowledge and long experience of handling monetary policy," Nukaga told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Parliament's upper house is due to vote on Shirakawa at 0100 GMT on Wednesday, followed by a vote in the government-controlled lower house a couple of hours later. Shirakawa faces a delicate balancing act in his new job, with Japan's interest rates already near rock bottom at 0.5 percent but with some investors still expecting a rate cut this year. He told Tuesday's hearing there was a relatively high probability that Japan's economy would return to moderate growth, despite the threat of a U.S. recession and shaky global markets. "If you look at the biggest risk factor, which is strain in financial markets, the U.S. markets are going through the most serious turmoil since the 1930s," he said. "Under these circumstances, it is important for the BOJ to examine the probability of its scenario and carefully check upside and downside risks without preconceptions, and then to take necessary and appropriate policy action flexibly." Shirakawa has shrugged off labels such as hawk or dove, saying only that his views are not so different from those of the BOJ before his appointment as deputy governor. BUREAUCRATS VETOED The deadlock over the BOJ was prolonged by a row over whether senior finance ministry bureaucrats were suitable to lead the central bank. Twice the government put up former finance officials to be governor, only to see them vetoed by the opposition parties that hold a power of veto in the upper house. They argued having former government bureaucrats at the top of the BOJ would threaten its independence from the government when setting monetary policy. While the government changed tack with Shirakawa, a career central banker who had left the BOJ in 2006, it has put up another finance ministry official, Hiroshi Watanabe, as a deputy governor -- only to run into trouble again. Watanabe won the backing of some opposition party lawmakers because of his expertise in international finance, but was opposed by Democrats leader Ichiro Ozawa. "As a party, we have a basic stance that we will not allow retired bureaucrats to land cushy jobs," said Yukio Hatoyama, the secretary general of the Democrats. The end of the deadlock comes in the midst of a two-day BOJ policy meeting, with the central bank due to issue its decision on interest rates on Wednesday at around 0300 GMT. The BOJ is not expected to cut Japan's already very low interest rates but the outcome will be watched closely for any sign it has become more pessimistic about the econo
