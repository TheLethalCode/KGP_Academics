<TITLE> Solana urges EU pact with Serbia before polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brusseles, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged member states on Tuesday to make all efforts to allow the signing of a key agreement on closer ties with Serbia before elections in May. He told the European Parliament the EU must send a clear signal to the Serbian people to encourage pro-European forces in a May 11 parliamentary election, and this could be done by signing a long-stalled Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Netherlands and Belgium have blocked the signing, demanding first the arrest and transfer to a U.N. tribunal in the Hague of a key war crimes suspect believed to be hiding in Serbia. "All efforts should be made to see if we can finalise that (agreement) before May 10 and 11," Solana said. "We have to make all the efforts to extend our hand to the Serbian people." Anti-Western feeling has grown in Serbia since February's Western-backed secession of Kosovo, the Albanian-majority province under United Nations stewardship since 1999. Polls suggest a neck-and-neck election race between the pro-Western Democratic Party and the nationalist Radicals. A fragile coalition of the Democrats, led by Tadic, and the nationalists of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, collapsed in March over whether Serbia should pursue EU membership despite the bloc's backing of Kosovo's secession. EU foreign ministers, who see Serbian EU membership as vital to security in the Balkans, vowed 10 days ago to find ways to boost Serbia's pro-European camp ahead of the elections. "CREATIVE"? Even the Netherlands, which has vowed to block the signing of the SAA until Belgrade hands over former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic, said it would be "creative" in helping Serbia move closer to the EU. Solana said everyone in the European Union wanted to see Mladic in the Hague and the best way to ensure that was to encourage moderate forces over the ultranationalist Radicals led by Tomislav Nikolic, whom Tadic narrowly defeated in January. "At the end of the day, if Nikolic wins the elections we will never have that," Solana said. "The situation is exceptional and in an exceptional situation we have to be flexible ... I respect the other positions naturally, but I think it would be a good decision if we move on with the SAA." Diplomats say other EU ministers have put strong pressure on the Dutch and Belgians to lift their veto on signing the SAA. In recent weeks the EU has also dangled the prospect of visa-free travel for Serbs, as well as an interim deal on an SAA that was promptly rejected by Kostunica.

Diplomats in Vienna last week told Reuters Tehran was installing advanced enrichment centrifuges at Natanz in central Iran, accelerating activity that could give the Islamic state the means to make atom bombs in future if it chose to. "President Ahmadinejad has announced the start of the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges at Natanz," said state television. The announcement is a fresh snub to the U.N. Security Council, which since late 2006 has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Tehran for refusing to halt enrichment work. Iran says the sanctions, targeting its nuclear and military sectors as well as its financial transactions with the outside world, has not harmed the Islamic state. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear power plants or, if refined much more, explosive material for weapons. Centrifuges are machines that can spin compounds of uranium at supersonic speed to separate out and concentrate the most radioactive isotope of the element. Analysts believe Iran aims to gradually replace its start-up "P-1" centrifuge with "a new generation" it has adapted from a "P-2" design, obtained via black markets from the West and able to enrich uranium 2-3 times faster than its older counterpart. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany plan to meet in April to discuss whether to sweeten a 2006 offer incentives to pursuade Iran to curb its nuclear program, US officials said on Monday. Tehran has so far rejected any suggestion that it halt or limit its nuclear work in exchange for trade and other incentives, and says it will only negotiate with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agen
