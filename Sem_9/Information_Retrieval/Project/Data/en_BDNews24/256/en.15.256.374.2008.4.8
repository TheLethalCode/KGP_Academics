 London, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell early on Tuesday after hitting a 5-week closing high in the previous session, as banks were weighed by lingering concerns over the credit crisis and miners tracked metal prices lower. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Standard Chartered fell 1 to 3 percent after French bank BNP Paribas said worsening market volatility would make the company's promise of matching last year's revenues difficult. Sentiment towards the sector was also hit by a 2.5 percent fall in house prices in Britain in March, according to Halifax, the country's largest mortgage lender. By 0734 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 41.2 points, or 0.7 percent, at 5,973.6, after closing above the psychologically key 6,000-mark on Monday for the first time since Feb. 27. The UK benchmark index has risen 4.6 percent so far this month, but is still down 7.6 percent for the year. "What is it doing up at 5,980? I have no idea.

Buik said he expected the index to trade down towards 5,600 but believed politicians and central banks would act to counter the turmoil which would help boost the market by the end of the year. European stocks were also weaker in early session trading, while Asian shares sagged overnight and Wall Street was little changed. Miners also fell on weaker metal prices and after US aluminium producer Alcoa said its first-quarter profit halved from a year ago because of energy costs and the weak dollar. Kazakhmys lost 0.4 percent, Anglo American slipped 0.7 percent, Lonmin shed 1.5 percent, and Vedanta Resources dipped 1.1 percent. Rio Tinto said it was still dismissive of the $135 billion all-stock hostile takeover bid by BHP Billiton and that Rio was doing fine on its own. Rio and BHP eased 0.5 and 0.6 percent respectively. AstraZeneca dropped 1.3 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the drugmaker to "neutral" from "buy". The stock gained 14 percent last week after positive news about its Crestor drug and brokerage upgrades. Scottish & Southern Energy (SSE) slipped 1 percent after Britain's energy regulator said it had launched an investigation into SSE and Scottish Power following a complaint alleging abuse of dominant market positions. Tate & Lyle lost 1.5 percent after Credit Suisse downgraded its rating on the sugar maker to "neutral" from "outperfor
