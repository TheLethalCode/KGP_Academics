<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday stayed proceedings for two months in a graft case against Tarique Rahman's wife Zobaida Rahman, and her mother, for allegedly assisting her husband in amassing illegal wealth. A High Court bench comprising justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Emdadul Haque gave the order following a plea by Zobaida to the court on Monday to have the case quashed. The court also asked the caretaker government to explain within two weeks why the case should not be cancelled. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 26 last year with Kafrul Police Station against Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique, his wife and mother-in-law. Tarique is accused of amassing wealth worth Tk 4.81 crore beyond his known sources of income and concealing wealth-related information from the ACC. Zobaida and her mother Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu are also implicated in the case for allegedly abetting Tarique. The ACC pressed charges against the three on Mar 31. According to the case details, Zobaida aided her husband in his illegal earnings and also received two fixed deposits from her husband in this connection worth Tk 35 lakh. Advocate Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed and barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah appeared for the defence, while advocate Anisul Haque appeared on behalf of the ACC. "Zobaida's family is a reputed one, and owns assets worth hundreds of crores of taka," barrister Rafiqul told reporters following Tuesday's hearing. "The Tk 35 lakh fixed deposit receipts in her name were gifts from her mother, who had accumulated the amount by collecting house-rent," he added. ACC lawyer Anisul Haque claimed the explanation for the fixed deposit receipts was an invention. "The story presented in the court about the source of the Tk 35 lakh FDRs is fictitious, as the tenant in question said in his statement that he hadn't given Zobaida's mother that kind of money in rent," said Haque. "The plea has been concocted to legitimise Tarique's illegal wealth," he added. bdnew
