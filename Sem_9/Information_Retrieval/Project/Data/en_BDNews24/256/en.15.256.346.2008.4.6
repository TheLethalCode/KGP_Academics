<TITLE> BDR to open more rice outlets in Dhaka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Rifles will open 25 more outlets in the capital to sell rice at low prices, BDR director general Shakil Ahmed said Sunday. BDR is also considering increasing the sales of rice per head and contemplating a plan to introduce a card system on rice sales. After a meeting at the commerce ministry, the BDR DG told reporters that the per-head-rice sales might be increased to 8 kg from 5 kg now, so that a person does not have to buy rice every day. "We are thinking of introducing a card system so that a buyer cannot sell rice elsewhere. However, giving cards will take time. The matter is still at the primary stage. Sales activities and card distribution can go simultaneously," said major general Shakil. The BDR chief stopped short of saying that there is no food crisis in the country and added: "The stock is adequate, but prices are high." He said one lakh tonne of rice would reach the country in a month from India. "We want to use that shipment for OMS programme. Another three lakh tonnes will arrive in phases." Shakil blamed the rice-price hike on mill owners and the problem worsened after India had reset the prices several times. "Some people are buying more rice fearing a further rise in prices. The mill owners are not releasing rice to the market," he said. Currently, the BDR is operating 50 sales centres in the capital and another 200 across the country. bdnews24.
