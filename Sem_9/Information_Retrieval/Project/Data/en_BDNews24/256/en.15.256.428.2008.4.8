<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)Two days after his term as army chief was extended by another year, Gen Moeen U Ahmed sat over lunch with the country's leading editors at the army headquarters Tuesday to give an account of his and the army's role in national life. The general touched upon topics ranging from the upcoming polls to failed attempts to rein in prices and the army's role in assisting the poor and destitute. He blamed "the hoarding tendency of importers, buyers and sellers", as well last year's floods, Cyclone Sidr and the global economy for spiralling prices. He spoke of the support of the armed forces in tackling the food crisis, saying they had helped farm an extra 342,993 acres yielding an extra 22 lakh tonnes of rice for the upcoming boro harvest. Answering a query on speculation over the polls uncertainty, Moeen said: "Please wait until December 31. Why won't there be elections by December 31?" "This is the cut-off time and we must not miss the date," he said. "The roadmap is there and I don't see any deviation (from it)," the army chief said. But he pointed to some "minor problems". Moeen referred to the Election Commission, political parties, the government and people as the key players of the elections. The general was flanked by Major General Sina Ibn Jamali, chief of the general staff. bdnews2
