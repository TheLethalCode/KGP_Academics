 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)A meeting of the voter listing project Thursday decided to schedule April 11, 12 and 13 to allow the unregistered voters of Dhaka city a chance to sign up. The meeting's proceedings were signed Sunday by the voter listing project director, Brigadier General Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury. Those wishing to register will be required to provide adequate proof of identity. Shahadat said the registration conditions had been demanded to eliminate any possibility of fake votes being cast.

The required documents are: any certificate or passport establishing the candidate's age, copies of municipal tax payments, utility bills and receipts of house rents or the landlord's voter registration PIN or telephone number. "The conditions will vary from person to person," deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com Monday. An Election Commission circular floated Thursday said voter registration had been carried out in the Dhaka City Corporation area from Dec 1 to Feb 29. A further batch of voters was registered in March. The draft voter list will be published following completion of the upcoming April batch.
