 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet is set to approve a police reform proposal for the modernisation of the department in its next meeting, the home adviser said Sunday. "The government is going to approve the police reform proposal as a part of reform activities done in different sectors to make the police department more transparent, multidimensional and modern," adviser MA Matin said, while inaugurating the Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence Week 2008 in Mirpur. The police force cannot maintain its current activities under the outdated Police Act of 1861, the adviser said. Speaking of the fire service and civil defence, Matin said the Executive Committee of National Economic Council had approved Tk 86 crore in funds to purchase modern machinery and equipment for the department to more effectively counter risks and losses from fire and earthquake. "The manpower of the department will also be increased," he added. Director general of the Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence, Brig Gen Abu Naeem Mohammad Shahidullah, said: "The larger buildings of Dhaka city should have fire fighting equipment. That will help us to take instant measures." "We are providing modern training to our divers to reduce the loss of life from river accidents," he said. bdnews2
