 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Five caretaker government advisers held an "informal meeting" with senior Awami League leaders at the Rail Bhaban Monday in the build-up to probable dialogue with political parties, participants of the meeting said. Updates with quotes The evening meeting that started at 6:15pm discussed preparation for the dialogue between political parties and the government and AL's demand for the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, an AL leader said, asking not to be named. Law adviser Hassan Ariff, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman represented the government. On the AL front, presidium members Tofail Ahmed and Motia Chowdhury, organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury and forest and environment affairs secretary Dr Hasan Mahmud attended the meeting. The leaders sat with the government representatives to fix a date for another informal meeting, now set for Wednesday. Asked to confirm the news of the meeting by bdnews24.com, the education adviser refused to make a specific comment but said: "We'll let you know later." But one adviser on condition of anonymity said they were "informally assigned to pursue some preparatory work". The adviser called it a "preparatory meeting" to launch dialogue with political parties. Asked if the meeting discussed the dialogue agenda, the adviser said: "Not at all." "You can say it was an ice-breaking, confidence-building exercise." Asked about a similar meeting with the BNP, the adviser told bdnews24.com that such meetings with all other parties would follow "very soon". Parties with representation in last parliament will be part of the process, said the adviser, adding in the same breath: "Some other parties may also be involved." The meeting came hours after four advisers sat among themselves on the government's standpoint and probable issues to discuss in dialogue with political parties. After the advisers' meeting in the morning, Hassan Ariff told reporters: "We have talked about the probable dialogue. We are going ahead positively." After the evening meeting, an AL leader who took part in the talks said they had discussed the "dialogue issue". "You can call it a pre-dialogue meeting," another AL leader who refused to be quoted told bdnews24.com by phone. The AL leader said the "formal dialogue" might be held in three weeks from now. bdnews24.c
