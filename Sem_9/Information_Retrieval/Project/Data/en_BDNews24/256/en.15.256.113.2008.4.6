<TEXT>
 Tangail, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, said Sunday the ongoing food crisis would end with the boro harvest as cultivation was high this season. Addressing a rally of farmers at Bhuapur Upazila in the district of Tangail, the army chief said there was no alternative to boosting agricultural output. "We won't be able to keep food prices under control just by importing. We have to make attempts to harvest two or three crops a year," he said. Asking the farmers not to leave an inch of land uncultivated, Moeen said: "We will all be working together for ourselves and for the country." He asked all to be cautious about corruption. Calling on the farmers' cooperation, he said Bangladesh was a country of potentials, which needed proper planning and leadership. "We want to carve a place as a middle-income country in the world by 2020," he added. Moeen had earlier inaugurated a corn harvest programme under army supervision on the banks of the Jamuna. He later distributed relief materials among 20 destitute families before he visited areas affected by river erosion. bdnews2
