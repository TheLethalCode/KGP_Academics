<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Users of BRAC Bank lockers, who had lost their valuables to a January heist, staged a demonstration at the bank's Dhanmondi branch Monday for compensation. The disgruntled clients claimed they were yet to receive any form of compensation after the bank's authorities promised to settle the matter. Bank authorities, however, say they will not be able to act until the case is dealt with in court. Abdur Rahim, a client of the bank who was affected by the robbery, told bdnews24.com: "We have given the matter this much time, but no more." "There is no alternative to initiating a movement now," he said. Rabet Khan, another locker subscriber affected by the heist, said following the incident the bank had issued letters promising compensation within 90 days. "That deadline expired on Monday. But the bank tried to fool us in another letter sent on April 3 in which they failed to mention when the compensation would be made. So, we rejected that letter," Khan said. He said the sit-in would continue until the bank issued a definitive statement on the matter, adding that, if necessary, they would consider widening their programme. Khan said they had finally managed to meet the bank's acting managing director, Kaiser Tamij Amin, after a two-month wait, but no concrete action was taken. Chief of BRAC Bank's marketing and corporate affairs department, Abedur Rahman Sikder, told bdnews24.com that the whole matter was now up to the court to decide. "We will have to wait for a court verdict when the case is cleared from the police station. After that, the bank will consider the matter," said Sikder. The robbery came to light on January 6 when the bank's Dhanmondi branch reopened after the weekend break. It was then discovered that a gang had bored its way into the bank's vault through the floor of the Hotel Nid Mahal, which occupies the upper floors of the same building. The gang broke open 75 lockers and looted valuables from 60 lockers. Detective Branch police have so far arrested 23 suspects in connection with the robbery and recovered about 500 bhories of gold ornaments. bdnew
