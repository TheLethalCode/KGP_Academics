 PARIS, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The president of Argentina, the first lady of France and several senior French ministers joined thousands of protesters in Paris on Sunday to call on Colombian guerrillas to release their ailing hostage, Ingrid Betancourt. France has dispatched a medical mission to Colombia to try to get access to Betancourt, a French-Colombian citizen who has been held in the jungle for six years by the FARC, but the guerrillas have not yet given their blessing to the operation. Police estimated about 5,000 people gathered in central Paris to support Betancourt and her family, with 15 other demonstrations planned for towns and cities across France. "This has touched me enormously," Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy, told reporters. "Quite simply, Ingrid must be released as soon as possible. And I want to tell you that my husband won't give up on her." Argentine President Cristina Kirchner, who is in France for a two day visit, also joined the marchers. "This humanitarian cause must take precedence above all others," she said. Among the ministers on the streets were Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Justice Minister Rachida Dati and Human Rights Minister Rama Yade. "It is a race against time while she is still alive," Yade said. Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential candidate who was kidnapped while campaigning in 2002, is the highest profile hostage being held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. France has said she is very sick, suffering from hepatitis and other illnesses, and her son has warned that she will die within days unless she receives a blood transfusion. Although France says it has still not heard from the FARC about its medical mission, the non-governmental organisation supporting Betancourt said the operation was still valid. "Nothing is blocked or in any way on the wrong track," it said in a statement on Sunday.
