<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court decides Tuesday whether to scrap the case against Tarique Rahman's wife, Zobaida Rahman, allegedly assisting her husband in accumulating illegal wealth. The court exempted her from appearing in court in person Tuesday. Zobaida appeared before the court Monday to request the bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Emdadul Haque to cancel the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 26 last year with Kafrul Police Station against Tarique for obtaining wealth worth Tk 4.81 crore beyond his known sources of income and concealing wealth-related information from the ACC. Tarique's wife Zobaida and mother-in- law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu were also accused in the case for their alleged involvement. The ACC pressed charges on Mar 31. Advocate Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed and barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah stood as defence counsels for Zobaida in Monday's hearing, Mahbubuddin arguing that the charges against his client were false and baseless. In a separate development, the ACC Monday applied to the Appellate Division chamber judge to freeze an earlier HC order that stayed the case proceedings against Tarique. The judge passed the application on for a full bench hearing on Apr 15. The High Court stayed the case proceedings of the case on Oct 1 last year. The Appellate Division on Oct 4 halted the HC ruling for three weeks and ordered the ACC to file a regular appeal against the stay order. But the ACC failed to file the appeal within that time. bdne
