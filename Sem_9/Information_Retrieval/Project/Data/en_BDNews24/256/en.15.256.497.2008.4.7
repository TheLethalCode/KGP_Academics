 Tehran, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran on Monday ruled out halting or limiting sensitive nuclear work in exchange for trade and other incentives from major powers and instead suggested it may announce new developments in the programme this week. Iran marks its National Day of Nuclear Technology on April 8, an occasion President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used last year to proclaim industrial uranium enrichment capacity. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear power plants or, if refined much further, provide material for weapons. On Tuesday morning Ahmadinejad will visit Iran's key uranium enrichment plant, state radio said, without giving details. Japan's Kyodo news agency on Friday quoted Ahmadinejad as rejecting in an interview the reported new package of incentives and Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a weekly news conference on Monday: "Any incentive that calls for the suspension of enrichment or somehow undermines or limits the Iranian nation's nuclear rights ... is rejected by the Iranian government and is unacceptable." Ahmadinejad will on Tuesday evening attend an event in the capital Tehran to celebrate Iran's nuclear achievements. Diplomats in Vienna last week told Reuters Tehran was installing advanced enrichment centrifuges at the underground complex in central Iran, accelerating activity that could give it the future means to make atom bombs. Western powers suspect the Islamic state is seeking to build weapons under the cover of a civilian nuclear programme. Iran says it only wants to generate electricity, but has been hit by three rounds of U.N. sanctions for refusing to stop the drive. Asked about the centrifuges report, Hosseini said any news about the nuclear work will be announced on Tuesday. The permanent U.N. Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- and Germany in March said they were ready to enhance a 2006 offer of incentives if Iran would halt enrichment and negotiate with them. But Tehran says it will only negotiate with the United Nations atomic energy agency and dismisses any suspension talk. The package offered by major powers two years ago included help with building light water reactors and allowing the export of civilian airline parts to Iran and promoting Tehran's membership in the World Trade Organization. Analysts say U.N. and U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran since late 2006 over its nuclear programme are making foreign companies wary of investing in the country but that the impact is cushioned by windfall oil sales gains. The world's fourth-largest crude exporter says it earned $70 billion in the Iranian year that ended last month and that its economy shows annual growth of about six percent. But it is struggling to rein in double-digit inflati
