 Chittagong, April 8 (bdnews24.com) -- President Iajuddin Ahmed Tuesday told students to devote their energies to transforming the country into a middle-income nation within a decade, at the first convocation of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. "In this age of globalisation we will have to upgrade our knowledge and skills to an international standard to survive," said Iajuddin. The president stressed the need for long-term planning with a vision that stretched fifty or a hundred years into the future. "Engineers must develop far-sightedness in their thinking," he said. The convocation was held on the CUET playground, where the president, who is also chancellor of the institution, urged the postgraduates not to succumb to corruption. "Universities are the best institutions for nation building, where the all ways of self improvement are open," he said. The president welcomed the plan to open a petroleum, natural gas and mining engineering department in CUET, saying the department would play an important role in exploiting the natural resources of the Chittagong region. The president awarded University Gold Medals to seven students for their outstanding results at the ceremony. bdnews24.c
