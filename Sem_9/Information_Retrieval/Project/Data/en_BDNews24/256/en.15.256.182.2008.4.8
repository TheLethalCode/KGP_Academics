 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)Army chief Moeen U Ahmed stressed the need for the nation to consume potatoes alongside rice to alleviate the food crisis in a lunchtime meeting with leading editors at army headquarters Tuesday. As they sat over a menu that was itself dominated by potatoes, Moeen touched upon topics ranging from the army's role in national life to the upcoming polls and failed attempts to rein in prices. " Bhater pashe aloo protidin (potatoes alongside rice each day)" is the slogan the army chief has been spreading throughout the army, he says. "I have never said to eat potatoes instead of rice," Moeen clarified, adding that it was nevertheless crucial to supplement the national rice diet with potatoes at this time of food insecurity. "Each person in the army now consumes 113 grammes of potato a day," he said. He blamed "the hoarding tendency of importers, buyers and sellers", as well last year's floods, Cyclone Sidr and the global economy for the spiralling prices of essentials and rice in particular. He also spoke of the role of the armed forces in tackling the crisis, saying they had helped cultivate an extra 342,993 acres yielding an extra 22 lakh tonnes of rice for the upcoming boro harvest.
