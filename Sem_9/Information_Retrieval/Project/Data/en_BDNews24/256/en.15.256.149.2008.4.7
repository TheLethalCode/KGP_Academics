<TEXT>
 KARACHI, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry protesters hurled abuse at an ally of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and slapped him with a shoe as he came out of a provincial assembly dominated by the supporters of the late Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf has become increasingly isolated since his allies suffered defeat at the hands of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and other opponents in elections on Feb. 18. The anti-Musharraf parties have formed a coalition government in the centre and are in the process of forming governments in the four provinces. The PPP leads the government in Sindh, Bhutto's home province, but invited support from the pro-Musharraf Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), in a bid to placate old enmities. Television news channels showed a man using a shoe to beat Arbab Ghulam Rahim, a former chief minister of Sindh who belonged to another pro-Musharraf party, the Pakistan Muslim League, as he left the provincial assembly after being sworn in. Two women also shouted abuse at Rahim and brandished their shoes -- a particularly insulting gesture in South Asian culture. Rahim blamed PPP supporters, though the party denied its activists were involved. "My only guilt is that I have been the chief minister. And their problem is that they can't tolerate their opponents in power in Sindh. They talk of democracy, but don't follow it," Rahim later told Reuters. PPP leader Zulfiqar Mirza said the party had nothing to do with the treatment meted out to Rahim. PPP anger with the the pro-Musharraf parties intensified after Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack by unknown assassins on Dec.
