 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Deputy commissioners have been directed to help curb the price spiral of essential commodities and implement projects to ensure a social safety net for poor people, a top government official said Monday. At the same time, some of the problems faced by the DCs were instantly solved and some others were included in the proceedings of a conference of district administrators in Dhaka, which was cut short to three days from four. In a post-conference news briefing, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said the DCs had made some recommendations on which the government would take decisions later. Secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office Kazi Md Aminul Islam, home secretary Abdul Karim, establishment secretary Abdus Salam Khan and other senior officials of the government were present. Majumder said that 40 recommendations had come up in last year's conferenceof which 26 were implemented and the rest are on the course to implementation. "This year's recommendations have been noted. Steps will be taken to implement them," he added. Asked about a proposal to introduce a rationing system for government staff against a backdrop of escalating prices of essentials, the cabinet secretary said the meeting did not discuss any such proposal. On "eroding powers" of executive magistrates, including deputy commissioners after the separation of the judiciary from the executive, Majumder said the judiciary had been separated from the executive branch in many countries around the world. "But there was nothing of power reduction in it. If anything like that happened, the government would look into it," he said. On judicial magistrates' demand to conduct mobile courts, Majumder said that there is an ordinance for the mobile courts to work under. bdnew
