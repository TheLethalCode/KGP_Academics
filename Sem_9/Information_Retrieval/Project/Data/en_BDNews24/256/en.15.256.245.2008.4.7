<TEXT>
 London, April 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday to vote in a parliamentary election where all 299 seats in the National Assembly are up for grabs. Here is a look at the race: WHAT'S AT STAKE President Lee Myung-bak's conservative Grand National Party (GNP) is hoping to take control of parliament away from its left-of-centre opponents. Lee needs a GNP majority to push through his planned economic reforms of tax cuts and deregulation to free up business. It would also likely give him quick approval for a sweeping trade deal reached with the United States. Without a GNP majority, Lee is set for years of confrontation and legislative gridlock. THE NUMBERS GAME: Voters select MPs in 245 constituencies, with the remainder of the seats allotted by proportional representation. Projections made by South Korean newspapers say the GNP is expected to capture between 150 to 170 seats. MPs serve for four years. It is the first time in 20 years of democratic elections that the presidential and parliamentary terms have started at almost the same time. The president took office in February and the new assembly opens in late May. At present, the biggest party is the left-of-centre United Democratic Party with 136 seats. The GNP has 112 seats. ELECTION DAY OUTLINE Voting ends at 6 p.m. local time (0900 GMT). Voting age is 19 and the country has 37.79 million voters. Television networks usually report their projections for the seat allotment in parliament shortly after the voting stops. The National Election Commission usually declares winners for the races at about 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. (1700 GMT to 1800 GMT) The new parliament is seated on May 30. POLL NUMBERS The GNP is supported by 42 percent while the United Democratic Party has a support rate of 15 percent, according to a poll conducted by Gallup Korea. Voters said the main issues in the race are revitalising the economy and President Lee's plan to build a cross-country canal. RACES TO WATCH The former presidential nominee for the left-of-centre party Chung Dong-young is squaring off against one of the country's richest people, Chung Mong-joon, an heir of the Hyundai Group fortune, who is running for a seat in Seoul as the GNP nominee. The head of the United Democratic Party, Sohn Hak-kyu, is trying to defeat GNP incumbent Park Jin in a constituency in the heart of Seoul
