 HARARE, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition went to court on Sunday to try to force the release of presidential election results after President Robert Mugabe's party called for a delay and a recount. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai has won the vote and should be declared president, ending 28 years of uninterrupted rule by Mugabe. But no results have emerged from the vote eight days ago and state media said on Sunday the ruling ZANU-PF had asked the electoral commission to delay announcing the outcome pending a recount. The MDC said a recount would be illegal and the government was planning violence to stay in power. Mugabe suffered his first election defeat when ZANU-PF lost control of parliament in the March 29 elections. "Legally they have no right to ask for a recount, they have absolutely no footing to ask for a recount so what they are trying to do is illegal," said MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti. "It's madness literally and metaphorically". After two delays since Saturday, the High Court began hearing an application by MDC lawyers to force the electoral commission to release the outcome of the vote. ZANU-PF's request for a recount and results delay is part of Mugabe's strategy to stay in power despite the biggest setback of his rule. The strategy includes legal challenges against some of the parliamentary results and deployment of pro-government militias before a possible runoff. Electoral rules say this must be held three weeks after the release of results, meaning the longer the delay the more time Mugabe has to regroup. WAR On Saturday, Tsvangirai accused the 84-year-old former guerrilla leader of "preparing a war on the people". ZANU-PF and independent monitors' projections show Tsvangirai being forced into a presidential runoff after failing to win an absolute majority in the vote. A group of militant liberation war veterans, often used as political shock troops by Mugabe, have re-emerged to back him. Zimbabwe state radio reported the war veterans had threatened to occupy all white farms in Masvingo Province after reports that their original owners were returning to land seized by the government after 2000. The re-emergence of the war veterans, who led a wave of violent occupations of white farms as part of a government land redistribution programme, increased fears Mugabe's supporters would try to intimidate opponents ahead of the run-off. The state-owned Sunday Mail said ZANU-PF had rejected an opposition offer to form a unity government. The MDC said it had made no approaches to the ruling party. "That's nonsense. That's absolutely nonsense, we won this election under extremely difficult circumstances. The only thing that worries us is the violence and the war that they have unleashed on the people of Zimbabwe," MDC spokesman Biti said. Former colonial ruler Britain and the United States, both of whom have applied sanctions on Mugabe and his top officials, have criticised the election delay and suggested it could be the precursor to a rigged result. Mugabe's government is widely accused in the West of stealing previous presidential and parliamentary elections, and his removal is regarded by Washington and London as necessary to rebuilding Zimbabwe's shattered economy. Zimbabweans are struggling with inflation of more than 100,000 percent -- the highest in the world -- mass unemployment and chronic shortages of meat, bread, fuel and other basic necessities.
