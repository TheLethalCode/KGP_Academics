<TITLE> Petition says appointment of ACC boss has no legal basis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)A writ petition, filed by BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury Sunday, questioned the legal basis of the overhauled Anticorruption Commission and the appointment of its chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and two commissioners. The petition was originally filed to seek a High Court move to scrap corruption cases against the BNP leader, filed by the ACC. The bench of Justice Iman Ali and Justice AFM Abdur Rahman will hear the petition Monday, which urges the HC to declare the appointments of the reformed ACC's commissioners illegal. The appeal also urges the High Court to declare approval for submitting a chargesheet in a corruption case against Chowdhury illegal. Nizamul Islam, a lawyer, filed the petition on behalf of Chowdhury. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq is expected to stand for Chowdhury. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, commissioners Md Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Monzur Mannan, cabinet secretary and commission secretary have been made respondents to the petition. The petition argues that the present commission has not been formed as per the ACC Act. In line with section 6 of the ACC Act, the president should appoint the ACC commissioners following the recommendations of a selection committee. Section 7 of the same law says the selection committee will be formed with two judges of Appellate and High Court divisions, comptroller and auditor general, chairman of the Public Service Commission and the immediate-past cabinet secretary. It says a selection committee was formed on May 10, 2004 led by Appellate Division judge MA Aziz for appointment of ACC commissioners. Following the recommendations of the committee, the ACC was formed with Justice Sultan Hossain Khan as chairman on Nov 30, 2004. Khan resigned on Feb 7, 2007. After that, there was no commission as per law, because the commissioners have not been appointed by forming a new selection committee. It says the selection committee that existed before Justice Aziz went into retirement does not exist now. Although there is a provision for appointment of commissioners through the selection committee it has not been followed, the writ petition says. The president appointed Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Monzur Mannan on Feb 22 last year, "violating law", it argues. bdnews24
