 Tangail, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com) A training jet of the Bangladesh Air Force crashed at Paharipara village in Ghatail upazila Tuesday, leaving its pilot dead, a military statement said. Critically injured squadron leader Morshed Hasan died at Dhaka's Combined Military Hospital after a rescue team recovered him from the accident site, said the statement of the Inter-Service Public Relations Directorate. The team carried him to the CMH by a helicopter. It said the accident occurred apparently due to technical faults in the F-7 jet. The statement said the accident occurred at 12:20 pm as the pilot was returning to Dhaka after practising firing at Rasulpur Firing Range near Madhupur forest. Immediately after the accident, local police sub-inspector Mehedi Hasan said by phone that the pilot died instantly after he fell on a tin-roof of a home at Paharipara. But there was no immediate confirmation from the military about the death. After hours of confusion, the ISPR statement confirmed that the pilot was dead. The ISPR said the pilot successfully ejected himself after he found the technical fault and used his parachute to reach the ground. But he fell on the tin-roof and was badly injured. The plane took off from Kurmitola airbase at 11:46 am, it said. Villager Mehedi Al Hasan said he rushed to the scene after hearing a big bang. The plane crashed into a banana plantation and its nose entered several feet into the ground, he said. It also caught fire after the accident, he said by phone from the scene. He had also earlier said that to him it seemed the pilot was dead immediately after the accident. Air Marshall SM Ziaur Rahman visited the scene and asked officials to carry on the rescue efforts, the ISPR said. A three-member probe committee has been formed to unearth the cause of the accident, it said. Morshed is originally a resident of Koyaria village in Madaripur district. He was commissioned in the air force on Dec 6, 19
