 Colombo, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka would not cut funds for the nation's vital infrastructure development, despite fighting a continued bloody civil war, the country's president said on Tuesday. President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is also finance minister said economic development and elimination of terrorism should be done simultaneously. "We will implement all the infrastructure projects to develop the country while successfully facing terrorism," Rajapaksa said after releasing the 2007 central bank annual report. "We will never take a step back on eliminating terrorism despite some people saying the economy is collapsing due to war," he said. A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber killed Sri Lanka's highways minister and at least 13 other people attending a marathon race near the capital on Sunday.

"The slow progress in the implementation of some planned infrastructure projects announced in the 10-year vision needs to be addressed as a matter of priority sooner rather than later," the central bank said. Inflation in Sri Lanka rose to a 17 year high of over 20 percent in 2007, before the central bank introduced a new index. The new inflation index in March was 17.7 percent. The central bank said it hoped to bring down inflation to 10-11 percent by the end of 2008, but said much depended on external global economic factors. It blamed soaring global oil prices and high food prices for the record high inflation. But the International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank says loose fiscal and monetary policy are behind high inflati
