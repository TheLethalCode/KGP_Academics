 PRAGUE, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has proposed delaying the activation of parts of its missile defence shield if Russia cooperates on the project, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Tuesday.

The Americans also offered to allow the Russians to maintain a presence at the Czech site, in order to promote transparency. But Gates said such an agreement would not be completed without Prague's approval.

Russia argues the system would be a threat to its security and has warned Washington and Europe against it. US negotiations are ongoing with both the Czech Republic and Poland.
