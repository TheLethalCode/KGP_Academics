 LONDON, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British student, described by prosecutors as a "wannabe suicide bomber", was jailed for eight years on Tuesday for possessing terrorism-related materials including bomb-making instructions. Mohammed Atif Siddique, 21, from central Scotland, was found guilty last month of possessing and distributing terrorist material via Web sites. He had argued he was only conducting research and was merely looking at Islamist terrorism material to find out "why young Muslim men like him act the way they do". "You told fellow college students that you intended to become a terrorist and one of your targets would be central Glasgow," judge Colin Carloway said. Siddique, born in Scotland to Pakistani immigrants, was detained and questioned by police at Glasgow Airport in April last year when about to fly to Pakistan with his uncle. His passport, tickets and laptop were confiscated. Eight days later, he was arrested in a dawn raid at his home. Evidence found in his possession and produced at his four-week trial included footage of Osama bin Laden urging holy war against the West, a video for recruiting suicide bombers, and computer materials on using weapons and explosives. His case is unrelated to the drama in June when a jeep laden with petrol canisters was rammed into Glasgow Airport. Siddique's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told reporters after the trial that his client had been "found guilty of doing what millions of young people do every day -- looking for answers on the Internet". Civil rights group Scotland Against Criminalising Communities said the case was a "travesty of justice". "Even under our Kafka-esque laws it makes no sense to call this young man a terrorist, and it is to be hoped that the argument will be taken successfully to the appeal court," the group said in a statement. In July, five British students were jailed for collecting a library of al Qaeda propaganda. They said they were doing research but detectives believed they had intended to travel to Afghanistan to fight coalition forces. In the same month, three other men were jailed after pleading guilty to inciting terrorism via Web sites which advocated killing non-Musli
