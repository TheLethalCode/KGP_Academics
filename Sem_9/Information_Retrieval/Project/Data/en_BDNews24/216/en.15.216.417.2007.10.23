 Abu Saeed Khan Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The recycled and refurbished handset business will be over $3.5 billion in 2007 and it will exceed $6 billion in 2010, announced New York-based ABI Research Monday. "Recycled and refurbished handsets can help mobile operators in improving per-customer profitability by allowing better management of subscriber acquisition costs," ABI's industry analyst Shailendra Pandey said. Shorter handset replacement periods, growing demand for low-cost handsets in the emerging markets and regulatory requirements are key drivers of the market for recycled and refurbished handsets, Pandey said citing ABI's report titled, 'Handset Recycling and Refurbishment.' "Operators can use these handsets to address low ARPU (average revenue per user) subscribers and start generating profits on low margin accounts quickly, rather than having to wait to recover subsidies on new handsets," he remarked. Mobile operators, retailers, recycling companies, handset vendors, charities and various take-back schemes is motivating more users to return their old and no longer used handsets for recycling, the study has found. Handsets for refurbishment are also becoming available in good numbers as more and more operators now accept handset returns for full refund, or new replacement, within 14 days or a month of purchase by the customers. These returned handsets, which are relatively new, are being refurbished for resale. ABI Research expects the market for recycled and refurbished handsets to grow steadily in the next five years, generating over $6 billion in revenue in 2012. Recycled and refurbished handsets can also make the second-hand mobile phone market stronger, more legitimate, and more reliable for buyers. As these handsets are properly tested and repaired by recycling companies, buyers can be surer of their reliability. Also, most of these handsets are provided with 90 days or sometimes with full one year warranty, similar to new handsets. ABI Research's new study, "Handset Recycling and Refurbishment," focuses on the growing market for recycled and refurbished handsets and the opportunities and challenges they create for handset vendors, mobile operators, recycling companies, and retailers. It discusses the high level business and marketing issues, and critical considerations for addressing the market. The report also provides detailed shipment and revenue forecasts for recycled and refurbished handsets as well as for ethical disposal of handsets from 2005 to 2012. bdn
