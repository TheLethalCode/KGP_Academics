 PARIS, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy should use his visit to Morocco to press for the arrest of five people wanted over the 1960s abduction of a Moroccan opposition leader in Paris, the family's lawyer said on Tuesday. A judicial source said on Monday a French judge was preparing warrants for five suspects linked to the disappearance of Mehdi Ben Barka outside a Paris cafe in October 1965. "These arrest warrants are a warning shot and I hope that they will make the Moroccan authorities act," Maurice Buttin, who has represented the Ben Barka family in the case for 42 years, told Reuters. "I don't just want these people to be arrested but for them to speak also." Sarkozy is on a three-day visit to Morocco during which agreements on a high-speed train, defence equipment and atomic power have been signed. "We want him (Sarkozy) to make the Moroccans understand that these letters rogatory must be carried out," Buttin said. A letter rogatory is a request from the legal authorities of one country for assistance from the judicial authorities of another. The French Justice Ministry said on Monday it was unaware of any such move by the judge, Patrick Ramael. Before any warrants can be acted upon they must first go before a French public prosecutor and then the Justice Ministry, which is responsible for transmitting them. Ramael's move came after Moroccan authorities failed to respond to a 2003 request for the five people to be questioned on his behalf. Despite extensive investigations by the Arab world's first truth commission, the fate of the charismatic Socialist Ben Barka is still shrouded in mystery. Some reports had him being whisked away in a French police car to a villa where he was tortured to death by Moroccan security officials. Another version had his body flown to Rabat, where his head was brought on a silver tray to the royal palace. Others said his body was dissolved in acid, with the help of U.S. and Israeli agents, and his head buried at a secret grave in Rabat. Moroccan government officials have vowed to shed light on the case but said they needed more cooperation from French authorities. No tangible progress has been made. King Mohammed set up an Equity and Reconciliation Commission to investigate rights abuses between the 1960s and King Hassan's death in 1999. The 21-month probe ended last year and confirmed at least 9,779 cases of rights abuses ranging from killings in detention to sexual abuses. However, it said more time was needed to investigate the case of Ben Barka, who taught mathematics to King Hassan before becoming the monarch's most feared political oppone
