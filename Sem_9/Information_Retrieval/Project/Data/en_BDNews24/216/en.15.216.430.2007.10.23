 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The verdict in an arms case against Lutfozzaman Babar, the former state minister for home affairs, has been set for Oct 30. Judge Syed Zahed Monsur of Dhaka Metropolitan Special Tribunal-9 fixed the date after taking testimonies from state and defence lawyers. On May 28, joint forces raided Babar's Gulshan home and recovered three licensed firearms and one unlicensed revolver with 25 rounds of unlicensed ammunition. Public prosecutor Md Kabir Hossain said: "The joint forces recovered an unlicensed revolver and 25 rounds of bullets from Babar's home. The accused must be handed down the severest punishment possible as the state has proved its case beyond doubt." Babar's lawyer, Abdullah Hasan Mahmud, termed the case 'false and fabricated'. During the course of the trial, 14 witnesses gave depositions against Babar. Sub-inspector Helal Uddin filed the case with Gushan Police Station. bdnew
