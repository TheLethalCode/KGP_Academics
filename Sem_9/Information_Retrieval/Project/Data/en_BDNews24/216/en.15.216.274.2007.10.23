 FAISALABAD, Pakistan, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move next year's Champions Trophy to October because it coincides with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board board, said he hoped the date of the tournament could be moved to avoid the month-long fast and minimise the risk of a decline in ticket sales. "Since the month of fasting Ramadan starts around Sept. 4 and continues for a month we want the ICC to hold the event from early October onwards," Naghmi told Reuters. Pakistan is hosting the trophy for the first time since its inception in 1998. Nagmi said a final agreement on the dates was yet to be reached because India, England, West Indies and New Zealand had already arranged tours during October 2008
