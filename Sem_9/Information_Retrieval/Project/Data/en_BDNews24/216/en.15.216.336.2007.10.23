 LISBON, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Airline pilots in Portugal went on strike on Tuesday affecting the country's biggest airline, TAP Air Portugal, and stranding thousands of passengers, a TAP spokesman said. About 500 pilots said they would strike on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday to protest against government plans to increase their retirement age to 65 from 60. Strikes are also scheduled for Nov. 5, 7 and 9. "There could be thousands of passengers affected by the strike," said TAP spokesman Antonio Monteiro. "We had been warning passengers to change their reservations since Friday." Monteiro said 12 flights had been grounded in the capital Lisbon, three in the northern city of Porto and two flights in Funchal, the capital of the Madeira islands. The strike on Tuesday began at 0300 GMT and will end at 1600 GMT. Transport minister Mario Lino called on the Civil Aviation Pilots' Union to call off the strike and said the government was open to negotiating. "I call on the union to have enough good sense to call off the strike, which is extremely prejudicial for TAP, the Portuguese economy and the image of the country," Lino was cited by Lusa news agency as saying on Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Pilots' Union is due to hold a news conference at 1400 G
