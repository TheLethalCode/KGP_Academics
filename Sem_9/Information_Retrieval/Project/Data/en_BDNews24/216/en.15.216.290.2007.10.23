 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks dipped Tuesday on profit-taking after the regulator had warned investors about price abnormality when the benchmark index and turnover Monday broke all records. The Securities and Exchange Commission Monday said the dizzy heights of DSE stocks were 'abnormal as many issues are overpriced and far outpace their fundamentals'. "Everything was there. Profit-taking and an SEC statement on current price level contributed to the correction. It's positive considering the present situation," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman and managing director of Imtiyaz Husain Securities. The main DGEN or general index was down 27.90 points or 0.96 percent to 2873.78. The DSI or all-share price index slumped 30.26 points or 1.23 percent to 2426.34.

Turnover on the bourse also dropped to Tk 2.86 billion from trading of 1, 91, 57, 855 shares. "Smart investor should sell to lock in profits. Unlimited profit expectation is one of the main enemies of the stock market," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance, a merchant bank.
