 KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-corruption body will charge 10 people, most of them civil servants, on Tuesday for misusing state funds in a crackdown dismissed by the opposition as inadequate. The arrests could be an indication that Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is reviving his moribund anti-corruption campaign ahead of widely expected early general elections.

Abdullah's campaign has also been handicapped by recent judicial criticism of the handling of some of the few high-profile cases that have reached court. Abdullah is due to visit the anti-corruption agency's headquarters on Wednesday for a briefing, his office said.
