 LONDON, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The group stage of the Champions League reaches the halfway point this week with Barcelona, Rangers, Manchester United and Arsenal looking to win their third successive matches in the competition on Tuesday. Something will have to give when Rangers meet Barcelona at Ibrox after both sides started with two wins from their opening Group E matches. The two clubs have not met before and Rangers's confidence will be high after their 3-0 win over Celtic in the Old Firm derby on Saturday. Barcelona lost in the Primera Liga for the first time this season when they went down 3-1 at Villarreal on Saturday. Rangers are unbeaten in eight Champions League matches while Barcelona have a poor record against Scottish clubs, with only two victories from 12 games. United, who beat Aston Villa 4-1 on Saturday to claim their ninth successive win in the Premier League and Champions League combined, travel to Ukraine to face a Dynamo Kiev side who have lost their two Group F matches and have gone nine games without a Champions League success. Arsenal, who host Slavia Prague in Group H, are looking for their 12th successive victory in all competitions. The Londoners have yet to concede a goal in four Champions League matches this season including a 5-0 aggregate win over Slavia's city rivals Sparta in the qualifying round. Elsewhere on Tuesday, VfB Stuttgart play Olympique Lyon in Group E, AS Roma meet Sporting Lisbon in Group F, CSKA Moscow play Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven face Fenerbahce in Group G while Sevilla play Steaua Bucharest in Group H
