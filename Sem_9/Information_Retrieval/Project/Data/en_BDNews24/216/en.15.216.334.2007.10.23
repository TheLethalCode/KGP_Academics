<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Tuesday said executive magistrates will be given temporary judicial power in some specific cases until the rules on separation of the judiciary were amended. Judicial power will be given to the executive magistrates in specific cases by amending the rules, he told reporters after a meeting. The executive magistrates would get judicial powers in some cases including maintaining law and order through summary trials, conducting anti-adulteration drives, eviction drives, visiting examination halls and conducting mobile courts as per the power under sections 260 to 265 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). "The executive magistrates have to do some works, but the amendment curbed these powers. Now to give them these powers the rules have to be amended. It requires time. So for the time being they are being given these powers temporarily. The rules will be amended later," Mainul said. "The separation of the judiciary from the executive is a new phenomenon. So there will be problems. Laws will be amended to remove the problems. "The laws will have to be amended time and again if necessary. The separation of judiciary is a continuous process. Work on the issue needs to continue after November 1," the adviser said, referring to the deadline for carving out a free judiciary. He said some decisions were taken at the meeting on the separation of the judiciary at the conference room of the law ministry. The cabinet secretary, law secretary, housing and public works secretary, acting secretary to the establishment ministry and additional secretary to the finance ministry were present. "Questions have been raised about the seniority of the executive officials who want to switch over to the judiciary. We have also discussed the issue. This discrepancy will be removed through discussion." A circular was issued on Jan 16 for absorbing the administration cadre officials in the judicial magistracy. It provided for a condition of satisfactory service experience of 8, 12 and 15 years in the administrative cadre for absorption as judicial magistrates and judicial metropolitan magistrates. The administration cadre demanded its change and making age limit for both the cadres. Sources said the inter-ministry meeting unanimously decided on removing the divergences. "There is a problem with sitting arrangements for the judicial magistrates in their offices. Those who are now working there have been directed to remove the problem. "The government will build new structures, if necessary, to remove the problem. But this requires time. For now, houses will be rented for judicial magistrates, if necessary," the adviser told reporters. Mainul said chaos could have arisen from freeing the judiciary but the task has been easier than any other time since there was a state of emergency and the joint forces and the army were assisting the government. bdnews24
