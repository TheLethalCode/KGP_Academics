<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The BNP's rival factions have both welcomed the government's move to separate the judiciary from the executive branch, saying the BNP had almost implemented judicial separation during its last term. "The interim government has completed an incomplete task and separated the judiciary from the executive," the party's expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said Tuesday. "This has satisfied people's long-standing demand for this. The BNP wants an independent and impartial judiciary," he said. Responding to the issue separately, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said: "The issue of separation was clearly stated in the constitution of 1972. Later, it was amended while Sheikh Mujib (independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) was in power." "In 1991, we took an initiative to separate the judiciary. Different laws have been amended in this regard after the 2001 polls." Delwar said a free judiciary would ensure justice and people's basic rights. "That's why we want a free judiciary," Delwar added. Bhuiyan congratulated the government on its commitment to the separation of the judiciary and said, "A lot was done in this regard while BNP was in power. We formed a cabinet committee to look into the separation of judiciary. The separation of judiciary is constitutionally recognised." Bhuiyan said that protests by some administrative cadre officials was not right and that they should abide by the Supreme Court's decision. But he asked the government to consider administrative officials' status and wages. Bhuiyan said he wanted a united BNP: "Unity will strengthen the party and reforms are needed to make the party acceptable to the people." Delwar, commenting on the BNP's condition, told reporters: "The BNP is strong. It is one of the largest political parties. The party is united under Khaleda Zia's leadership. We will welcome anyone who wants to make this unity more firm." He said the door was open for those who left the party. According to the party charter anyone can return to the party, he added. The general secretary said the party forum would decide whether to attend talks with the Election Commission after an invitation is received. "We are waiting for the invitation," Delwar said. About 100 members of Jubo Dal, the party's youth wing, led by their general secretary Moazzem Hossain Alal congratulated Delwar after the press briefing. They invited the general secretary to the Jubo Dal's 27th anniversary ceremony. Delwar asked party members to stay united and said they would take political steps to secure detained party leader Khaleda Zia's freedom after the ban on politics is lifted. bdnews24.com
