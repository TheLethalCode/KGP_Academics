 MADRID, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid have opened disciplinary proceedings against Robinho and Julio Baptista following their late return from international duty with Brazil last week. "The board of directors are determined to speed up the enquiry and make their decision on the case as soon as possible," the club said in a statement on their Web site (www.realmadrid.com). Spanish media reported that the players would be handed a heavy fine as stipulated in the club's code of conduct. The two players failed to warn the club that they would miss training last Friday ahead of the team's league match against Espanyol after their flight from Brazil was delayed. They were both left out of the squad for Saturday's match, which Real lost 2-1. Robinho was one of the Brazil players reported to have been partying into the early hours of Thursday morning following their team's 5-0 victory over Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro
