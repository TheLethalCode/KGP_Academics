 NEW DELHI, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Giant neighbour India has given an undertaking to do all it can to push for democracy in Myanmar, a UN envoy said on Tuesday, amid growing pressure on New Delhi to take a tough line against its military regime. Ibrahim Gambari is trying to forge a united front in Asia to prod the junta in the former Burma to end its crackdown on pro-democracy activists. But while he did not doubt India's commitment, he said countries could not be stopped from pursuing their own methods. "I am very encouraged by their response," Gambari said at the end of a two-day visit to New Delhi, part of an Asian tour to drum up support for action in Myanmar. "I am encouraged by the undertaking which they have given to do everything possible ... use their influence to encourage the authorities in Myanmar to continue their cooperation and to deliver tangible results," he told a news conference. New Delhi would spell out how it could help to get Myanmar's generals to free prisoners arrested during last month's pro-democracy rallies and make a process of national reconciliation inclusive, he said. "There are several issues that have been put on the table," Gambari said after talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee. "If all of us can club our efforts to get the government of Myanmar to continue to respond positively to that, then I think that will be very good," he said before heading to China. India, along with China, is considered to have some sway over the junta in Myanmar, which has kept a tight lid on the country since crushing Buddhist monk-led protests that began last month. The demonstrations grew into the biggest against the military regime in 20 years and official media said 10 people had died. Diplomats and pro-democracy activists, however, say the death toll could be much higher. Thousands more were beaten and arrested, although state media said last week that only 377 were still detained. LIMITED INFLUENCE? New Delhi has courted the military rulers since the early 1990s in a bid to counter Beijing's influence in Myanmar and access its rich gas reserves, in a turnaround of a policy that initially supported democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. India has come under significant pressure in recent weeks, including from U.S. President George W. Bush and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, to influence the junta to ease up on repression of protesters and open talks with Suu Kyi. But India has hedged its bets and played a delicate diplomatic game, calling for political reform while opposing sanctions and underlining that it would not help to openly condemn a neighbour. Indian analysts have been divided over whether New Delhi can afford to change its policy towards Myanmar while pursuing its economic and strategic interests. Most, however, agree that they do not expect any change to come about, if at all, due to Gambari's visit. Indian diplomats frequently say that the world overestimates New Delhi's influence over Myanmar's generals. Thant Myint-U, grandson of former UN Secretary-General U Thant from the then Burma, and who teaches history at Cambridge University, said he partly agreed with that assessment. "My guess is that outside influence may not be enough to move the regime forward on political reforms," he told the Hindu newspaper in an interview during a visit to New Delhi this week. "But it can help move the regime on other issues such as economic reforms and humanitarian issues. On some of these issues it has enough leverage to make a positive impact," he said referring to Ind
