<TITLE> EU proposes `blue card' for high-skilled migrants </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will propose on Tuesday a "blue card" to ease migration for highly skilled migrants to the 27-nation European Union. The scheme would give highly skilled migrants a fast-track procedure to get work permits and make it easier for them to work in another EU country or get long-term residency status, a draft text shows. To qualify for a blue card, a migrant would need an EU job contract of at least one year guaranteeing a salary at least three times the minimum wage in that country plus health insurance, the text shows.

The scheme must gain approval from all 27 member states and faces resistance in some countries, notably Germany. bd
