 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)- Taskforce members investigating the GATCO case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia Tuesday went to the Kamalapur Inland Container Depot and seized four files on transactions with GATCO. The members stayed at the ICD for about five hours from 10am and observed the activities of GATCO there. The taskforce, led by ACC deputy director Zahurul Huda, included joint income tax commissioner Shamimur Rahman, army officer Major Mostafa Kamal, CID inspector Nurul Islam and some other army personnel. The team first went to the administrative building and seized all files related to GATCO's transactions with Chittagong Port Authority, which date back to 2004. Later at 3pm, they entered the restricted area of the ICD and observed the activities of GATCO. In connection with the investigation of the same case, three members of the anticorruption taskforce including the investigation officer of the case Zahurul Huda on September 12 examined relevant papers at the Chittagong Port building. Zahurul Huda told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "We seized four files on transactions for the sake of proper investigation. We went inside the ICD to watch the GATCO activities." Kamalapur ICD deputy traffic manager Madhusudan Das told bdnews24.com, "The taskforce members, who had also come a few times before, checked and took away the files." He said, "They did not take away the files, but kept them with me so that normal activities are not hampered." ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury on Sept 2 filed the Gatco corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. Thirteen people, including Khaleda and son Arafat Rahman Coco, stand accused. The case details say a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 for appointing a contractor to Chittagong Port and Kamalapur ICD. The accused persons in collusion with each other landed GATCO the job though it did not meet the conditions of the bidding. The case alleged that the deal cost the government Tk 1,000 crore in losses. bdnews24.c
