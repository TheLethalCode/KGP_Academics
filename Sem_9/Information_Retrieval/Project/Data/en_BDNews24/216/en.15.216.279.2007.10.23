 BAGHDAD, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday for talks with Iraqi leaders in an effort to pressure the Iraqi government to take action against Kurdish rebels fighting Turkish troops. He is expected to meet Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari. Ankara has intensified pressure on US and Iraqi authorities to stop guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) from carrying out deadly attacks inside Turkey. The rebels killed at least 12 Turkish soldiers on Sunday and say they captured eight others.
