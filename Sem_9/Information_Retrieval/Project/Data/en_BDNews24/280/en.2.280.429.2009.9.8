<TITLE> Poor infrastucture stymies business: WEF </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com)Inadequate infrastructural support is stymieing businesses in Bangladesh, says a study by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Also known as the Davos Forum, the WEF in its Global Competitiveness Report 2009-10 also said corruption which was perceived as the most deterrent factor, has slipped down to second position. Private research firm the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) launched the study's Bangladeshi chapter, based on a survey of large companies, at a news briefing on Tuesday. "Inefficiency of government bureaucracy has ranked third while poor performance of the labor market also came as a major issue from the respondents of the survey," CPD official Khondaker Golam Moazzem said. Bangladesh has advanced five positions from the last year to reach the 106th position in WEF's Global Competitiveness Index. The study says the improvement was largely contributed by progress in macroeconomic stability in 2008 despite the global meltdown. "But infrastructure witnessed a considerable fall due to lack of improvement in various physical facilities especially, energy and power," said Moazzem, coordinator of the study. Most of the businessmen said poor electricity supply is the major concern and observed that general infrastructure remained largely underdeveloped, according to the report. The study highly acknowledged the freedom of press in 2008 but criticised the 'centralised' economic policy approach. "An urge to set up a strong and effective local government came up," added the CPD official. On governance issues, the respondents said no change occurred of government officials' attitude towards favouring firms and individuals in case of providing contracts. However, agricultural policy of the government has been much praised which seemed to maintain balance among different interest groups. No existing laws relating ICT also came up as a major concern and perceptions of the government having no clear implementation plan to use ICT for improving the country's business competitiveness emerged. On operational issues of business, formulation of a competition policy came up as a crying need. The report quotes half of the respondent businesses as saying that competition in the market was often obstructed by different anti-competitive practices in 2008. According to the study, businesses believe that government's efforts to combat corruption and bribery was somewhat unsuccessful in 2008 but threat of terrorism and organised crime impeding business operations was much low. A mixed reaction came from businessmen on the impact of the global economic crisis on Bangladesh. Half of the respondents said they believed different sectors would experience different degree of negative impact. However, 36 percent were indifferent about any impact while about 15 percent considered the crisis during 2009 to have some positive impact. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2009-2010, Bangladesh is expected to experience some degree of recession during 2009 and is more prone to recession compared to East, South East and South Asian countries. CPD's distinguished fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya, while summing up the report, said though Bangladesh came up in the ranking but still remains more or less in the bottom quarter. "We are relatively behind in almost all indicators compared with our major competing countries." Quoting the study, he said governance and public institutions performed better in 2008, which was the main contributor of Bangladesh's improvement in the global competitive index (GCI). "However, in 2008 the government's unnecessary expenditure was controlled, but development expenditure did not increase then," he said while replying to a query from the press.
