 Dhaka, Sept. 8 (bdnews24.com)  Developed countries must take the lead in mitigating climate change impacts, not only in their own interests but also for developing and transition economies, the United Nations says in a new report. UNCTAD's Trade and Development Report 2009, released Tuesday, also says governments across the world need to do more to tackle climate change impacts. The report argues that since developed nations "account for the largest share" of the accumulated greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and have greater economic, technological and administrative capacities for shifting rapidly to a low-carbon economy, they must act more responsibly. More mobilisation of fund is also needed, the report adds. While a country like Bangladesh, which experts say will be the worst affected by climate change impacts, argues for a global fund to help impoverished countries, the UNCTAD report also makes similar observation. Bangladesh in the recently concluded World Climate Conference-3 in Geneva pointed out that international community must come forward with compensation fund to help poorer countries mitigate impacts. "The international community would also need to mobilize additional financial resources, not only to help developing countries adapt to the consequences of climate change, but also to support their contribution to climate change mitigation," the new report says. . UNCTAD has also talked about efficient use of energy both in developing and developed nations. It said scientific research suggests that the humanitarian, social, and economic consequences of global warming, if unabated, will be dramatic, and the negative impact will be particularly strong in most developing countries. "There is considerable scope for developing economies in the years and decades ahead to gain from the opportunities that will emerge from the structural change towards renewable sources of energy, climate-friendly technologies, low-carbon equipment and appliances, and more sustainable modes of consumption", the report notes. UNCTAD Secretary-General Supachai Panitchpakdi regretted in the overview of the report that until today there had been insufficient investment in both public and private research for the development of alternative sources of energy and cleaner production methods. "Proactive policies are therefore needed, including subsidies and public acquisition of patents, to advance technological progress and accelerate the process of catching up from past underinvestment," Panitchpakdi said
