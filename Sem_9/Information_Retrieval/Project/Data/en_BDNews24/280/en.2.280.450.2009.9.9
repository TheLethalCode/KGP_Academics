 UNITED NATIONS, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Sri Lanka on Tuesday for revoking the work visa of a spokesman for the UN children's foundation UNICEF, whom Colombo accuses of spreading rebel propaganda. "The secretary-general strongly regrets the decision of the Sri Lankan government to expel Mr. James Elder, spokesman for UNICEF in Sri Lanka," UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters.

Sri Lanka has repeatedly denied that it committed multiple human rights violations during the final months of its war against the LTTE, who had retreated to a narrow strip of coast in northeastern Sri Lanka along with hundreds of thousands of civilians. Western and UN officials said the Sri Lankan army was using heavy artillery to shell the LTTE, even though it knew the rebels were using the innocent civilians trapped in the area as human shields. The army rejected the charge. UN officials say that thousands of civilians were killed during the last months of the
