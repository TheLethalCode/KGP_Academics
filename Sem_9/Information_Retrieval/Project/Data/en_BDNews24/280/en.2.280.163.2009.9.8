 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)The finance minister has said there will be separate laws to govern general banking and Islamic banking in Bangladesh. "A recent cabinet meeting in principle approved the draft amended insurance law," AMA Muhith told reporters on Tuesday after a meeting with the Bangladesh Insurance Association representatives at the Economic Relations Division office. "The standing committee related to the finance ministry is now looking at it closely and after review, the draft law will be presented in parliament for passage. "The draft mentions separate laws for governing the two insurance genresIslamic and general. Similarly, separate and dedicated legal regimes will be formulated and put in place." Muhith said it has not been right to merge Islamic banking and general banking, he said. Both banking systems are facing glitches while being administered under the uniform legal regime. Separate laws will be made to get rid of these anomalies, he reiterated. Asked if the amended insurance act will be approved in the current parliamentary session, the minister said, "The session is a very brief one, so, we'll have to see what all can be squeezed in." Bangladesh Insurance Association chairman Rafiqul Islam headed the insurers in the meeting. bd
