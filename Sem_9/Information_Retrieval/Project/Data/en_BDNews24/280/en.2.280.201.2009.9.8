 Natore, Sep 7 (bdnews24.com)Bank robbers reportedly made off with Tk 1.62 crore from a National Bank branch in Natore, cracking no less than 20 locks on the way and causing authorities to suspect an inside job, police said on Monday. Natore police arrested two security guards on suspicion of their involvement in the overnight robbery and also detained three bank officials for interrogation. Local authorities also formed a seven-member probe body headed by Sadar police assistant superintendent Moqbul Hossain. "The statements made by the bank officials are inconsistent and the true facts will come out in interrogation," Moqbul told reporters. Sadar police said cleaner 'Nantu' found a key to the main entrance lying outside the bank on Monday morning, and got no response from on-duty night guards after repeated calls. Later, police broke open the gate aided by the bank manager and other employees who found the strong room and vault unlocked. The bank manager reported Tk 1.62 crore missing from the vault, while bank papers and other valuables appeared intact. Natore additional police super Mojammel Hossain said five arrests were made after primary investigationsnight guards Abdul Kattab and Zulfikar Ali and bank officials Belal Uddin, Khondaker Shahadat Hossain and Rabiul Islam. On duty night guard Abdul Kattab said he went to buy paan at around 9pm on Sunday. "Some unknown youths treated me to a drink of Tiger beer and may have followed me back to the bank," he claimed. "Returning to my post, I lost consciousness and didn't wake up until I heard calls and shouts from outside the bank in the morning," he said. Additional police super Mojammel said, "It is not possible to commit such a major robbery without assistance of bank employees." "But nothing can be said for certain until investigation is complete." Police have called on the Rapid Action Battalion and Criminal Investigation Department to assist in investigations. Natore branch manager SM Jahirul Haq said, "I went home around iftar time after finishing my day's work." "Being called by the cleaner, I rushed to the bank where we found all the locks open and Tk 1.62 crore missing from the vault." Haq said he could not tell who might be involved in the incident. Asked why such a huge amount had been in the vault with a provision to keep a maximum Tk 50 lakh in the branch, he said, "There was a rush on the first banking day of the week, Sunday, and the amount could not be handed over to Sonali Bank in time." bdnews2
