 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)The low over the Bay and its adjacent regions has induced monsoons, leaving the seas choppy. The Met Office has asked the sea ports to hoist cautionary signal 3 and the river ports to keep cautionary signal 2 hoisted until further notice. "A low has been created in the north-western bay of Bengal and contiguous west coasts, which has whipped up the monsoons in the northern Bay and the Bangladesh coasts," said senior meteorologist Abdul Mannan to bdnews24.com on Tuesday. "The low may cause gusty to squally winds accompanied by rains in the coastal zone." Mannan said through the ongoing turbulent hours, Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and Mongla sea ports will keep warning signal number 3 hoisted and the south-western riverine ports including Dhaka will hoist warning signal 2. He also advised the fishing boats and trawlers to cruise close to the coasts. The senior weatherman said Wednesday might also see similar weather, which may well change into relatively calmer and natural autumnal weather on Thursday. The long-term weather forecast for September said, two to three seasonal lows may be brewed in the Bay through the period. bd
