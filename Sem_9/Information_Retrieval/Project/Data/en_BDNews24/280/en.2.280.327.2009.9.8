 Magura, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com)--A treason case has been filed on Tuesday against BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury at the chief magistrate's court of Magura. Enamul Haque Hirok, convener of Magura district Jubo League, the youth wing of the ruling Awami League, filed the case at midday. He filed the charges for Chowdhury's role against the interest of the nation during the war of independence in 1971 and his offensive statement about the murder of the nation's architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Nurul Islam filed the case on behalf of the plaintiff. Seven people have been made witnesses in the case. The plaintiff alleged that Chowdhury has been delivering indecent remarks about the war for long. Also, he is trying to destabilise the country by making defamatory remarks about the Aug 15 assaisination of Sheikh Mujib and embarrass the government, which is equivalent to treason. The judge, Sheikh Jalal Uddin, has ordered the officer-in-charge of the Sadar Police Station to take legal steps. bdnews2
