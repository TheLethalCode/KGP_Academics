 Natore, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com)  A security guard of Natore's National Bank branch, arrested after Tk 1.62 crore was stolen from the bank's vaults two nights ago, confessed his involvement with the robbery, police said on Tuesday. Sadar circle assistant superintendent of police Moqbul Hossain told bdnews24.com that they had launched an overnight operation to recover the looted money taking guard Zulfikar Ali with them after his confession during interrogation. They searched the home of Ali's relative, but came up empty-handed, said Moqbul. He said they were continuing to question several employees and officers of the bank detained after the robbery Sunday night. Bank robbers reportedly made off with the massive haul, cracking no less than 20 locks on the way and causing authorities to immediately suspect an inside job. Five arrests were made after primary investigationsnight guards Abdul Kattab and Zulfikar Ali and bank officials Belal Uddin, Khondaker Shahadat Hossain and Rabiul Islam. Moqbul said, "The arrested bank officers will remain in police custody for further interrogation." Branch manager Jahirul Haq, however, was free to go after questioning on Tuesday. Natore additional police super Mojammel Hossain said they were now more confident, following initial interrogations, that the bank's employees were involved in the incident. Investigators on Monday said a cleaner had initially raised the alarm, after finding a key to the main entrance lying outside the bank in the morning and getting no response from on-duty night guards after repeated calls. Police later broke open the gate aided by the bank manager and other employees who found the strong room and vault unlocked. The bank manager reported Tk 1.62 crore missing from the vault, while bank papers and other valuables appeared intact. Manager Jahirul Haq, asked why such a huge amount had been in the vault, with a provision to keep a maximum Tk 50 lakh in the branch, said, "There was a rush on the first banking day of the week, Sunday, and the amount could not be handed over to Sonali Bank in time." Additional police super Mojammel said, "It is not possible to commit such a major robbery without assistance of bank employees." "But nothing can be said for certain until investigation is complete." Police said they had called on the Rapid Action Battalion and Criminal Investigation Department to assist in investigations. bdnews24
