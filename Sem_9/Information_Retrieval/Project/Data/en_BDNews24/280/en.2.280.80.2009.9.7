 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)The UK government is to ensure that residents can have every opportunity to fill job vacancies before they are offered to foreign workers, with British companies soon to be required to advertise posts in UK JobCentres for a month before recruiting from overseas. At present, jobs have to be advertised in the UK for only a week before being offered abroad. Home secretary Alan Johnson announced this new measure Monday. He accepted recommendations from the independent Migration Advisory Committee, which last month urged tightening entry requirements for workers from outside the European Union. The measure will ensure that British workers are not only first in line for jobs but also now have more time in which to apply. The government will also extend the qualifying period for all those overseas workers who want to transfer to work at the UK base of their company meaning that they must have worked for their firm for at least a year rather than just six months prior to the move. The minimum salary that will allow an individual to qualify as a skilled worker and be eligible to work in the UK will also rise from 17,000 to 20,000. In a statement Alan Johnson said: "The introduction of the points based system has radically improved our ability to respond quickly to changing economic circumstances." "We have now accepted all of the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendations and we will continue to work with them to make sure that we use the flexibility in the points based system to the best advantage of society and the economy." Johnson said the changes will ensure that businesses can recruit the skilled foreign workers that the economy needs, but not at the expense of British workers, nor as a cheaper alternative to investing in the skills of the existing workforce. A total of sixteen recommendations were put forward by the Migration Advisory Committee, all of which will now be put in place to ensure that the points based system does more to support UK workers while continuing to facilitate the trade, travel, and study that benefits the UK. In reaching this decision, the Government has been advised by informative discussions with businesses and key public service organisations and the Government will continue to work with business to develop a plan for implementing the recommendations.
