<TITLE> Wailing baby triggers Federer's speedy win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It took a baby wailing in the stands to remind Roger Federer that his life no longer simply revolved around tennis. At 5-5 in the first set, the Swiss world number one looked like he could be heading for an unusually long workout against a player he has beaten eight times in a row since 2002. But just when Tommy Robredo started to daydream that this might be the day he would finally pull off the impossible, the howls from high up in the aisles on Arthur Ashe Stadium rudely interrupted his reverie. While 20 years ago John McEnroe might have held up proceedings to demand stewards evict the offending infant from the arena, Federer reacted by playing like a man who was running horrendously late for his children's birthday party. The Swiss world number one surrendered only four more games in a 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 fourth round win over Robredo. Day job done, it was time to get back to his real duties -- as a hands-on dad to his 46-day old twin daughters Charlene and Myla. Is the world's greatest ever racket swinger any good in the nappy changing department? "I don't know," grinned the 28-year-old. "Thank God nobody is judging me on it but I'm trying hard. I'm trying to be good at it. I guess women are always going to be better at that stuff." While he may be ready acknowledge that when it comes to handling newborns he may not be top dog, on court the holder of a record 15 Grand Slam titles has no equal. HAVING FUN After bombarding Robredo's half of the court with forehand winners, backhand masterstrokes and mystifying lobs, the five-time US Open champion was celebrating reaching his 22nd consecutive major quarter-final. A final weekend without the Swiss lurking in the horizon is almost an unthinkable scenario -- as the last time he did not reach at least the semi-finals of a grand slam was at the French Open in 2004. How does he do it? "It's just about having fun out there, playing a good match, playing good tennis, enjoying the moment, playing in packed stadiums," Federer said after posting his 38th successive win here. "It's something not many people get an opportunity to do. I think everybody would love to be in my shoes." Federer may not be wrong there but reality is that his next opponent, Swedish 12th seed Robin Soderling, will probably spend the next two days quaking in his own shoes. With a 0-11 record against the Swiss, Soderling has had little to shout about whenever he comes face-to-face with the top seed. This year he has already been cut down by Federer in the French Open final and at Wimbledon. Federer is now primed to complete a Grand Slam hat-trick against the Swede. "I'm trying to defend the title here, not just to reach another semi so my streak stays alive," he said. "I hope I can get there again. For this, I need to go through Soderling. I hope I can do it. It would be gre
