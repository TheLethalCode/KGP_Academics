<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has rejected 36 adjournment notices submitted by three opposition and one treasury MPs. The BNP's Jafrul Islam Chowdhury and Nazim Uddin Ahmed, and the lone independent MP Fazlul Azim submitted 35 notices. Awami League's Omor Faruk Chowdhury filed an adjournment notice on irrigation by submersible pumps. The opposition's notices were on the deteriorating law and order, price hike of essentials, construction of the Tipaimukh dam, tender-rigging by the ruling parties' student and youth wings, repressions on the BNP leaders and activists and the move to evict opposition chief Khaleda Zia from her cantonment house. Clarifying the cancellation of the notices, Hamid said most of the issues raised by the MP could be redressed under the law. "In addition, some notices are vague and based on assumption," the speaker said. If the notices were accepted, all other scheduled businesses of parliament would be suspended immediately to discuss the issues, he added. Parliamentary practices consider the acceptance of adjournment motions equal to "censuring" the government.
