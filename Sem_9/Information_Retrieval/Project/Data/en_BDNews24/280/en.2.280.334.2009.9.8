 KUNDUZ, Afghanistan, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A road snaking through the lush green valleys of northern Afghanistan is festooned with cheerful billboards depicting Afghan soldiers guarding groups of smiling civilians. Yet, this idyllic region, patrolled mainly by NATO's 4,000-strong German force, has turned into a battlefield again. "The Taliban have made a comeback in several northern provinces," said Mohammad Omar, governor of northern Kunduz province. "The local government here needs more foreign troops in order to root out the Taliban from Kunduz." Tucked away in the alpine meadows north of the Hindu Kush, Kunduz has been quiet since US-backed forces ousted the Taliban from pockets of Pashtun-led resistance in 2001. Attacks here have been rare even as violence surged in other parts of Afghanistan. But since last year, the Taliban have pressed ahead to try to reclaim their former northern fiefdoms -- a setback for US-led forces already struggling to contain an increasingly fierce insurgency in the south. "There are certainly some areas, including Kunduz, where the insurgency has been strengthening," said US Navy Rear Admiral Greg Smith, head of public affairs for U.S. and NATO troops. "It's a serious situation if left unchecked. (We) are focusing on Kunduz and other areas to reverse that momentum." In an incident that stoked tensions further, a US fighter jet summoned by German troops fired on Taliban-hijacked fuel trucks near Kunduz last week in an attack the government said killed many civilians. NATO has yet to finish its investigation into the incident, but has acknowledged that some civilians may have been killed. The Taliban have vowed to seek revenge. Maolawi Ahmad, the Taliban's shadow governor for Kunduz, says he has 700 fighters in a region where Taliban support is the strongest in remote Pashtun villages over which NATO and local troops exert little control. "We are strong enough to fight the Germans and government forces or whoever wishes to die," he told Reuters by telephone without elaborating. SECURITY TIGHT At a checkpoint outside Kunduz, police officers armed with Russian PK machine guns said they were ordered to boost security to prevent Taliban attacks in Kunduz, a noisy city of maze-like streets teeming with people, traffic and kite-flying children. "We have to maintain security because the Taliban are trying to get into the city," said Faizullah, the check point commander. "We must intercept them." The day he spoke to a visiting Reuters crew, a suicide bomber wounded four German soldiers in a strike on a convoy near Kunduz. Local police say that parts of the main road linking Kunduz and the capital Kabul are now controlled by the Taliban who regularly set up road blocks and attack passing vehicles. Late on Saturday, a group of Taliban fighters fired on a car travelling between Kabul and Kunduz, a policeman said. "They have come out on the road again," he said. Omar said the Taliban in his region included fighters from Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia's rebel region of Chechnya, adding they were gaining strength across the entire northern belt where Afghanistan borders ex-Soviet Central Asia. "The Taliban have infiltrated neighbouring provinces as well," he said. Just before the Aug. 20 presidential election, a roadside bomb killed six Afghan police in Baghlan, a neighbouring province in the north that has seen increased insurgent activity. Some residents say the Taliban levy a tax of 10 percent on businesses in a mafia-style network but go about doing regular daily chores such as farming, making them blend in with the population. "There are insurgents everywhere," said one local journalist. "The Germans are afraid to enter any of these villages now." With the Taliban gaining strength and tensions high after the air strike in which locals said dozens of civilians were burned alive, Kunduz residents said they felt stuck in a crossfire. "People are very unhappy around here," said Ibadullah, a man of about 50 who makes a living by driving a colourfully painted rickshaw. "The Taliban don't want to see any reconstruction he
