 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Sep8 (bdnews24.com)The government approved a 300 MW gas turbine peaking power plant at Siddhirganj in Narayanganj on Tuesday, aiming for completion by December 2011 to ease the chronic power crises and outages of the capital and outskirts. The project was given the green light at a meeting of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC), chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The construction of the new plant is expected to start this month and cost Tk 2077.41 crore. "The project work will be completed as early as possible keeping persisting power crisis into consideration," planning minister AK Khandaker told reporters after the meeting. The project project says Tk 1502.13 crore will come as assistance from the World Bank, Tk 494.35 crore from the government and the remaining Tk 80.93 crore by project implementation body Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh (EGCB) Ltd. It also mentions that a loan agreement was already signed between World Bank and the government. The background of the paper said the project has been undertaken as sufficient electricity could not be generated in line with Power System Master Plan update-2006, triggering frequent power outages that hamper the economy. Under the project, a power plant will be set up on EGCB's own land at Siddhirganj at a cost of TK 1500 crore ($221.10 million) while TK 550 crore ($ 84.60 million) will be spent on installation of 60 kilometres gas transmission line with 30 inch diameter. The deadline for bidding was Apr 30. Eight bidders participated in the competition and the papers are being scrutinised by the bidding assessment committee. The project, aimed at meeting the growing power demand in the capital city and its adjacent areas, has been included in the new project list of ADP in FY 2009-10. The ECNEC meeting also approved Tk 290 crore for bridge and culvert construction on small rural roads up to 12 kilometres. Tk 164 crore was okayed for a roads and highways department project to develop the road network covering Gaura River, Agailjhara, Paisarhat, Kotalipara and Gopalganj, including Gopalganj Bus Terminal connection road. Bogra-Rangpur National Highway development project also received Tk 39 crore. Tk 123 crore was allocated to develop district libraries. Tk 30 crore was approved for establishing 30 border outposts (BOPs) and construction of 24 kilometres of roads for battalions of Bangladesh Rifles in border areas. Gopalganj Municipality's Dead River Madhumati Rehabilitation and Adjoining Areas Development Project, and Chittagong Central Jail Expansion and Modernisation Project were allocated Tk 55 and Tk 60 crore respectively. bdnews24.co
