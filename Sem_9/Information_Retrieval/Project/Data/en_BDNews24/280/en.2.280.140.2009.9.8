 BERLIN, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected on Tuesday criticism of a deadly air strike in Afghanistan instigated by Germany and called for an agreement this year on how to transfer responsibility for security to Afghan officials. Addressing parliament three weeks before a federal election, Merkel said German troops still had a responsibility in Afghanistan but repeated a call for an international conference this year to agree how to hand over security responsibilities. This would allow NATO to reduce its troop levels. Merkel promised a comprehensive report about the strike. "We will not gloss over anything, but we will not accept any premature condemnation. I refuse to tolerate that, either from Germany or from abroad," she said on Tuesday. Merkel's government has come under intense pressure over Friday's strike in northern Afghanistan on two fuel tanks which had been called by German troops and which Afghan officials say killed scores of people, including many civilians. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called the decision a major "error of judgment". Some European partners and political critics in Germany have questioned the basis for the request for an air strike and criticised the government for being too quick in saying no civilians had been killed. Earlier on Tuesday the NATO-led force in Afghanistan said it believed civilians were killed and injured in the strike. Previously, it had only said it believed civilians were harmed. The strike was the most deadly operation involving German troops since World War Two and has also catapulted the subject of Afghanistan into the election campaign. Merkel insisted that Afghanistan must show it was willing to take on more responsibility for security. "The second presidential elections in Afghanistan mark the start of a new quality to the relations between the international community and Afghanistan," said Merkel. She said she had spoken to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nikolas Sarkozy about Afghanistan and agreed a new era was starting. "Now is the right moment, together with the new Afghanistan leadership, to set out at the end of this year how this transfer of responsibility will happen," she said. She and Brown had on Sunday called for an international conference on Afghanistan. A Forsa poll in July showed that 61 percent of Germans would like the 4,200 German troops operating in Afghanistan as part of a six-year old NATO mission to return home.
