<TITLE> Risk caused crisis, now threatens MDGs: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)Excessive deregulation and risk taking in US financial markets are at the origin of the global financial turmoil, which has threatened developing countries with greater poverty and made it harder to reach for them to Millenium Development Goals, says a newly released UN report. However, some developing countries in Asia and Latin America, with strong macroeconomic measures in place ahead of the crisis, have weathered it well, says the report. The financial crisis transformed in to a full-fledged recession affecting virtually all markets and countries either by direct financial contagion or by falling export earnings and low rate of remittance since Sep 2008, says UNCTADs Trade and Development Report 2009 released Tuesday. As a result, the world economy has experienced its first contraction since the Second World War, with attendant effects on employment in all countries. The contraction now makes it virtually impossible to reach the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015, said the report. UNCTAD economists cite deregulation of financial markets as the main cause of the global financial and economic crisis. Absence of regulation allowed uncontrolled innovation in financial instruments that obscured creditor-debtor relations and invited irresponsible risk taking. As a result, finance came to predominate over the "real" economy; a large part of the financial sector became detached from productive sectors; the report contends. The crisis that initially began in the financial sector now has turned into a dramatic downturn in the real economy; global GDP is expected to fall by more than 2.5% in 2009. The crisis is unprecedented in its depth and breadth, and has left virtually no country unscathed, the report says. GDP in the developed nations will contract by some 4% in 2009, and output in the transition economies is expected to fall by more than 6%. In developing countries, growth is expected to decelerate from 5.4% in 2008 to 1.3% in 2009. Even economies that will grow this year, such as those of China and India, are slowing significantly compared to previous years. The financial crisis spread quickly from the subprime mortgage segment of the United States financial market to the entire financial system of that country and, almost simultaneously, to the financial markets of other developed countries. The credit crunch affected activity in the real economy, accelerating a fall in employment and private demand and causing the most severe recession since the Great Depression. In the first quarter of 2009, gross fixed capital formation and manufacturing output in most of the worlds major economies fell at double digit rates. Meanwhile, problems with solvency in the non-financial sectors of many countries have begun to feed back into the financial system. Almost all developing countries have experienced sharp slowdowns in economic growth since mid-2008, and many have also slipped into recession. Some developing and emerging-market economies have proved less vulnerable than in previous crises. These are economies in Asia and Latin America that had built relatively strong macroeconomic positions before the current crisis erupted, the report said. But, many other emerging-market economies, including several in Eastern Europe, felt the impact of the crisis through a general loss of confidence in financial markets worldwide and in Eastern European markets abilities to cope with external financial exposure East and South Asia are expected to grow by 3-4% during 2009, the report says. The leading economies of these regions -- in particular China and India -- have resisted recessionary forces better than others because their domestic markets play a more important role. Many developed and emerging-market economies have launched sizeable fiscal stimulus packages while developing and transition economies that had to seek financial support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are being given insufficient fiscal space, said the report. In the current dramatic crisis situation, low-income countries require more support in the form of an internationally coordinated effort to increase official development assistance (ODA), the TDR 09 contends. The likelihood of a recovery in the major developed countries that would be strong enough to bring the world economy back to its pre-crisis growth path in the coming years is quite low, the TDR cautions. That is because neither consumption nor investment growth can be expected to revive significantly anytime soon due to very low capacity utilization and rising unemployment. More over, banks still need to be recapitalized and their balance sheets cleansed of toxic assets before they can be guided back to their traditional role as providers of credit to investors in fixed capital. Large injections of central bank money and the sharply rising budget deficits in many countries have prompted concerns of an inflationary revival. But such risks are greatly overestimated, the report says. Deflation - not inflation - is the real danger, says the report. To halt the contraction of GDP and reduce the risk of deflation, governments and central banks need to maintain, or even further strengthen, the expansionary stance of monetary and fiscal policies, the report says. Against this background, it is predicted that global GDP growth may turn positive again in 2010, but such growth is unlikely to exceed 1.6%
