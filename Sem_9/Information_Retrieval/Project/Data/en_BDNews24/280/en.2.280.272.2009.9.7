 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The BGMEA admitted "error" and made a full apology on Monday for last week's controversial ultimatum, demanding immediate payment of a Tk 30 billion recession package, warning that thousands of garment workers would otherwise go without salaries and bonuses ahead of Eid. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted the demand at a press conference last Thursday, which drew flack from government, workers and at least one other major trade body. BGMEA president Salam Murshedi had told the press conference that 40 percent of factory owners would be unable to pay due salaries and bonuses ahead of Eid because of adverse business conditions, adding they would not be held responsible for any consequent instability in the sector. The association's acting president Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin told reporters at BGMEA Bhaban on Monday, "We wanted to speak out about losses incurred by the recession, but out of frustration our tone was wrong and some mistakes in language occurred." "To err is human. Business has been bad due to the recession. The BGMEA was under pressure, but if we made any mistake, we apologise," said Mohiuddin. He also called on the association's members to settle employee salaries and Eid bonuses "at the earliest opportunity". BGMEA had demanded the Tk 30 billion (Tk 3,000 crore) by Sep 7 to salvage the industry and help clear worker wages and allowances, citing recession fallout even though the readymade garment sector saw around 15 percent growth in exports last year. Finance minister AMA Muhith immediately dismissed the demand, and on Sunday said it had been "improper" for the organisation to link any recession or stimulus package with wages and bonuses prior to Eid. b
