 Narsinghdi, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)Leaders of Narsinghdi district chapter of Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association have put up barricades across the Dhaka-Sylhet highway on Tuesday noon protesting the government's decision of importing eggs from India. The agitating poultry businessmen have blocked the highway at Bhelanagar from 12 noon, leaving hundreds of vehicles stuck and waiting at that point on the busy highway. The disgruntled traders have given the government seven days to repeal the decision to import egg. Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association's Narsingdi chapter president Tajul Islam and general secretary Hasanuddin Sarkar told bdnews24.com that their district alone supplies 25 percent of the country's total egg needs. They will go for wider movement and demonstrations unless the government cancels the decision within a week, Islam warned. The demonstrators earlier submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner. Policemen have been deployed to maintain law and order at Bhelanagar. The government recently permitted GM Enterprise to import 20 crore eggs from India, where the first delivery of 3 lakh eggs reached Aug 31. Retail price of eggs as stated in the website of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh was Tk 24-25 per hali (four eggs) for red eggs while Tk 23-24 for white ones. It was Tk 29-30 and Tk 28-29 respectively in August. Commerce minister Farukh Khan on Sep 2 warned entrepreneurs that permission would be given to import chicks if hatchery owners failed to reduce their prices in the local market. His warning came as imports of eggs, despite protest from businessmen, had successfully lowered egg prices in the domestic market. bdn
