 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)A Sanowara Group official reported being shot on Tuesday, with muggers snatching over Tk 2 lakh from his possession at Malibagh's Chowdhuryparha in the capital, but police said they were suspicious of the circumstances. Arup Ratan Roy, the chief accountant of Sanowara Group, told bdnews24.com that he along with accountant Saiful Islam were heading towards their own office in the morning after drawing about Tk 2.25 lakh from an NCC Bank branch adjacent to the office at 80/ B Malibagh Chowdhuryparha. After they had walked about 30 yards off the bank, the muggers swooped on them and tried to snatch the bag with money from Islam, Roy said. As a struggle ensued, they shot Saiful in the left leg and wrenched the bag away. Nizamuddin, company's area manager, who happened to be with them, fled the scene at that stage. The bullet-hit Islam has been admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Rampura police chief Ali Ahmed Hashmi, however, told bdnews24.com that they are puzzled by a number of thingsthe accounts personnel carrying the money from the bank on foot instead of using the office car, and Saiful getting hit in the left toe. Police have initiated a probe into the incident, he added. bdnew
