<TEXT>
 Rangamati, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Land surveys in the Chittagong Hill Tracts Land will start from Oct 15, with a tentative timeframe to restore indigenous lands within six months, the CHT Land Commission chairman said on Monday. The long-awaited surveys are being carried out in line with the 1997 CHT Peace Accord to verify claims of indigenous people who had fled to India during decades of strife, returning home after the accord was signed. Speaking to reporters after a meeting in Rangamati, commission chairmen Mohammad Khademul Islam said the schedule will be extended if surveys and restoration of lands to original owners cannot be completed within six months. Decisions will be taken after careful scrutiny of any claim or disputed over land and its handover, he said. Replying to the reporters' queries over the rehabilitation of internal refugees, he said decisions will be taken in such cases upon the application made by them and after the same careful scrutiny. He also said the land commission has been tasked with looking into illegal land settlements, too. bdn
