<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdews24.com)Information minister Abul Kalam Azad has said the government has plans to issue more licences for private TV channels. He said a national broadcast policy will be formulated keeping provision for action against the private satellite television channels. "But I cannot tell you the exact number," he told parliament on Tuesday, replying to a question from ruling Awami League MP Israfil Alam. He said the private TV channels telecast some "objectionable" advertisements and issues at talk shows. "Present laws are enough to regulate the private television channels. But I have called some owners of the private TV channels and given some directives so that they broadcast quality programmes," said the minister. "We are working on formulating a policy in this regard," Azad said. He said there was a monitoring committee at the state-run BTV to oversee the standards of the programmes telecast by the private TV channels. Azad said there was a TV code of advertising standards and practices for the private satellite channels. bdnews
