 Dhaka, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government will enforce separate timings for schools and offices from next month, a top official of the establishment ministry said Tuesday. The prime minister gave directives for staggered school and office schedules earlier this month, as authorities desperately looked for measures to reduce mounting traffic pressure on the capital. Establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud said a draft proposal for new timings is soon to be placed before the cabinet for approval. Mahmud said a meeting at the ministry with representatives from the Bangladesh Bank, FBCCI, business and financial institutions and schools on Tuesday discussed various options. According to the draft, the timing for government, semi-government and autonomous organisations has been proposed from 9am to 5pm, while banks and insurance companies will operate from 10am to 6pm. All private offices will also follow the 10am-6pm timing. Two separate timings have been proposed for educational institutions. All the primary schools will start their academic activities at 9am and end at 4.15pm. Mahmud said English medium schools, international educational institutions and secondary schools will start within 7am to 7.30am but their closing time remained undecided. Mahmud said the closing time for such schools would be decided through "mutual consent". However, he said, minimum six hours study time will be set for the single-shift schools and minimum five hours for the double-shift institutions. No corruption Meanwhile, on the issue of a recent massive overhaul in the administration, Mahmud said "no irregularities or corruption" have taken place. All decisions have been made after "proper scrutiny", he said. "If anybody thinks he has been deprived of promotion or posting, he can make a petition. The government will look into it," he said. bdnew
