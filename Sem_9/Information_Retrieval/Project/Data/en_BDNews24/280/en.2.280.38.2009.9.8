<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Sep 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is at near record levels a year from fresh elections, and with speculation of an early snap poll, despite rising unemployment and the threat of higher interest rates. Backing for Rudd's centre-left Labor was steady at 55 points in the key two-party terms which decide elections, well clear of opposition conservatives on 45 points, a Newspoll in the Australian newspaper showed on Tuesday. But support for Rudd's performance lifted 3 points to 64 percent after a fortnight in which GDP growth lifted by a stronger-than-expected 0.6 percent in the June quarter, prompting several economists to tip an interest rate rise before Christmas. The Australian dollar touched a one-year high of $0.8578, supported by a return of risk appetite as the market priced in a rate hike to 3.25 percent by November. "We are dealing with steering this country through the biggest economic shock the world has seen since the Great Depression.

Some election analysts believe Rudd could call a snap election early in 2010 to overcome upper house obstruction to emissions trading laws and capitalise on strengthening economic conditions ahead of framing the next May Budget. Rudd remained far in front of conservative opposition leader and former Goldman Sachs executive Malcolm Turnbull, with a near-record 67 percent of poll respondents rating him as a better prime minister, against just 19 percent for Turnbull. The boost comes despite rising joblessness and pressure on the government to wind back more than $53 billion in economic stimulus measures to contain rising government debt in a country where voters view national debt with suspicion. The upper house Senate was expected on Tuesday to support a special one-day public inquiry into stimulus spending, calling on Treasury Department Secretary Ken Henry to front an economics committee hearing before lawmakers next Monday. "Certainly we've had data over the past few months that are more positive than we've expected, but it's too early to be abandoning (official) forecasts," Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner told local television. Tanner said there were still serious international economic concerns which could send Australia's economy "back into serious difficulties", meaning forecasts for 8.5 percent unemployment would stay until mid-year budget updates later in the year. "It's still realistic as a possibility that we have projected based on the information at that time," Tanner s
