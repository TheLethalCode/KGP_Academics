<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 10 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh border guards foiled an attempt by Indian Border Security Force to erect barbed-wire fencing on disputed territory along the border in Bangladesh's northernmost district of Panchagarh, a BDR official said on Monday. BDR Rifles director (operations) Col Jasim Uddin told bdnews24.com, "The incident happened in Paharipara, some 8 kilometres off from pillar number 774/1 under the Malkadanga border operation post." He said both BDR and BSF lay claims to 15 acres of land there, and BSF had erected 36 metres of barbed-wire fencing on Sunday before Bangladesh border guards could stop them. "Malkadanga BDR commander protested, but the BSF did not respond and continued with the fencing," said Col Jasim. "BDR members were forced to take position with heavy arms aimed at the Indian side." He said BDR members were then able to uproot the fence without any protest from the BSF side," said Jasim. BDR called for a flag meeting, he added, but BSF informed them their commander was not at station. bd
