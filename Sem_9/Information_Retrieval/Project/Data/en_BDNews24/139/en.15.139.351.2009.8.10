<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division on Monday upheld a bail order and a stay order in two cases against Tarique Zia, elder son of opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The three-member bench, headed by justice Fazlul Karim, rejected a leave to appeal petition by the Anticorruption Commission against Tarique's bail in the Zia Orphanage Trust embezzlement case that was filed on July 3, 2008. The ACC pressed charges against Khaleda, Tarique and four other accused in the case last week. They face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. The government also sought to move against a stay order on a separate extortion case against tarique filed in 2007 by Amin Ahmed Bhuiyan, a real estate developer. A three-member bench headed by justice Tofazzal Hossain rejected the government's petition. Tarique is currently residing in the UK on parole. bdnews
