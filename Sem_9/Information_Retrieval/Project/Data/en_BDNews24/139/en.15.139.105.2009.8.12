 GENEVA, Aug 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The international community should deal with any efforts by Iran and North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons through peaceful diplomatic means, China said on Wednesday. China believes the world should work towards a global treaty banning the use of weapons in outer space and aim for a complete ban on nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said. "It is important to resolve proliferation issues through political and diplomatic means and eradicate the root causes of nuclear weapon proliferation," he said in a speech to the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Yang said Beijing was ready to work with others to promote the denuclearisation of the divided Korean peninsula and settle Iran's nuclear issue "with a view to safeguarding the international non-proliferation regime and maintaining regional peace and stability." The International Atomic Energy Agency has failed to get Iran to allow broader surveillance of its uranium enrichment plant to ensure no materials are diverted for weapons purposes, diplomats say. US President Barack Obama has given Iran until September to take up a six-power offer of talks on trade benefits if it shelves enrichment, or face harsher sanctions. The UN Security Council expanded an arms embargo on North Korea after Pyongyang's second nuclear test in May. The 65-nation conference is the world's only multilateral disarmament forum but has failed to agree any pacts since global treaties banning chemical weapons and underground nuclear tests in the 1990s. Its members include the five official nuclear weapon powers -- China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States -- as well as nuclear-capable India and Pakistan, and Israel, widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arms. NEW PAGE Pakistan is blocking a relaunch of talks on curbing production of nuclear weapons, diplomats said on Monday. Yang noted the conference had experienced a long period of stagnation, but did not refer to Pakistan directly. "His speech sends an important signal," China's disarmament ambassador Wang Qun told Reuters. "We will work in a constructive way." Yang called on the conference to launch negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty to halt the production of material used to make nuclear weapons. He welcomed talks between Russia and the United States to make further cuts in their nuclear weapons. China believed the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be encouraged as part of efforts to ban nuclear weapons, he said. Non-proliferation should not be used as an argument to interfere with the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy of countries signing up to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which formalises the restriction of nuclear weapons to the five official nuclear powers, he said. Yang also said: "Credible and effective multilateral measures must be taken to forestall the weaponisation and arms race in outer sp
