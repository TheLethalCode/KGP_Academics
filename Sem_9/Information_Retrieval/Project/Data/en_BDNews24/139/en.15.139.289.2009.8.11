<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  Shakib Al Hasan scripted a comfortable 49-run win over Zimbabwe in the second match of the GrameenPhone Cup ODI series at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Tuesday. The world's number one one-day all rounder gave another virtuoso batting performance becoming the fastest Bangladeshi to score a one-day hundred as the Tigers, put into bat, made 320-8 in 50 overs. Shakib made a whirlwind 64-ball 104, featuring nine fours and four sixes, for his third century. The previous Bangladeshi record holder was Alok Kapali with an 86-ball effort against India in the 2008 Asia Cup. For good measure Shakib returned to claim two wickets and was adjudged man of the match, which gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the five ODI series after winning the opening game by eight wickets on Sunday. The second match marked only the third time Bangladesh has surpassed 300 runs. Earlier they made 301-7 against Kenya at Bogra in March 2006 and 300-8 against UAE in the Asia Cup in Lahore in June 2008. Despite some solid knocks from Sean Willians (75) and 61 from Charles Coventry, the home side were restricted to 271 in 46.1 overs. During the post-match ceremony Zimbabwe skipper Prosper Utseya agreed his bowlers didn't stick to the plan. "We didn't bowl enough good balls in the morning and didn't vary our pace a lot. The middle order had a lot to do and we lost too many wickets early. We need to keep learning from our mistakes though we put in a much improved performance today." His Bangladesh counterpart was naturally pleased with the outcome and hoped to continue the good form into the next games. "We've been playing good cricket and hopefully we'll play just as well in the next game. Every time I come in to play, I keep getting better. Hope this continues. We need to improve in all three departments, but mainly fielding and bowling." Both sides meet again at the same venue on Friday. The Bangladesh innings was lacking momentum before Shakib arrived at the crease, as the Tigers laboured at 108-1 in 25 overs. The feature of his innings was his skill in repeatedly picking the gaps: there were quite a few hits over extra cover, a few to the straight boundary and many swings to midwicket region. He started carefully, dealing in singles and twos to reach 15, before breaking free with two pulled boundaries. The explosion started in the 38th over bowled by the part-time spinner Sean Williams with Shakib, who was denied the services of a runner just prior to the over, swinging twice over midwicket boundary. He went on to crash Ray Price to the straight boundary before lifting Prosper Utseya over long-off and twice over extra-cover as he made full use of the batting Powerplay. He was aided by some poor fielding as he was dropped twice in the inner circle: when he was on 59, Stuart Matsikenyeri spilled a sitter at midwicket off an attempted reverse-sweep against Utseya and when he was on 71, Price dropped another dolly off a top-edged paddle-sweep. Shakib went berserk after the twin drops. He looted 19 runs, with the help of three boundaries that included a stunning six over long-off, in the 44th over bowled by Chamu Chibhaba and proceeded to indulge himself. He brought up the hundred in 63 balls and celebrated it with a cheeky scoop shot against Ed Rainsford before he was run out going for the third run after Mushfiqur Rahim had slashed to deep point. Mushfiq sought to make amends for his mistake by indulging in some big hitting in the end to push Bangladesh, who were put into bat, well past 300. The platform was laid earlier in the day by Tamim who struck a 71-run partnership with Junaed Siddique at the top of the order. Only four fours came in the first fifteen overs and only one boundary was hit in the air. It not only reflected the intent of the batsmen but also the lines and length bowled by the new-ball bowlers Elton Chigumbura and Ed Rainsford. For their part, the batsmen were absolutely focused on playing themselves in before going for their shots. Tamim, who received more short balls than Junaed, stayed adjacent to the line and punched the singles and twos to the leg side. There was a glide to the fine-leg boundary but the shot of his stay was a neat adjustment he showed against Chamu Chibhabha: He had shaped to cover-drive but adjusted to the slow pace by waiting a touch and gliding it to the third-man boundary. Junaed unfurled a couple of off-side boundaries and also hit a big shot, hitting Elton Chigumbura over mid-on and was looking good when he was run out 27 off 41 overs. He pushed Utseya, who brought himself on in the 11th over, to the left of short midwicket, was caught in a yes-no situation with Tamim and couldn't get back to his crease in time. Tamim, himself, was run out soon in a comical fashion. He had missed to connect a leg-side delivery but was stranded in the middle due to a faulty call from Shakib and was easily run out by the keeper for 79 off 105 balls. The other batsmen to reach double digits were Raqibul Hasan (35) who featured in dangerous 56-ball 96-run fifth-wicket stand with the Bangladesh captain, Mushfiqur Rahim (23 not out) and Mohammad Ashraful (22). Elton Chigumbura bagged 3-59 and Chamu Chibhabha took
