 LONDON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti said he was ready for the start of the season after marking his first competitive game in charge with a penalty-shootout victory over Manchester United in the Community Shield on Sunday. "I think that I'm very happy, it was an important match and a very difficult match," the Italian, Chelsea's fifth manager in less than two years, told reporters after his side won 4-1 on spot kicks at the end of a 2-2 draw at Wembley.

"But now the game is finished we have to think of the season and the next matches." Ancelotti played down the controversy over Chelsea's second goal, scored by Frank Lampard when United defender Patrice Evra had been flattened by a crude bodycheck by Michael Ballack. With referee Chris Foy waving play on, United's players expected Chelsea to kick the ball into touch but instead Didier Drogba surged towards goal before picking out Lampard to put Chelsea 2-1 ahead with 20 minutes remaining. "The referee can stop the play and also the players can put the ball out," Ancelotti said.
