<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)President Barak Obama on Wednesday bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 16 luminaries in theatre, sports, science, the humanities and politics, including Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh for his pioneering work in micro finance. "This is a chance for me  and for the United States of America  to say thank you to some of the finest citizens of this country and of all countries," Obama said at a White House ceremony. In presenting the medal to the Bangladesh Nobel laureate Obama said, "with his belief in the self-reliance of all people, Professor Muhammad Yunus has altered the face of finance and entrepreneurship. As an academic, he struggled with pervading economic theories and their effects on the people of his native Bangladesh. "Yearning for a new way of lifting people out of poverty, he revolutionized banking to allow low-income borrowers access to credit. In the process, he has enabled citizens of the world's poorest countries to create profitable businesses, support their families and help build sustainable communities. In so doing, Muhammad Yunus has unleashed new avenues of creativity and inspired millions worldwide to imagine their own potential". It was Obama's first chance to award the medal, the highest civilian honor, since he was elected president in January. And there were some emotional moments. Among the recipients were Sydney Poitier, the black actor. When the president hugged Poitier, it was a poignant reminder of how the actor, who broke racial barriers, had paved the way for Obama's own journey to the White House. Among the luminaries who got the award were 11 Americans and five foreign nationals including Physicist Stephen Hawkins, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and UN Human Rights Commissioner. There was some controversy over the selection of Robinson who was accused by some Jewish groups for her alleged anti-Israel bias. The White House said Obama had no second thoughts about the award; during the ceremony, the president praised Robinson for her work as "an advocate for the hungry and the hunted, the forgotten and the ignored." Two of the awards  to Jack Kemp, the one-time Republican vice-presidential candidate, and Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights activist, were delivered posthumously. The only other recipient who could not make it to the White House ceremony because of his illness was Senator Edward Kennedy. His daughter, Kara, accepted the medal on his behalf. She seemed to blink back tears as she accepted the award on behalf of her. Obama introduced the honorees in alphabetical order, but saved Senator Kennedy for last, praising him as someone who has fought for soldiers, working families and students for nearly half a century, and whose life "has made a difference for us all." Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, was also among the honor
