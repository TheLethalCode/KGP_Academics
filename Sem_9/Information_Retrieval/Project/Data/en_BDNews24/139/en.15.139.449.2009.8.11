 Dhaka, August 11 (bdnews24.com)Sacked Proshika chairman, Kazi Faruque Ahmed, obtained High Court permission on Tuesday to enter the NGO's Dhaka headquarters in Mirpur. The bench of justice Md Abdus Salam gave the order on a petition filed by Faruque, but denied his request to overturn a decision of Proshika's governing body that sacked him as head of the NGO on May 24 this year. "With this order, Faruque will now be able to enter the Proshika office," Motaher Hossain, a lawyer for the plaintiff, told bdnews24.com following the decision. Moniruzzaman Asad, counsel for recently installed Proshika chairman MA Wadud, said the current Proshika committee will carry on with its work as before. "Faruque can enter the Proshika office, but not his men," said Asad. The governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-government organisations, replaced founding chairman Faruque Ahmed in May following repeated allegations by employees of corruption and nepotism. On Aug 1, the ousted chairman led over 200 supporters in a demonstration to the NGO's headquarters and attempted to force their way into the building, sparking violent clashes with Proshika employees that left at least 35 injured. b
