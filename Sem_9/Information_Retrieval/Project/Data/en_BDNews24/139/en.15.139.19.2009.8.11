 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) The government has decided to hike court fees for cases related to tax and excise, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Tuesday. Shafique did not detail when the new fees would come into effect, but did say the hiked costs would not affect the general population too much. "Court fees will be hiked. But they will not be hiked in such way that creates pressure on people," he told reporters after a secretariat meeting with top law officials, including attorney general Mahbubey Alam. Shafique said the decision was taken after discussing with leading lawyers across the country. "The hike is meant for the cases related to tax and excisethe cases usually filed by rich people." The law minister said family-related and other cases generally filed by poor people will see reduced court fees. "The government has taken care to make sure that the general public seeking justice does not face any problem," he added. bd
