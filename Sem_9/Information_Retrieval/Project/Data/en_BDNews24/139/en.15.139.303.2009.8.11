 Mohshinul Karim bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)The Saudi government's possible ban on hajj pilgrims aged below six and above 65 years to prevent a swine flu epidemic during the hajj might slash the number of Bangladeshi pilgrims by half this year, according to the state minister for religious affairs. Shahjahan Mia told bdnews24.cpm on Monday that the Saudi authoritiries was yet to officially announce the ban. Bangladesh is supposed to send around 59,000 pilgrims to the hajj, the biggest conglomeration of Muslims, late this year under government and private management. Officials at the religious affairs ministry said the Bangladesh consul in Saudi Arabia recently wrote to the ministry to say that the Saudi government has decided to clamp the ban pilgrims below six and above 65 years of age. "We don't have any specific information about how many pilgrims will not able to go for hajj if the ban imposed, but the number can come down to half," Mia said. "This will cause hurt Bangladesh, but the government will try its best to minimise the potential loss." The Hajj Association of Bangladesh president Ibrahim Bahar said if the decision is finalised, a maximum 20,000 to 25,000 pilgrims will be able to perform hajj. Bahar said the hajj agencies have already spent around Tk 100,000 on each pilgrim for hajj management and will not able to get back the money, which means they will not be able return the money to the potential ineligible pilgrims. bd
