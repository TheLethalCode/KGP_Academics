 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Chaotic urban growth and collapsing civic amenities have combined to create the perfect equation for the city's chronic water-logging problem, a roundtable was told on Wednesday. "Twenty-three natural canals that drain rain water into the Buriganga River remain heavily clogged with waste material, this is due to utterly unplanned urban development," Sardar Amin, president of Bangladesh Development and Information Forum, told the roundtable at Mukti Bhaban. Amin called on activists to build a 'common platform' to campaign for an end to the miseries caused by the long-standing problem. The city's inability to cope was sharply highlighted on July 28, when record breaking overnight rains brought Dhaka to a standstill. The capital's crumbling amenities and drainage system collapsed under the weight of the water, leaving low-lying areas inundated under knee-to-waist high water, streets impassable and thousands of people stranded in homes. Concrete pipes used to drain some areas in the city are of low-quality and lack the diameter to efficiently transfer water to the main drainage system, said Amin. He said WASA, as the responsible body for dealing with water-logging in the city, had failed to install sufficient pumping stations. "The storm-water drainage system is also far too small," said Amin, who added that the public were partially to blame for polluting drains and canals in the city. Kazi Md Shish, a former chief engineer of WASA, accused the utility provider of chronic mismanagement and of misleading government ministries regarding water-logging. Shish said poor coordination between government agencies such as the Water Development Board, WASA, Dhaka City Corporation and RAJUK led to chaos and corruption in the construction and maintenance of civic infrastructure. He suggested that service providers should be brought under a single authority to ensure efficiency and accountability. President of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Manjurul Ahsan Khan, presided at the discussion and suggested a single umbrella organisation could effectively coordinate activism on the critical issue. Khan said public awareness of environmental issues was essential to finding a long-term solution to the problem. The discussion was titled 'Urban Water Logging Problem: Citizens' Thoughts', organised by Nagorik Songhoti and Bangladesh Development and Information Forum
