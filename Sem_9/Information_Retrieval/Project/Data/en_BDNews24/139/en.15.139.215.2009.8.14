 LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian John Dyson was sacked as coach of West Indies on Thursday. "The services of Mr John Dyson have been terminated with immediate effect," the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said in a news release. "Assistant coach Mr David Williams will fill this position on a temporary basis." Williams is to lead the team at the Champions Trophy in South Africa next month while former Test spinner Lance Gibbs will serve as manager.

However, West Indies were one run short of the Duckworth-Lewis target, the method used to calculate results when the full overs are unused, and with no opportunity to return to the field England were declared winners with West Indies on 244 for seven from 46.2 overs. "I was on the wrong column (on the sheet) ... I thought we were ahead of Duckworth-Lewis but in fact we were behind by one run," Dyson said. "There was a lot of noise going on and it was my responsibility so that was it. I accept responsibility for it and I've apologised to the team and that's all I can do. It was my mist
