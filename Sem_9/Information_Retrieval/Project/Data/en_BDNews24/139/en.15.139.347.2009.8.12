 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court deferred hearing of embezzlement charges against opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia in the Zia Orphanage Trust case on Wednesday, as Khaleda, son Tarique Rahman and four other accused in the case did not appear. Senior metropolitan special judge ANM Bashirullah set Aug 30 for the next hearing, asking the accused to appear in the court on the day. Khaleda's lawyer Jaynal Abedin Mesbah told the court his client could not appear in the court because of security concerns. He asked the court to issue an order to the government to ensure her security. "If security is ensured, Khaleda Zia would not have any problem appearing in the court," Mesbah said. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, her elder son Tarique Rahman and four others in the case on Aug 5. Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and Kamal Uddin Siddiqui. A total of 36 people have been listed as state witnesses in the case, investigating officer Harun-or-Rashid has said. The Supreme Court last week upheld previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case that filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. b
