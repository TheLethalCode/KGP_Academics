<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked Arafat Rahman Coco, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, and his lawyers to explain the forgery allegations against them after the government accused them last week of filing a petition with the court through a 'fake' power of attorney document. Coco's petition to the High Court, filed on Aug 2, challenges a money laundering case against him filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year. The government filed a counter petition with the court three days later, on Aug 5, accusing Coco and his lawyers of producing a fake power of attorney in filing the petition. The government sought permission to file criminal cases against those who were involved with adopting illegal means in filing Coco's petition. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Monday asked Coco, his two lawyers, power of attorney Taherul Islam Touhid and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan to explain within three weeks why forgery charges should not be investigated. The court also stayed the hearing on Coco's petition. The same High Court bench is proceeding separately on Coco's petition that was filed on Aug 2 by Taherul Islam Touhid claiming power of attorney on behalf of Coco who is currently residing in Thailand. After the ruling, attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters, "Their petition was filed placing false documents. The court took it into concern and made the ruling." "The court asked them to explain why the forgery charges should not be investigated and a case filed." Mahbubuddin Khokan, Coco's lawyer, said only, "The court has asked to know about the power of attorney." Additional attorney general Murad Reza said, "The court has postponed hearing of Coco's petition until the government's petition is resolved. Besides, a ruling was given against Coco and his lawyers." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court on Aug 5 that the proper official of the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand had not certified the power of attorney claimed by Touhid in the hearing of Coco's petition. Alam also said the power of attorney showed a false address. He accused Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokon of falsely attesting his client's signature on the alleged power of attorney. 'Clearly forged' He said "it was clear" Coco did not authorise Touhid's signature and that the power of attorney was "a forged and fabricated document". Alam produced a fax on Monday, telling the High Court bench it was sent by Syed Golam Zahid, of the Bangladesh Embassy in Thailand. "A legal document of a Bangladeshi outside the country must be sent attested and through the embassy. It was not followed in this case," he said. "The power of attorney was not attested by a notary-public and is signed by a lawyer of a private legal firm." Alam said, "Barrister Khokon went to Bangkok on January 27 and signed on the following day. If the case was filed on March 17, how could Coco give the power of attorney to challenge the case's legality before the case was even filed? Doesn't it prove that it was false?" The ACC case against Coco, filed in March under the Money Laundering Act 2009, accuses him of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. Stay upheld on illegal wealth case In a separate development on Monday, the Appellate Division rejected a petition by the Anticorruption Commission seeking to appeal against a High Court stay order on proceedings of an illegal wealth case against Coco. b
