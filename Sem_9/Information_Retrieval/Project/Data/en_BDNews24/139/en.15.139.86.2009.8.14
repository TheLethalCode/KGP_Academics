<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  All unsettled issues of the Bangabandhu murder trial, including execution of the verdict, will be fast tracked, the Awami League general secretary said on Friday, eve of National Mourning Day. "There are a number of unsettled issues ahead of the nation. Of them, we want to execute the verdict of the Bangabandhu murder case, revive the Jail Killings case and begin trial of war crimes," said AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, also local government minister, in a discussion at the Bangabandhu Mausoleum Complex of Tungipara in Gopalganj on the eve of the Aug 15 mourning day. Independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed along with family members on Aug 15, 1975. Soon after, four national leaders Syed Nazrul Islam, M Mansur Ali and AHM Kamruzzaman, were killed in Dhaka Central Jail, on Nov 3, 1975, which came to be known as the Jail Killings. None of the killers in either cases have been brought to justice. Convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case still have appeals pending in the Supreme Court 34 years after the killings. Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim presided over the discussion on Friday. Abdur Razzak, Motiya Chowdhury, Kazi Zafarullah, Abdul Latif Siddiqui and Satish Chandra Roy spoke, among others. Chowdhury said, "The people of Bangladesh cast votes for truth, justice and progress in the Dec 29 elections." "The verdict of the Bangabandhu murder case must be carried out on the soil of Bangladesh." The mausoleum of the independence hero was crowded since morning as members of the new Awami League committee, announced last week, visited the site. The party leaders paid tribute at the grave by laying wreaths at noon. bdn
