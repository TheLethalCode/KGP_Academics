 Cox's Bazar, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion raided a makeshift 'munitions factory' on Moheskhkhali island in Cox's Bazar on Thursday, arresting three men with eight half-constructed firearms and a huge amount of gun-manufacturing equipment, RAB officials said. Gura Miah, Rahmat Ali and Farid Alam, arrested from Boro Moheshkhali Union, are now being grilled, said sub-inspector Abdul Hannan of RAB-7. "Had another day passed, the work here would have been completed," assistant superintendent of police at RAB-7 Saidul Islam told bdnews24.com. The seized equipment could have produced over 50 firearms, he said. "The makeshift factory was erected out of plastic sheets, mainly, on the Sharshia hilltop in a nearly deserted area in the union," he said. RAB launched the raid at 5pm Thursday, on a tip-off, with two teams from Moheskhkhali and Teknaf, Islam said. RAB officials said the arrested men had initially confessed that pirates, who kidnapped fisherman and robbed trawlers in the Bay of Bengal, were the main buyers of their arms. Criminal gangs who grabbed shrimp enclosures and land in the Moheshkahli area also bought the arms, they said. Officer in charge of Moheshkhali police station Swapan Kumar Nath told bdnews24.com that a case was had been lodged. bdn
