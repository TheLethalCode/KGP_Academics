 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  The killing of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with his family in 1975 aimed Bangabandhu's killing aimed at destroying the secular democratic state of a newly independent Bangladesh, said prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the slain leader, on Friday. "Anti-liberation forces committed an ill act to destroy the tradition, culture, and progress of the Bangla nation through the killing," the prime minister said in her message to the nation on the eve of Aug 15 National Mourning Day. Mujib and members of his family were killed in their home by army officers on Aug 15 1975. Hasina and her younger sister Rehana, in West Germany at the time, were the only survivors of the immediate family. "Bangabandhu was killed as he was engaged in making a war-torn country into his dream of a Golden Bengladesh by uniting all," said Hasina in her statement. She reminisced about those killed on the day and wished peace for all of their souls. Hasina said the killers, anti liberation forces, were rewarded instead of brought to justice for the killings. She also said they introduced the politics of murders, coups and conspiracies to the newly-born nation, toppling the constitutional government of Bangladesh. Those slain on Aug 15, 1975, alongside Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, were Mujib's wife Begum Fazilatunnesa, eldest son Sheikh Kamal, Kamal's wife Sultana Kamal Khuki, Mujib's second son Sheikh Jamal, Jamal's wife Parveen Jamal Rosy, Mujib's youngest son Sheikh Russel, Mujib's younger brother Sheikh Abu Naser, Mujib's nephew Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, Moni's pregnant wife Begum Arju Moni, Mujib's brother in law Abdur Rab Serniabat, Serniabat's daughter, nephew, son and grandson, as well as Abdul Nayeem Khan Rintu and colonel Jamaluddin Ahmed who were not directly related to Mujib. b
