Sutrapur police chief Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com that the dead youth Roman, 19, a resident of Postogola in Dhaka, died amid "an exchange of fire" between police and a gang who were attempting to rob a couple of traders at around 3am. Babul, a greengrocer at Shyambazaar, told bdnews24.com that he was returning to his Faridabad home with business partner Mamun in the early hours. "Three men stopped our rickshaw, threatened us with sharp weapons and attempted to rob us," said Babul. Local police chief Hossain said, "A police van arrived, the policemen tried to nab the muggers and a scuffle ensued during which a mugger stabbed police constable Abdul Ali and fled the scene." "The other two suspects then opened fire on the police as they tried to flee and the police returned fire." "That was when Roman got shot. He died on the spot," said Hossain.
