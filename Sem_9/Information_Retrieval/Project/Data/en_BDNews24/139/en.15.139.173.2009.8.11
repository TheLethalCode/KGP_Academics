 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has suggested that Bangladesh take the India route to link to the Asian Highway network instead of the route that runs through Myanmar. However, the parliamentary standing committee on communications ministry stopped short of making final recommendations on the Indian route for the hook-up to the 141,000 kilometres of standardised roadways crisscrossing 32 Asian countries with linkages to Europe. Nazrul Islam Manju, the lone member of the main opposition BNP, did not oppose the suggestions of the standing committee dominated by ruling Awami League MPs. The BNP says the Asian Highway must enter Bangladesh from India and then connect China via Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries. The party says the government was planning to give India transit facilitiesa politically sensitive issue in Bangladeshto help the neighbour to reach its economically backward northeastern states. "India surrounds us from three sides. So, we have to get connected with the Asian highway through India," Sheikh Mujibor Rahman, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building on Tuesday. "The highway through India will benefit us very much as we have had huge trade with India," said the chairman. He said his committee had suggested accepting any of the two routes of the Asian highway namely Benapole-Dhaka-Sylhet and Banglabandha-Dhaka-Sylhet. "The ruling party MPs have suggested the government on the routes of the highway. But we have not made recommendations on it," Manju, the BNP MP, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "I have just read it as my party has been observing the development on the issue," he said. He said the government must first decide the routes of the highway. "Then we will make final recommendation on it." According to the first route, the highway will enter from the West Bengal of India through Benapole in Bangladesh and then re-enter India's northeastern Assam state via Tamabil border in Sylhet. A second proposal says the highway will enter Bangladesh from India through Banglabandha (Panchagarh) and finally meet Indian roads through Tamabil. The BNP says the highway finally must pass through Myanmar via Teknaf border. Golam Moula Roni, a standing committee member, told journalists that the highway should not pass through Teknaf as Bangladesh had small volume of trade with Myanmar. "In addition, we will not be benefited at all if we go for Taknaf route to get connected with China through Kunming (Yunan province). "We don't have any business dealings with Kunming and that part of China," said Roni. The main opposition BNP after coming to power in 2001 initiated a new foreign policy approach styled "Look East Policy" aimed at making closer relations with China. The BNP government did not finalise the routes of the Asian Highway in its five-year term from 2001. It tried to construct a cross-boundary highway through MyanmarBangladesh's only second neighbourto connect China by road through Kunming. The immediate-past military-installed caretaker government signed a deal on the cross-boundary road in 2007. The Asian Highway project was initiated in 1959 to promote the development of international road transport in the region, but progress slowed down when financial assistance was suspended in 1975, according to UNESCAP. A total of US$26 billion has already been invested in the improvement and upgrading of the ambitious network but $18 billion is still needed.
