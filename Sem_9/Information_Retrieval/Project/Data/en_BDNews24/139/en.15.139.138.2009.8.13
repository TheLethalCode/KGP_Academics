 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)A US federal jury has found Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, an American of Bangladeshi descent, guilty on terrorism charges, after a trial that lasted seven days. Sadequee, 23, arrested in Bangladesh by the FBI in 2006, faces up to 60 years in federal prison, a statement of the US State Department said on Thursday. He was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, including Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET). Sentencing is scheduled on Oct. 15. According to the evidence presented during the trial, which began on August 3, 2009, Sadequee was born in Fairfax, Virginia, in 1986. He attended school in the United States, Canada, and Bangladesh. In December 2001, while living in Bangladesh, he sent an email seeking to join the Taliban, to help them in their fight against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan, said trial documents. In late 2004 and early 2005, Sadequee, having returned to the United States to his family home in Roswell, Georgia, entered an illegal agreement - a conspiracy - with others to provide material support to terrorists engaged in "violent jihad", said prosecutors. "The evidence indicated that the material support consisted of Sadequee's co-defendant, Syed Haris Ahmed, who was convicted after a bench trial in June 2009; and other individuals who intended to provide themselves as personnel to engage in violent jihad abroad and in the United States," said the prosecutors' statement. The evidence also included short videos of symbolic and infrastructure targets for potential terrorist attacks in the Washington DC area, including the US Capitol and the World Bankall of which were taken by Sadequee and Syed Haris Ahmed to be sent to "the jihadi brothers" abroad. At trial the government presented evidence that Sadequee and his co-conspirators used the internet to develop relationships and maintain contact with each other and with other supporters of violent jihad in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bosnia and elsewhere. "In March 2005, Sadequee and his co-conspirators planned to travel to Pakistan in an effort to attend a paramilitary training camp operated by terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Tayeba (LET), as preparation for engaging in violent jihad abroad or in the United States," prosecutors said. The government also presented evidence at trial that in 2005, Sadequee departed Atlanta for Bangladesh, carrying with him, hidden in the lining of his suitcase, an encrypted CD, a map of Washington DC, that included all of the targets he and Syed Haris Ahmed had cased. Once in Bangladesh, Sadequee began to conspire more closely with Younis Tsouli and Mirsad Bektasevic, a Swedish national of Serbian origins. Specifically, Tsouli, Bektasevic, Sadequee and others formed a violent jihadist organization known as "Al Qaeda in Northern Europe." The group was to be based in Sweden and focus on terrorist attacks in Europe. The evidence at trial showed that in October 2005, Sadequee sought a visa that would allow him to relocate from Bangladesh to Sweden. Bektasevic has since been convicted of terrorism offenses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is imprisoned there. Meanwhile, Syed Haris Ahmed remained in contact with Sadequee, and in March 2006, Ahmed was approached by FBI agents. Efforts by the FBI to obtain Ahmed's cooperation in the ongoing international terrorism investigation ended after the FBI discovered that Ahmed was surreptitiously contacting Sadequee, who was still in Bangladesh, to advise him of the FBI investigation and warn him not to return to the United States. Sadequee was eventually arrested on April 20, 2006, in Bangladesh, on charges arising out of false statements he made in an August 2005 interview with the FBI at JFK Airport in the Eastern District of New York. Sadequee was indicted in the district on July 19, 2006, and transferred to Atlanta in August of that year. The case was investigated by agents and officers of the Atlanta Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), led by the FBI's Atlanta Division, with assistance from law enforcement agencies in several other countries. The jury deliberated for approximately five hours before reaching the guilty verdict in the trial presided over by US district judge William S Duffey, Jr. Sadequee elected to represent himself, with stand-by counsel present to assist him as requested
