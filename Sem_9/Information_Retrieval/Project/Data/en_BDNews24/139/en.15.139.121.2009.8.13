 LIVERPOOL, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool have cashed in on midfielder Xabi Alonso and their lack of financial muscle means they have been unable to compete for stellar signings like Valencia striker David Villa.

That sparked a bitter war of words between the pair and it was Ferguson who enjoyed the last laugh by clinching the title for the third successive season. The fitness of England midfielder Steven Gerrard and Spain striker Fernando Torres is also key to Liverpool's ambitions. Injuries meant the pair started only 14 Premier League matches together last season. If Gerrard and Torres stay fit, Liverpool's long wait for the title could soon be
