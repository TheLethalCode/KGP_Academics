 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has said that the continuance of a caretaker government system for elections is "a political issue and on the part of the government to consider". "It is possible to hold a fair election under a political government if it wishes," Huda said on Wednesday. "The Election Commission will give its opinion on the matter if asked," he told reporters after opening a workshop titled '9th Parliamentary Election: A Critical Appraisal'. The main concern of the EC is to get the logistical support and to ensure voters' security during an election, he said. Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, on June 28, asked parliament to consider revoking the caretaker government system. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad and other MPs subsequently made the same proposal. "In the past we saw voters suffer from insecurity during elections under political governments," Huda said on Wednesday. But, he added, the EC is ready to hold elections under any administration if a free and fair poll and security of voters are ensured. Support the Electoral Process in Bangladesh, a project of the EC Secretariat, organised the daylong workshop at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, attended by EC officials, election specialists, foreign diplomats and the national and international observer organisations of the 9th parliamentary polls held on Dec 29 last year. The CEC told the workshop that the commission "did not sit idle after holding a fair election". The EC was being further strengthened by filling manpower shortages, setting up countrywide server stations and forming a comprehensive database, said Huda. He said the commission also has plans to hold discussions with political parties over how to make the elections more accountable, reforms of electoral laws and updating voter lists. He also said the current government was not meddling in the commission's affairs. More work plans would be implemented during the term of the current commission, said the elections chief. The incumbent Election Commission has completed half of its five-year term. bde
