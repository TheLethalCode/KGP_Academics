 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The communications ministry has been told to take necessary measures to ensure smooth movement of buses operated by the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation. The parliamentary standing committee on communications made the recommendation Tuesday as private operators, mainly in Southern districts, have been observing transport strikes in recent weeks demanding withdrawal of BRTC buses. The committee also entrusted seven MPs to help resolve the problems by holding talks with the private bus owners and the local administration. Private bus operators were most recently observed transport strikes in Khulna, Pirjpur, Jhalakathi and Bagerhat districts demanding withdrawal of the BRTC buses. "We have recommended restoration of BRTC bus services in the districts troubled by the transport strikes by the private operators," Sheikh Mujibor Rahman, the standing committee chairman, told journalists after a meeting at parliament. He said both the private owners and BRTC had the right to operate buses on the same routes. "The committee has suggested the ministry procure more buses both for the city and district routes," said Golam Moula Roni, a member of the committee. Roni told reporters that the previous BNP government signed a deal with private operators to withdraw BTRC buses from the many inter-district routes. In the 7th parliament, several MPs, who were also bus company owners, including a chairman of a parliamentary standing committee, forced the government to strike the deal banning BRTC buses. The former communications minister Nazmul Huda had informed parliament about the agreement with the private bus operators at the time. But the military-installed caretaker government reintroduced BRTC buses on the routes after the promulgation of state of emergency on January 11, 2007. The private owners have been making similar demands again resulting in huge public suffering as intermittent strikes paralyse road communications in many districts.
