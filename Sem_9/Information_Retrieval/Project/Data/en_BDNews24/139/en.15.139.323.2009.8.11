 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the bail of opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia in GATCO corruption case. The three-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim rejected a 'leave to appeal' filed by the Anticorruption Commission seeking a reversal of the bail order for the former prime minister by the High Court. Khaleda secured bail from the High Court in last September. The graft watchdog filed the case on Sept 2, 2007 and the BNP chairperson and younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested a few hours later on that day. According to case details, the defendants caused the loss of Tk 15 crore to the state by awarding the management of Chittagong port and Inland Container Depot at Kamalapur to Global Agro Trade Company. Barristers Rafique-ul-Huq, Moudud Ahmed and Mahbubuddin Khokan stood for Khaleda while advocate Khurshid Alam Khan for the ACC. The High Court on Tuesday extended the bail of Tarique Rahman, the elder son of Khaleda, for six months in Zia Orphanage Trust embezzlement case and two extortion cases. b
