<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)A drug rehabilitation centre and a contractor's office in Mohammadpur were vandalised Wednesday night, allegedly by members of Jubo League attempting to extort money. Rashedullah, director of drug rehabilitation centre 'Jiboner Alo', said a Jubo League leader, known locally as Shafiq, demanded Tk 50,000 from him in the name of contributing to a Aug 15 National Mourning Day programme to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's death anniversary. "On Wednesday, Shafiq and some other men came to the centre to collect the demanded money, and failing to secure the sum they wrecked the centre and beat three of the staff," Rashedullah told bdnews24.com. "They stole some cash and mobile phone sets before they left." Rashedullah said the gang also vandalised a nearby contractor's office. Hafizuddin, sub-inspector of Rayerbazar Police Camp, however, had a different version of events. He told bdnews24.com, "We heard that a boy was beaten up in the drug centre and Shafiq went to his aid. Later some unknown people vandalised the place." "The director of the centre told me that Shafiq had demanded money from him, but he did not submit any writtten complaint," Hafizuddin said. Mominur Rahman Sikder, vice-president of Jubo League's Ward 43 unit, said Shafiq was not a member of the pro-Awami League organisation and had apparently tried to take advantage of the Jubo League name. A volunteer at the drug centre said the same gang had previously demanded extortion money, but failed to collect due to the intervention of a local commissioner. bdnew
