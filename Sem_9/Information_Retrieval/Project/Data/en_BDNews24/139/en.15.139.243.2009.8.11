 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Environment Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh was shaken by tremors as a major quake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India's Andaman Islands, giving rise to a tsunami warning in the region in the early hours of Tuesday. The quake, which struck around 3am Bangladesh time, triggered the tsunami alert by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre for India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand. On-duty official Abdur Rahman of Meteorology Department told bdnews24.com that the tsunami alert was withdrawn around 7am. No tsunami was reported from the coastal areas, but people close to the coastal belt were asked to move with caution until 8:30am. Rahman had earlier told bdnews24.com that the quake, which was felt at 2:55:42am Bangladesh time, had its epicentre 980 kilometres south-southeast of the Dhaka Met Office. Many in capital Dhaka, Chittagong and other places were shaken out of their sleep in the wee hours by tremors. Banker Reisuddin Ahmed, a resident of Uttara told bdnews24.com he felt two tremor,s at 2:55 am for a few seconds and 3am for another few seconds. "The furniture shook both times," he said. Lalmatia resident Khairul Alam told bdnews24.com he was jolted out of his sleep at around 3am after his bed shook. "Many people in my building went out onto the streets in panic." At least 3 people were reported injured in Moheshkhali, Cox's Bazar, as a wall collapsed on them. Nearer the epicentre, Reuters correspondent Sanjit Kumar Roy in Port Blair, capital of the Andaman Islands, said that in the northern part of the island, people ran out of their houses in panic. "[My] room shook for around 20 to 30 seconds, it was quite strong." The US Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.7, struck off the Andamans at 1:55 am local time (1955 GMT on Monday). It was shallow, at a depth of 20.6 miles, and was centered 160 miles north of Port Blair. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center immediately issued a tsunami watch for the region. "Earthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a destructive local tsunami and sometimes a destructive regional tsunami along coasts located usually no more than a thousand kilometers (about 600 miles) from the earthquake epicenter," the tsunami center said in its bulletin. However, an official at the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services said a tsunami warning had not been issued by his department. "We have not issued a tsunami alert and are monitoring the water level changes in the region at the moment," Ajay Kumar told Reuters by phone. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean. A 7.6 magnitude quake is classified by the USGS as a major earthquake and is capable of widespread, heavy damage. An even bigger quake in the Indian Ocean in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed some 228,000 people. bdnews
