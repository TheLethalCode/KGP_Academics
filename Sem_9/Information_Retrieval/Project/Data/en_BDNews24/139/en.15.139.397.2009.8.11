 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)Anisul Haq, the chief prosecution counsel, has said the hearing on the appeal by convicts against the High Court judgment in the murder trial of independence hero Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is not taking place before Aug 15. Haq broke the news to the media at a press briefing in his chamber on Tuesday, just two days after law minister Shafique Ahmed had said the appeal hearing was likely to begin before Aug 15, the National Mourning Day. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had also said last week that documents would be placed with the Appellate Division within a week for resumption of appeal hearings in the Bangabandhu murder trial. Prosecutor Anisul Haq, who is also an additional attorney general, echoed Alam. He said on Tuesday, "Very soon, in not more than seven working days, the brief of the appeal will be submitted for hearing." The brief report has highlighted the reasons why the appeal of the defendant should be dismissed. "It has been prepared. Now research is going on because it is a historic case," said Haq. Before the press briefing, he told bdnews24.com that the brief of the appeal would be submitted at the court as soon as Wednesday. Asked whether the hearing will start from Aug 28 before the the Supreme Court goes into vacation, he said the application will be submitted to the court of the chamber judge, meaning it will be filed during vacation. The chief justice will also be urged to form a bench and once that is constituted and the date will be set for hearing. Questioned about the delay since the defendants had submitted the brief of their appeal long ago, Haq said during the hearing of the leave to appeal one of the defendants, AKM Mohiuddin, was deported from the United States to Bangladesh. After more than 2,000 days of the appeal, Mohiuddin appealed for pardon for the delay and added that he did not know that he had been convicted in the case. He came to know about it after he was taken to the jail on arrest at the Zia International Airport, Haque further quoted Mohiuddin as stating in the appeal. "But on the internet I came to know that Mohiuddin said at the US immigration court that he is a convict in Bangabandhu murder case. The noose is hanging above his head. He was involved in this murder," said Haque. "The court asked for the certified copies from that US court after I said those. I could not present the copy at that time. Recently I have managed to collect the papers from US. "These have been included in the brief. because of this reason the submission of the brief has been delayed," Haq explained. He said an additional paper book has been prepared along with the one for the appeal and it will also be submitted 'soon'. Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975 and the case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. No-one was allowed to file a case. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then the president, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam on October 2, 1996 filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 persons. On Nov 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused persons. Four jailed accused major (retd) Bazlul Huda, lt col (sacked) Syed Faruk Rahman, lt col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and lt col (red) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the trial court verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentence of 10 accused but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentence of 15 accused. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentence of 12 accused and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four jailed accused submitted leave to appeal in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Col Majed are absconding. Absconding accused Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. President Zillur Rahman's appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division on July 14 this year, raising the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage, and cleared the way for the Bangabandhu murder trial among other to see a conclusion. bdne
