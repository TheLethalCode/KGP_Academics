 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  A maiden century by Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor (94) powered Zimbabwe to a challenging total of 323-7 in 50 overs against Bangladesh in the third match of the Grameenphone Cup Series at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Friday. It is Zimbabwe's highest score against Bangladesh beating 310-6 made in Dhaka in March 1999. Masakadza who was out for 102 featured in a brilliant fourth-wicket stand of 142 with Taylor, looking set to complete his first three-figure score in limited-overs cricket, before being run out by Shakib Al Hasan while trying attempting a second run. Taylor took a backseat after Elton Chigumbura slammed 61 off 33 balls studded with five sixes and three fours. His fifty came off just 26 balls. Stuart Matsikenyeri made a nine-ball 23. Charles Coventry was run out for 22. Charles Coventry was run out for 22. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan grabbed 2-65 while Mahbubul Alam was expensive with 2-84 from nine overs. Syed Rasel took 1-59 Zimbabwe, put into bat, lost both openers cheaply. Mark Vermeulen was caught at midwicket by Mahmudullah Riyad for 10 off Mahbubul Alam in the fourth over after adding 11 runs for the second wicket with Hamilton Masakadza. The right-arm paceman also claimed Vusi Sibanda ( 0 ) after he was caught behind with the score on six off the fourth ball of the second over. The Tigers lead the five-match series 2-0 after winning the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs respectively. A win today will be their eighth in a row, which will be one short of their record best in ODIs. It will also ensure Shakib Al Hasan's men only their fourth overseas ODI series triumph. Earlier, Bangladesh trounced Kenya 3-0 in 2006, outplayed Zimbabwe 3-1 in 2006-07 and last month inflicted a three-nil whitewash over West Indies. Bangladesh made two changes with Junaed Siddique being replaced by Mehrab Hossain Jr and right-arm paceman Mahbubul Alam flying in to replace injured fellow pacer Rubel Hos
