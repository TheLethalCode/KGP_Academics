<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)Remittances by more than 7 million overseas workers are playing a vital role in nation building and could propel Bangladesh into the ranks of mid-income nations by 2021, the finance and labour ministers said at an award ceremony for remittance earners on Monday. "Nothing can slow the development and potential of a country with 7,500,000 overseas workers," said finance minister AMA Muhith at the Shonar Manush Shommanona 2009 awards ceremony. He said expatriates are "agents of change" playing an important role in rural development through investment in farming and livestock ventures, small-and-medium businesses and local hospitals and educational institutions in their home areas. Muhith pledged to take all necessary steps to solve expatriate workers' problems, saying "we will not neglect them". "Stay patient and be confident. We are trying to solve your problems," Muhith assured them. Also attending the event, labour and expatriates welfare minister Khandker Musharraf Hossain said sustained high remittances were a key factor in the nation's economic development. "We will become a mid-level income country by 2021 if remittances continue to rise," said Hossain. He said the government would also take measures to prevent unnecessary harassment at airports for returning overseas workers. Atiur Rahman, the Bangladesh Bank governor, termed the expatriates "national heroes", saying the impact of the global recession had been mitigated by remittances flowing into the country. 'Unsung heroes' Bangladesh's overseas workers, who remitted a record $9.6 billion or 12 percent of the country's total earnings in the last fiscal year, were also termed "heroes" at a Remittance Utshob, or Festival, earlier in the day, while the government was urged to properly evaluate the contribution of remittance earners to the economy. "These valuable remitters and our garments workers are the 'unsung heroes' of the economy," Dhaka University economics professor Wahiduddin Mahmud said, speaking as chief guest at the Utshob. But, Mahmud said, the lack of detailed data regarding their work abroad, their situation when they return home, utilisation of their remittance and poor regulation signaled that the government still regarded the valuable foreign currency earning sector as an 'informal' one. "The government only records how many people went abroad for work and the amount of remittance sent back in a year." He said, "Proper training and bank facilities should be provided before one leaves for work overseas, and rehabilitation and security for those who return being cheated or because of job loss." Mahmud also lauded the performance of banks in increasing remittance transfers in recent years by encouraging overseas workers to send back more earnings. Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Ziaul Hassan Siddiqui said, "The central bank is working to further ease money transfers and has approved joint ventures between small banks and NGOs to deliver remittance to the beneficiaries' door steps." He also asked BAIRA (Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies) to reduce fees for sending people abroad, as a recent World Bank report criticised the rates as "too high". Awards The Shonar Manush honours are organised by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The awards are given in categories for highest remittance, best remittance utilising family, grassroots bankers, migrant rights protection committees and recruiting agencies. This year's 'Highest Remittance' award winners were Abdul Halim Chowdhury from Comilla and Ruhul Amin from Keraniganj. Suraiya Yeasmin from Kalihati, Sobhan Mollah from Keraniganj and Mozaffar Alam from Chittagong received the 'Best Remittance Utilising Family' award. Three recruiting agencies, 11 bankers and three private organisations were also recognised for their significant performance in providing remittance services. The Remittance Utshob earlier in the day was also organised by RMMRU. Some 13 banks participated in the festival with BAIRA, BMET (Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training) and RMMRU also setting up stalls to deliver remittance related information to visitors. President of RMMRU Dr Tasneem Siddiui in her welcome speech urged the government to properly evaluate remittance earners' contribution to the economy. bdnews
