 Manikganj, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Tuesday said server stations will be constructed in 502 upazilas by next June to facilitate voter registrations. He visited the sites earmarked for construction of server stations across Manikganj district. Huda told reporters that the Union Parishad elections would be held in December or January after the Dhaka City Corporation polls and after the law made by the immediate past caretaker government was presented in the next parliamentary session and is endorsed for implementation. On the possibility of the EC stripping BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury of his parliament membership, the elections chief said Chowdhury was asked to submit his educational certificates, which he never supplied. The matter is simple and it should be resolved as soon as Chowdhury returns home from abroad. Huda visited Saturia server station location at 10:30am and was scheduled to visit Ghior, Shibalaya, Harirampur, Manikganj Sadar and Shingair upazilas. He was accompanied by Md Moazzem Hossain, project director, CSSED and Manikganj deputy commissioner GM Salehuddin. bdn
