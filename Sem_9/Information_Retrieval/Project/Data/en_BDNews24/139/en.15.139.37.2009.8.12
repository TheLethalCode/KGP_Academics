<TITLE> Govt to tighten screws on polybag makers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, August 11(bdnews24.com)Efforts to end the illegal use of non-biodegradable polythene bags in Bangladesh have been frustrated by a lack of manpower and dearth of dedicated mobile courts, say authorities, but the government is now set to take tougher measures against the continued production and spread of the environmental menace. "Delays in implementing the mobile court drive against the banned polythene bags is one of the main reasons behind their continued use," Muhammad Shahjahan Mia, technical director of the department of environment, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. In 2002, the government banned both production and use of 'thin' polythene bags of the type that are still widely found in shops and markets throughout Bangladesh. Mia said a recent government decision to kick-start mobile court drives, which have been stalled since the caretaker administration's separation of the judiciary in Nov 2007, would add much needed impetus to environmental protection initiatives. The DoE official's comments follow a recent call by the parliamentary standing committee on environment for tougher measures against the production and use of the illegal polybags. The committee, in a meeting held on Aug 6, said despite the ban on their manufacture and use, they continued to create environmental havoc in the capital and elsewhere by clogging water bodies and drainage systems. It found the polythene bags were partly responsible for exacerbating water-logging problems in Dhaka. However, retailers in the capital's kitchen markets say the cost of the plsatic bags remains considerably lower than that for net or paper bags, the two alternates promoted by the authorities. According to the committee's findings, polythene bags returned to the market in force towards the end of 2006. State minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, in the parliamentary committee meeting, said his ministry would strictly adhere to environmental legislation that banned the non-biodegradable bags. Alamgir Kabir, of environmental pressure group Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), told bdnews24.com that massive quantities of illegal polythene bags continue to be manufactured in small factories in Lalbagh, Hazaribagh, Kamrangirchar and Chakbazar. Kabir said some of the 'factories' have even secured fake DoE certificates to conduct their highly profitable business free from official hassles. Official confusion also persists over the exact types of plastic bag banned under the 2002 legislation. "It is difficult for the police to know which varieties of polythene bags are banned and which are approved," Lalbagh zone police deputy commissioner Anwar Hossain told bdnews 24.com. "We need a technical adviser on this issue," he said. A polythene bag manufacturer operating in the Lalbagh area of the capital, meanwhile, told bdnews24.com that he had been doing business for the last two years without encountering any intervention from authorities. bdne
