 GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Aug 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three Afghan soldiers and a foreign service member were killed when Taliban fighters ambushed a convoy in Afghanistan's east, the Defense Ministry and military officials said on Tuesday. Police in the area said as many as eight Afghan soldiers may have been killed after insurgents hit a convoy of Afghan and foreign troops with small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades on Monday.
