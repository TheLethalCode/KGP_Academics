 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has granted bail to two accused, Arif Hassan Sumon and Mofizur Rahman, in the murder and explosives cases filed in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, a lawyer said on Wednesday. Arif Hassan's lawyer, Aminul Goni Tito, said it was the first bail to be granted to any of the accused in the Aug 21 grenade attack cases. Speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain granted them bail on Wednesday and ordered the two to appear before their respective jails in their hometowns within one week. Arif Hassan is shown arrested in five other cases, his lawyer said. "Of the seven cases, he has secured bail in four cases so far," said Aminul. Mofizur Rahman's lawyer, Lutfor Rahman Sheikh, told bdnews24.com that there were also other cases against his client. At least 23 people were killed and scores of people were injured, including the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, in the deadly grenade attack on an AL rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier, Maolana Tajuddin, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The court on Aug 3 asked ordered further investigation into the 2004 grenade attack on a petition by state prosecutors.
