 LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England batsman Marcus Trescothick woke up in a cold sweat this week at the thought of a possible recall for the final Ashes Test against Australia at the Oval, he said Thursday. "There is a nightmare a lot of cricketers experience that they can't get their pads on when they are due in to bat," the 33-year-old Somerset player wrote in his column in the Bristol Evening Post. "My dream was a variation of that. I couldn't get my England kit out of my bag. The other players were waiting for me on the pitch to do a team photo so I was in a right panic. I woke up in a cold sweat." Trescothick has been touted for a possible recall at the Oval next week, with the series poised at 1-1, but he dismissed the idea.

Trescothick helped his country win the 2005 Ashes by racking up 431 runs and he is the top scorer in county cricket this year, with an average of 78.23. After playing 76 Tests and hitting 5,825 runs at an average of 43.79, the left-hander called time on his international career in March 2008 due to health problems. Trescothick had long suffered from a stress-related illness and had to pull out of England's 2006 tours to India and Australia. Another batsman being linked with an England call is Jonathan Trott, who scored 121 for Warwickshire against Nottinghamshire Thursday. Team-mate Ian Bell, recalled when Kevin Pietersen was ruled out of the series after sustaining an injury in the second Test, was 92 not out for Warwicks. Kent's Robert Key, another Oval contender, was out for 15 in the second innings against Northamptonshire while Surrey's in-form Mark Ramprakash hit 24 in a 40-over match against Glamorgan at the Oval Wednesday n
