 Dhaka, August 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court issued arrest warrants on Tuesday against five officials of Rid Pharmaceuticals Ltd, including its managing director, for production of adulterated and substandard drugs and their marketing. Dhaka drug court judge Md Golam Murtaza Mojumder issued the warrants against Rid Pharma MD Mizanur Rahman, directors Sheuli Rahman and Abdul Ghoni, and pharmacists Mahbubul Islam and Enamul Haque in a case that was filed by the Directorate of Drug Administration on Monday. DA supervisor Md Shafiqul Islam filed the case for illegal preparation of a paracetamol syrup suspected of causing the deaths of causing kidney failure and deaths of at least 25 children since the start of June. On July 21, the Drug Administration ordered Rid Pharma to halt manufacture and marketing of all its products, including the paracetamol preparation. On July 29, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical diethylene glycol in an illegal paracetamol syrup made by Rid Pharmaceutical Company that was suspected of killing at least 25 children in Bangladesh. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was allegedly used in the preparation as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol. Speaking to bdnews24.com last month, Prof Abu Sara Shamsur Rouf, of Dhaka University's pharmaceutical technology department, said that unscrupulous drug makers have been known to use ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as a solvent in certain paracetamol preparations instead of the approved propylene glycol. "These chemicals are cheaper, and smaller amounts of them are required to perform the same task," Rouf had said. Rid Pharma initially denied producing the paracetamol syrup linked to children's deaths in media reports. Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma "does not produce paracetamol syrup, only suspension". The health minister said on July 29 that although the product was described as a suspension on the package, it had in fact contained syrup. According to the health ministry, only five domestic companiesout of more than 250 big and small drug makers in the countryhave clearance to manufacture paracetamol syrup. DA officials say the market is flooded with substandard drugs, while lawyers of the drug court say authorities, including the DA, is failing to take proper legal action against the culprits. bdnews24
