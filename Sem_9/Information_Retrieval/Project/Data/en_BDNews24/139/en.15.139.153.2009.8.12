 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury in an outburst on Wednesday said "wheat thieves" had no right to cancel his parliamentary membership. He again termed any move by the Election Commission to revoke his candidacy, for not tender his educational qualification certificates, "unconstitutional". In an apparent reference to one or more of the election commissioners, he said, "No election engineer or 'wheat thief' has any power to cancel my membership in parliament." "Only the electorate of Chittagong-2 can take my seat away," he told reporters at a 'press conference' at his business offices in Mohakhali Asked about the High Court directives on the issue, he said, "The court gives directives in line with the constitution." Chowdhury said, "Three election engineers, who wanted to control the country's politics in the background of 1/11, also dirtied the elections." "There is nothing to be surprised at this initiative made by those who already engineered to bring down BNP's MPs to just 27." "I am not concerned over their initiative to cancel my membership in parliament. They have no power to do so." He also out that he would sue the election commissioners if they pursued cancelling his membership. "I will arrange to take the three election engineers, including the chief, to court," he said. b
