 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)Around 3,000 police were deployed in Dhaka on Thursday, ahead of National Mourning Day on August 15, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said. In view of potential militant and criminal activities, security has been beefed-up two days ahead of the mourning day, Haque said at a blood donation drive hosted by the metropolitan police in the city. Plain clothes police will also be operating in the city during the event, said Haque, who added that security would be coordinated with the intelligence agencies. He said important sites in the city are being kept under surveillance, and law enforcers had begun checking residential hotels, slum areas and transit hubs for anything out of the ordinary. Police patrols have also been upped and suspicious cars are being stopped and searched, he said. A Dhaka Metropolitan Police statement requested members of the public intending to visit the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmandi not to arouse any suspicions by carrying anything unusual. The day marks the death anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, known as Bangabandhu, who was assasinated along with family members on the day in 1975.
