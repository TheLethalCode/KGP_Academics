 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)The government will move to charge former shipping adviser MA Matin over irregularities in a container management deal at Chittagong port, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said on Thursday. Khan told bdnews24.com that he would follow the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping and refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission to charge the former adviser over "massive irregularities". Committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton told bdnews24.com earlier that they had submitted the recommendations to the shipping ministry the day before. The committee on July 30 said it would recommend that the shipping ministry ask the Anticorruption Commission to charge the former adviser, ex-shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar and take departmental actions against seven others. It said it would also recommend putting out the contract to tender again. Abdul Matin, a joint secretary, Sharif Masud, now an assistant secretary, and commodore R U Ahmed, who was made chairman of the Chittagong Port Authority on contract, are among those facing action. The standing committee unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found "massive irregularities" by the former adviser and the eight others on the last day of Matin's office on Jan 6 this year. Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, has maintained that he did nothing wrong. Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, has maintained that he did nothing wrong. The allegations Chowdhury's standing committee formed a three-member sub-committee on May 27 to investigate the allegations against Matin, who was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. Chowdhury, on July 30, told a press briefing, that the panel found that Matin had direct role in awarding a container deal to a company in violation of the government guidelines. Chowdhury said the tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. He said a false certificate was given in favour of Ishaq Brothers, a "novice" company, and the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. Chowdhury also said that acting shipping secretary Masud Elahi and senior assistant shipping secretary Sharif Mohammad Masud involved in the deal had confessed to the panel that Matin forced them to award the contract to Ishaq Brothers in violation of government rules. And the officials of the CPA submitted papers, which proved Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work, he added. Mohammed Shah Alam, who heads the sub-committee, had told bdnews24.com on July 26 that they had enough papers that pointed to Matin's involvement in the corruption and would not summon him to defend himself against the charges. Awami League's Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and the BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha are the other members of the probe body. bd
