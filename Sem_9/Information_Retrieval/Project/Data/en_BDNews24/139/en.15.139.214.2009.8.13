 CHASKA, Minnesota, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 91st US PGA Championship began in bright sunshine at Hazeltine National Golf Club on Thursday as four-time winner Tiger Woods prepared for an early teeoff. DJ Trahan ended up in the right fairway with the opening shot at the par-four first before being followed by fellow Americans Keith Dicciani and Briny Baird. World number one Woods, fresh from victory in his last two starts on the PGA Tour, was scheduled to start from the 10th hole at 0835 local time (2:45 pm British time). Woods, hunting his 15th major title but first this year, has been grouped with holder Padraig Harrington and 2002 champion Rich Beem for the first two rounds. Harrington clinched last year's PGA Championship by two shots at Oakland Hills in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan where Woods was a notable absentee while recovering from knee surgery. It was the Irishman's third major victory in six starts, following earlier successes at the British Open in 2007 and 2008. Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina was set to tee off from the first at 1335 (7:35 pm British time) with US Open winner Lucas Glover and British Open champion Stewart Cink. In other high-profile groups, twice champion Vijay Singh has been drawn with former winners Davis Love III and Steve Elkington while Phil Mickelson, the 2005 champion at Baltusrol, will play with fellow Americans David Toms and Paul Azinger. The PGA Championship has, in recent years, enjoyed the strongest field of the four majors and 98 of the world's top 100 players are chasing the season's final grand slam title this week. Weather forecasts expect conditions to remain warm and humid for the rest of the day with a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the after
