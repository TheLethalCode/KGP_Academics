 JERUSALEM Aug 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Human Rights Watch called on Israel on Thursday to investigate seven incidents in which it said Israeli troops shot dead Palestinian civilians who were flying white flags during the war in the Gaza Strip in January.

Thirteen Israelis, 10 soldiers and three civilians, died. Israel has rejected international criticism of an offensive it said was launched to curb rocket attacks on its towns by Hamas in Gaza. It says it is investigating allegations but has not yet found cause to prosecute any of its soldiers. Human Rights Watch, which said it had received no reply to detailed questions it sent the army, gave an account of an allegation that on January 7 a soldier shot dead two children. "Two women and three children ... were standing in front of their home after an Israeli soldier ordered them outside -- at least three of them holding pieces of white cloth -- when a soldier near a tank opened fire, killing two girls, ages 2 and 7, and wounding the third girl and their grandmother," it s
