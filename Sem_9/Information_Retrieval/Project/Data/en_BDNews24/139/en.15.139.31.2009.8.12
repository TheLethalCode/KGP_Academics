 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's Kaka got lost walking around Tallinn Tuesday ahead of their friendly against Estonia and needed a police escort back to the team's hotel, Brazilian media reported. The Real Madrid midfielder took an early morning walk around the old town on his own and was spotted by two policemen in a patrol car who stopped to talk to him. On learning Kaka had actually lost his way back to the hotel, the officers took him there in the patrol car, the press office of the city's police department said. Brazil play Estonia Wednesday in a warm-up for their World Cup qualifier against Argentina on September 5.
