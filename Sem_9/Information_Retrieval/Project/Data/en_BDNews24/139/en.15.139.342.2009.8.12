 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The UK government on Wednesday made an 18.5 million one-year commitment to BRAC's non-formal education programme. The agreement was signed between the country representative of the UK's Department for International Development Chris Austin and BRAC executive director of Dr Mahabub Hossain at the Uttar Korail BRAC Primary School in Gulshan's Korail slum, said a joint statement. Responding to a question as to why DfID was funding non-formal education, Chris Austin said, "There are two reasons for this, firstly there is a need and secondly because the system of funding for education delivers the results." Lauding the initiative by BRAC, he said costs were low and the output of education was similar to that from government run schools. He said, "I am accountable to the UK for every pound spent and therefore we need to ensure that there is no waste." "The results are good and the accountability is sharp," he said. Dr Mahabub Hossain said, "As part of an all inclusive education, our focus is on drop out students and those who have not gone to schools at all and though the infrastructure is not always top class, the standard of education is not compromised." "Working for the millennium development goal to achieve universal primary education, we provide an all inclusive, secular education and as a result the students are eager to learn," he added. Dr Mahabub Hossain also pointed to the fact that in a time of global recession, the fund from DfID would be 'extremely helpful' in sustaining the education programme. The fund will be used to provide support for the running of 30,000 pre-primary and 33,000 primary BRAC schools across the country and will benefit up to one million children. Part of the fund will also help strengthen the quality in primary and secondary schools, and the livelihoods and skill development training for adolescent and youth under BRAC's adolescent development and continuing education programme. Austin said DfID's support for education in Bangladesh also includes assiatance to the government through the Primary Education Development Programme II, support to skills development through the Underprivileged Children's Education Programme and English in Action.
