<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)The government's December review of the FY 2009-10 budget will see substantial reallocation of funds in various projects, the finance minister AMA Muhith said on Wednesday. At a dialogue on budget implementation, Muhith also said three major investment plans for energy, water-resources and ICT were high on the government's agenda. Touching on the major concerns of the government, he said uncertainty of power and energy "topped the list". Muhith was addressing a discussion on 'Implementation Challenges of the National Budget FY 2009-10', organised by private research body, Centre for Policy Dialogue, at the city's CIRDAP auditorium. He said the greatest task if implementing the budget was inspiring people in the administration, and tuning up administrative capability. "We are a little handicapped also when it comes to local government issues." He said other issues to address included the proportion of investment in the budget's newly introduced PPP (public-private partnership) initiatives. CPD fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya, in a presentation, said bottlenecks, like energy constraints, administrative barriers, land acquisition issue, law and order situation and effects of the global recession, would put pressure on implementing the budget. "To overcome these, steps should be taken to increase investment in the country." Former finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the budget's 6 percent growth target and implementation of a massive Tk 30,500 crore ADP would be "impossible" to achieve. He also came down hard on bureaucrats, saying: "Either they say what you want to hear or shift responsibilities to others." On the critical issue of land acquisition for public projects, Mirza Aziz said there was lack of advance preparation from the ministries on the matter. "This should be considered prior to preparing a project not after finalising it." He also said that 'recession funds' allocated for the budget's stimulus package under would be misused unless the government clarifies the objectives of the funds. CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan, in his concluding note, emphasizsd the role of media in implementing various projects of the government. "The media should do investigative reports on the development of various projects." He called on the media to obtain a list of development projects from the finance ministry and report on them on a regular basis. This would create a way for public accountability, said Sobhan.
