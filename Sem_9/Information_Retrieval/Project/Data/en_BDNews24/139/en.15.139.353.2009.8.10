 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)The initial public offering of Marico Bangladesh Limited, well known for its market leader Parachute Coconut Oil, closed on Monday, with subscription of more than six times the issue target. MBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Marico Limited India, is looking to raise around Tk 27 crore from the local capital market through the floatation of almost 3,000,000 shares. "According to our figures, in Dhaka and Chittagong alone Tk 180 crore worth of the subscriptions were submitted till yesterday (Aug 9)," Iqbal Chowdhury, the secretary of MBL, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The Securities and Exchange Commission last month cleared Marico to issue 1,492,100 ordinary shares, as the company sought initially to raise Tk 13.42 crore to repay outstanding loans of with several local commercial banks. The offer price of each share was fixed at Tk 90, with a face-value of Tk 10 and premium of Tk 80 created massive demand from investors when the subscription opened on Aug 2. On Aug 5, the market regulator agreed to double the size of the IPO, and extended its subscription deadline under a 'green shoe option', legally known as an over-allotment option, in which underwriters seek to stabilise the IPO. The scheme allows a company to float more shares than stated in the prospectus if oversubscribed, SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com last week. "They sought permission to increase their IPO against the backdrop of investors' appetite for the issue," said Bhuiyan. MBL began operating in 2000, with an authorised and paid-up capital of Tk 1 crore. Its flagship brand Parachute Coconut Oil now holds over 70 percent of the market share of branded coconut oils in Bangladesh. Over the last 8 years, the company has developed an annual growth rate of 37 percent in turnover. In the 2008 FY, MBL's turnover reached almost Tk 265 crore, from Tk 20 crore in the 2001 FY. In 2005, MBL expanded its foothold in the household soap sector, when it acquired the intellectual rights to well-known local brands, Camelia and Aromatic. It re-launched Aromatic under the name 'Aromatic Gold', but failed to gain traction against the major players, presently taking about 4 percent of the market. Parent company Marico Limited India is a global concern with business interests in manufacturing and retailing personal consumer products as well as providing services in the beauty industry. It also has subsidiaries in the Middle East and South Africa. bd
