 Gopalganj, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)Families of Bangladesh Rifles members arrested countrywide after the Peelkhana mutiny formed a human chain in Gopalganj on Monday demanding the release of innocent border guards and trial of the guilty. Organised by the relatives of the BDR members detained since the bloody BDR mutiny in February, the human chain was held on the road in front of the local press club from 10:30-11:00am. People from Gopalganj, Faridpur, Khulna, Jessore, Bagerhat and Barisal districts, including women and children of all ages, were seen waving placards inscribed with various demands. Afterward, the organisers submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister through the deputy commissioner. Over 2000 border guards have been detained countrywide since the bloody events of Feb 25-26 in which scores of army officers deputed to the border force were killed. bdnewsd24
