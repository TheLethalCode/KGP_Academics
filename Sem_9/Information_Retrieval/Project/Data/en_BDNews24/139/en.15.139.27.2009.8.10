 ROME, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham needs to return to Europe for the second half of next season to have any hope of playing at the World Cup, England manager Fabio Capello has said. "Beckham knows well that if he doesn't return to a big European championship in December he'll have no chance for the World Cup," Capello was quoted as saying by Monday's La Gazzetta dello Sport. The 34-year-old Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder won back his England place during a loan stint at Serie A AC Milan in the second half of last term.
