<TEXT>
 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)An exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the Second World War opens at the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms in central London at the end of this month. "Undercover: Life in Churchill's Bunker" will showcase the stories of those who worked underground in secret alongside Churchill and his War Cabinet, drawing on new personal accounts to build a picture of daily life beneath the London streets, where events of the war were being shaped and world-changing decisions made. The exhibition, running for a year from August 27, will present historic images, previously unseen personal objects and the voices of War Room veterans, combining to create the tense but often humorous atmosphere in the series of underground rooms selected as the secret war headquarters for Churchill and his War Cabinet. The Cabinet War Rooms were created in 1938, as the underground storage areas of the Office of Works Building in Whitehall were converted to house the central core of government and to become a military information centre, serving the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff of the air, naval and land forces. Intended as a temporary site, the rooms became operational on 27 August 1939, a week before the German invasion of Poland and Britain's declaration of war. This 'temporary' but timely measure served as the central shelter for government and military strategists for the next six years. Undercover begins with the days before the outbreak of war when the Cabinet was looking for a site for the War rooms, stretching forward to the 1980s when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher approved the plan to open the Rooms to the public and offering an insight into what it is like to work there today. It examines the safety and security of the Rooms and their ability to withstand a bomb blast, showing how Churchill operated, how people worked with him, and revealing how everybody coped with a daily underground existence. It also explores the emotions experienced by the group of workers once war was won and the bunker closed. Among the objects on display are a previously unseen letter registering Churchill's complaint that the War Rooms were not 'bomb proof' and that he felt that the War Cabinet had 'sold him a pup'; previously unseen wooden door signs, including one for Churchill's bedroom; staff passes demonstrating the levels of security in place; an original sun lamp box, used to give underground workers compulsory sun treatment; a spoof memo from a secretary urgently requesting stockings and other 'essential supplies'; the text of one of Churchill's major speeches made from the War Rooms, illustrating his famous and very deliberately spelt out oratory technique; never before displayed War Cabinet meeting notes kept by Assistant Secretary Lawrence Burgis against all rules; pencil doodles by Alanbrooke of colleagues during the overseas conferences attended by Cabinet War Rooms staff; and a fascinating, never before displayed letter revealing that the rooms were reused during the Suez Crisis. While the personality of Churchill looms large throughout, many uncelebrated characters are also brought to the fore, many of them secretaries or typists leading seemingly ordinary lives but involved in an extraordinary event. Muriel Cooper, who worked in the Key Points Intelligence Branch in the War Rooms from 1939-1944 recalls that "Churchill would say 'Don't take anything seriously, it's nothing personal'. There would be huge tension in his presence, but he always apologised for being brisk. I was so proud of the fact that I was able to serve even as a minor secretary to such a great man." Wendy Wallace: "You felt safedidn't even know the raid was on but one bomb would have knocked us to smithereens" Typist Myra Cooper: "We hated war, all of us did, but it made us grow up, it was our university." Cyril Rider, a despatch rider who delivered messages from the Cabinet war Rooms to Chequers: "It was important that no one go their hands on (the messages), they'd got to be delivered directly. I came to respect Churchill and the other blokes there." Elizabeth Norman of the Intelligence Section remembers: "After the first few weeks I always slept in my own bed and let fate take control. Somehow under very bad conditions we remained remarkably healthy on very little and very poor food, living and working deep underground by artificial light and no chance of real exercise." Ray Smith, a clerk for the Joint Planning Committee, remembers sleeping  but only when he had to  in the Dock: "It was filled with lots of iron beds, no air circulation at that level at all, very claustrophobic and not very conducive to a good night's sleep. One would wake up with a mouth like the bottom of a bird cage, and very few people chose to sleep there because it was so claustrophobic and unpleasant." Phil Reed, Director of the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, said "We are particularly pleased to be able to present the memories of the people who spent years of their life in the War Rooms." "The juxtaposition of often very ordinary preoccupations in the midst of utmost tension is striking." "The camaraderie of co-workers is clear, not to mention the unshakeable importance of glamour among the secretaries and typists." The subjects of the exhibition are a direct link to Churchill and enjoyed a significant and particular relationship with him, said R
