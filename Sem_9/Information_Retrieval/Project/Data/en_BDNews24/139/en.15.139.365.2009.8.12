 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Wednesday that continuance of a caretaker government system for holding general elections is "a political issue and on the part of the government to decide," while the Election Commission's main concern is voter security during polling. "It is possible to hold a fair election under a political government," Huda told reporters after opening a workshop titled '9th Parliamentary Election: A Critical Appraisal' on Wednesday. "But in the past we saw voters suffer from insecurity during elections under political governments." The main concern of election officials is to get logistical support from the administration and to ensure voters' security during polls, said the election chief. Huda said the EC is ready to hold elections under any administration if a free and fair poll and security of voters are ensured. "The Election Commission will give its opinion on the matter if asked." Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, on June 28, asked parliament to consider revoking the caretaker government system. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad and other MPs subsequently made the same proposal. 'Support the Electoral Process in Bangladesh', a project of the EC Secretariat, organised Wednesday's daylong workshop at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, attended by EC officials, election specialists, foreign diplomats and the national and international observer organisations of the 9th parliamentary polls held on Dec 29 last year. The CEC told the workshop that the commission "did not sit idle after holding a fair election". The EC was being further strengthened by filling manpower shortages, setting up countrywide server stations and forming a comprehensive database, said Huda. He said the commission also has plans to hold discussions with political parties over how to make the elections more accountable, reforms of electoral laws and updating voter lists. He also said the current government was not meddling in the commission's affairs. More work plans would be implemented during the term of the current commission, said the elections chief. The incumbent Election Commission has completed half of its five-year term. bde
