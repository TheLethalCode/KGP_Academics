 MELBOURNE, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With this year's Ashes series marked by sleep deprivation and frustration for many cricket fans Down Under, Australians rested easy on Sunday night after their team trounced England in the fourth test to level the series 1-1. Although delayed by a plucky tail-end stand by Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad, the win shortly after lunch at Headingley afforded time zone-disadvantaged Australians a luxurious night's rest. It also gave them time to enjoy the Monday morning papers' pithy analysis of the innings and 80-run victory sealed within three days. "Cop that!" snarled the back page headline of the Herald Sun newspaper, in which Shane Warne's beaming face declared the "Poms' spirits derailed by Aussie steam train" next to his column. "Ponting can see Ashes urn," the Australian newspaper declared, with one of the paper's staff keen to impart his own bent for clairvoyance. "Ricky Ponting is heading towards one of the greatest triumphs of his career by shoving England into the Ashes guillotine that Australia plunged into four years ago," he said. The Australian captain, who has been a target of taunting from English fans, said his team would enjoy the 10 days' break before the fifth and final test at the Oval. He may also personally enjoy some respite from media scrutiny over his bowling changes, after his four selected pacemen obliterated the English bats in both innings. "Australia's pace bowlers were superb. It's rare for every member of a quartet to be on top of his game," the Age newspaper gushed. LANGER STROKE Having blitzed England 5-0 at home in the previous series, Australia need only to draw the current edition to retain the Ashes, leaving the onus on England to force a win. As timely as the innings and 80-run victory in Leeds was for the new-look side's belief, former Australian batsman Justin Langer may be credited for another exquisite, if unorthodox, stroke of timing. A dossier penned by the gritty opener and given to the Australian team as food for thought prior to the series, cast the English side as flaky frontrunners all too easily cowed, has found its way into the British media. "Aggressive batting, running and body language will soon have them staring at their bootlaces rather than in the eyes of their opponent -- it is just how they are built," read excerpts reproduced in Australian papers on Monday. Having been forced out of their hotel beds prior to the first day of the fourth test by a fire alarm -- Australia fans claimed responsibility -- the English may be wondering what tomfoolery might befall them ahead of the final test. They can count on little sympathy if the Australians take Langer's message to heart. "They like being friendly and matey because it makes them feel comfortable," he wrote. "Take them out of their comfort zone and they don't like it for one second."
