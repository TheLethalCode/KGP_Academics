 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have kept faith in the same eleven that crushed Zimbabwe in the first match of the Grameenphone Cup series for Tuesday's second ODI at Bulawayo's Queens Sports Club. The match starts at 2:30pm Bangladesh time. TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television are going to telecast the game live. The Tigers chased down the target of 208 with eight wickets and 15.3 overs to spare with Mohammad Ashraful hitting a majestic unbeaten 103. "As I am no longer the captain therefore I have got to perform with the bat if I want to keep my place in the side. I did struggle in the Test series in the West Indies but got some runs in the ODIs. This innings would further boost my confidence," Ashraful was quoted as saying on TigerCricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "My team-mates, management, coaching staffeveryone backed me and encouraged me when I was not among the runs. They kept telling me that I would be rewarded for my hard work soon. I am really thankful to them," said Ashraful who became the first Bangladeshi batsman to reach 3,000 ODI runs during the course of his innings. The Tigers trained for nearly three hours at the Harare Sports Club on Monday. Teams: Bangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (capt) Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk/vice capt), Mahmudullah Riyad, Naeem Islam, Enamul Haque Jr, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain. Zimbabwe (probable): Prosper Utseya (capt), Hamilton Masakdaza, Mark Vermeulen, Sean Williams, Charles Coventry, Chamu Chibhabha, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura, Raymond Price, Ed Rains
