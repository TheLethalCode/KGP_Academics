 Mintu Chowdhury, bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, August 13 (bdnews24.com)Coordinated and thorough monitoring of kitchen market retailers is needed to control the price of essentials over Ramadan, a Chittagong businessman said on Thursday. "There are enough stocks for Ramadan and there is no reason for the prices of essentials to rise," Abul Bashar Chowdhury, senior vice-president of Khatunganj Businessmen's Association, told bdnews24.com. Commerce minister Faruk Khan recently visited the Khatunganj commercial area of the port city, one of the largest wholesale markets in the country, to talk with businessmen. Over the last three days, the price of sugar, soybeans, pulses, garlic and ginger have all increased in Chittagong retail markets, some by as much as Tk 5 per kilogram. Retailers and wholesalers seem to be pointing the finger at each other for the rise in prices. "Retail prices are increasing because of elevated wholesale market prices," said Mohammad Kamal, a retailer in Reazuddin market in the city. Retailers in the markets were also not seen displaying the wholesale and retail prices of their goods in defiance of a recent government directive. "Businessmen were told to hang price lists immediately," Chittagong deputy commissioner Farid Uddin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. He said a price list of 17 items, drawn up by the commerce ministry, was now being distributed to businessmen. bdnews
