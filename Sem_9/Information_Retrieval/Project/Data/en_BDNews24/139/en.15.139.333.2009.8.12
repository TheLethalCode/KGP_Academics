 WASHINGTON, Aug 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US trade deficit widened in June to $27.0 billion, as goods imports increased for the first time in 11 months on the back of higher oil prices, a Commerce Department report said on Wednesday. Analyst surveyed before the report had expected the monthly trade gap to widen to around $28.5 billion.

Higher oil prices accounted for much of increase, and imports of consumer products fell to the lowest since November 2005. The average price for imported oil rose for the fourth straight month to $59.17 per barrel, helping to widen the US trade gap with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to the highest since October 2008. US exports rose 2.0 percent in June to $125.8 billion, led by stronger foreign demand for industrial supplies and materials and capital goods. Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest since October 2008. The politically sensitive US trade gap with China widened to $18.43 billion, the largest with any single country.
