 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)Government hospitals in Bangladesh have been advised by IEDCR to prepare their outdoor patient wards for a potential influx of swine flu patients. The advice follows reports of an eighteenth fatality from the virus in India, with states there deciding to shut schools, malls and cinema halls and nearly a thousand people testing positive for the virus in the neighbouring country. "Doctors from Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Sir Salimullah Medical College hospital are now receiving additional training," Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "Training will be given serially to all doctors in the country," said Dr Rahman, who added that Bangladesh had good stocks of flu drug, Tamiflu. Two more cases of swine flu were also confirmed in Bangladesh on Thursday, taking the number of detected cases in the country to 36. According to IEDCR, 31 individuals infected with the H1N1 virus have now made a full recovery, while five more remain under surveillance. Twenty-four of the confirmed cases were infected overseas and the remainder contracted the virus within the country, according to the IEDCR. Dr Rahman said the newly confirmed cases were a mother and her child who had recently arrived in the country from Singapore. Screening measures were recently beefed-up in the country's 11 land ports, with India reporting fatalities and nearly a thousand confirmed cases. With the number of swine flu fatalities in India touching double figures on Tuesday, concerns are mounting. India is stocking up on Tamiflu, testing kits are being imported and private hospitals are being asked to help state-run hospitals cope with a surge in people rushing to get tested, say officials there. 'Hype' Some, however, feel that the media hype over swine flu is causing needless fear. On Tuesday, the Hindustan Times said the common flu could be killing an estimated 572 Indians every day, much more than H1N1 flu  which in most cases has been mild with most patients fully recovered. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. According to the World Health Organisation, as of Thursday, Aug 13, over 160,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with 1,154 recorded fatalities. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. bd
