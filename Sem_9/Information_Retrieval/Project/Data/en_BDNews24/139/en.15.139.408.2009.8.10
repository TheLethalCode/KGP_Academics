<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked Arafat Rahman Coco, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, and his lawyers to explain the forgery allegations against them after the government accused them last week of filing a petition with the court through fake power of attorney. Coco's petition to the High Court, filed on Aug 2, challenges a money laundering case against him filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year. The government filed a counter petition with the court three days later, on Aug 5, accusing Coco and his lawyers of producing a fake power of attorney in filing the petition. The government sought permission to file criminal cases against those who were involved with adopting illegal means in filing Coco's petition. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Monday asked Coco, his two lawyers, power of attorney Taherul Islam Touhid and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan to explain within three weeks why forgery charges should not be investigated. The court also stayed the hearing on Coco's petition. The same High Court bench is proceeding separately on Coco's petition that was filed on Aug 2 by Taherul Islam Touhid claiming power of attorney on behalf of Coco who is currently residing in Thailand. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court on Aug 5 that the proper official of the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand had not certified the power of attorney claimed by Touhid in the hearing of Coco's petition. Alam also said the power of attorney showed a false address. He accused Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokon of falsely attesting his client's signature on the alleged power of attorney. He said "it was clear" Coco did not authorise Touhid's signature and that the power of attorney was "a forged and fabricated document". Alam said it needs investigating and criminal charges should be filed. The ACC case against Coco, filed under the Money Laundering Act 2009, accuses him of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. Stay upheld on illegal wealth case In a separate development on Monday, the Appellate Division rejected a petition by the Anticorruption Commission seeking to appeal against a High Court stay order on proceedings of an illegal wealth case against Coco. b
