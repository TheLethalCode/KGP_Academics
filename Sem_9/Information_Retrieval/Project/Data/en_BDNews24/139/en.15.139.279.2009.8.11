 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)--Children of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani origin in the UK are 13 times more likely to have Type 2 diabetes than white children, according to one of Britain's leading health charities. Diabetes UK is the leading charity for the three million people in the UK with diabetes and was set up on Jan 10, 1934 by the novelist HG Wells, the author of The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds--and Dr RD Lawrence, both of whom had diabetes. The charity's aim is to ensure that everyone in the UK gains access to insulin, whatever their financial situation. The charity's report also revealed one person is diagnosed with diabetes every three minutes in the UK. The report "Diabetes in the UK 2009" is particularly worrying as Type 2 diabetes is usually only found in South Asian adults who are over 25. Type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in people of South Asian descent, according to the Department of Health in UK. British Heart Foundation statistics also revealed those who have diabetes are three times more likely to have heart diseasejust one of the devastating complications of diabetes. Douglas Smallwood, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: "It is very worrying that any child is developing Type 2 diabetes as it is usually only found in adults, but it is particularly alarming that South Asian children are at such high risk. "South Asian people are more likely to develop the condition and factors such as eating traditional foods high in salt and fat alongside western 'fast foods' compound their risk. "Type 2 diabetes is serious. It can lead to complications including heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, blindness and amputation. "It is a genetic condition but many cases are preventable through lifestyle changes, so Diabetes UK is working hard to raise awareness of the risk factors and symptoms to give people the best possible chance of reducing their risk of developing it," Smallwood added. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body does not produce enough insulin or is unable to use its insulin properly. Insulin, which is vital for life, is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps glucose to enter the cells where it is used as fuel for energy so people can work, play and generally live their lives. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include having a large waist or being overweight; being of Black or South Asian origin; having a family history of the condition; and being over 40 years old, or over 25 if Black or South Asian. Type 2 diabetes can be undetected for 10 years or more and around half of people already have complications by the time they are diagnosed. At risk waist measurements are 37 inches or more for men, except those of South Asian origin who are at risk at 35 inches or more, and 31.5 inches or more for all women. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes include increased thirst, going to the loo (for a wee) all the time  especially at night, extreme tiredness, blurred vision, genital itching or regular episodes of thrush, and slow healing of wounds.
