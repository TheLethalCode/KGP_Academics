<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will be aiming to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match GrameenPhone Cup when they take on Zimbabwe at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Friday. The match will start at 2:30pm (Bangladesh time) and TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television will telecast the game live. The Tigers are full of confidence after securing victories in the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs respectively. Another win for Shakib Al Hasan's men will ensure only their fourth overseas ODI series triumph. Earlier, Bangladesh trounced Kenya 3-0 in 2006, outplayed Zimbabwe 3-1 in 2006-07 and last month inflicted a three-nil whitewash on West Indies. A win at Bulawayo will be their eighth in a row, which will be one short of their record best in ODIs. The tourists will be looking towards Shakib Al Hasan again for inspiration. The world's number one all-rounder has certainly justified his credentials since assuming the captaincy from skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza who had to fly home from West Indies after injuring himself during the first Test. Shakib, the man-of the-match and series in West Indies, has proved himself a worthy leader and performer in Zimbabwe with ball and bat. He is now on a five-match unbeaten streak as captain. The talented left-hander scored his third ODI ton, (104 off 64 balls) the fastest by any Bangladeshi and the eighth quickest in limited-overs history, helping Bangladesh to win the second ODI against Zimbabwe. Their other key batsmen Mohammad Ashraful, who under-performed in the Caribbean, announced his return to form with a glorious century in the first match while openers Tamim Iqbal, with consecutive fifties, and Junaed Siddique have provided a perfect platform for the side on each occasion. In the absence of three leading bowlers, Mashrafe bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak and Rubel Hossain, Bangladesh's spinners have stepped up admirably in Zimbabwe. Spin accounted for five wickets in each of the first two games, with the host batsmen struggling especially against the slow stuff in the series opener. Two days before the third one-dayer, the Bangladesh cricketers took the opportunity to recuperate, according to TigerCricket.com. "There was swimming, recovery and massage. The boys stayed at the hotel and rested. They have been playing non-stop so this was a welcome break. Some of the boys have slight niggles and they had treatment," team operations manager Shafique-ul Haque Heera was quoted as saying. The Tigers returned to training Thursday afternoon to prepare for the game on Friday. Shakib was determined to maintain the momentum. "I believe we have been successful so far because we could keep our concentration going for the entire match. Also, we never allowed pressure to get to us. The boys are playing according to the game-plan and I attribute the results to team effort. The series is still open and that's why we just need to keep our focus and do our job in the middle," said Shakib. Regarding his own eye-catching form the 22-year-old felt attitude was the key. "I have seen that you have more chances of succeeding if you go into a game in a positive frame of mind. I have tried to be positive and it has worked for me so far," said Shakib. It is unlikely Bangladesh will make any changes.
