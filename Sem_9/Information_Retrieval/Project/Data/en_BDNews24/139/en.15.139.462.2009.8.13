The science and ICT ministry sent a letter to the foreign ministry last month, requesting the latter to ask for Thai financial assistance of almost Tk 500 crore to implement the three projects. The plan would see 'IT villages' established at the divisional level and 'Information Access Centres' introduced in every upazila as well as computer labs in educational institutions of each upazila. The projects aim to foster information technologies and boost the economic development of the country, the letter said.
