 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)Muggers killed a 29 year-old factory worker, after robbing him of Tk 450, in the capital's Shyamapur area in the early hours of Friday, police said. "Alamgir Hossain, a worker at Siddique Bazar shoe factory was returning to his Shyampur Balur Math home, when he was stopped by muggers in front of Shyampur Model School at about 4:30am," Kadamtali police chief Noor Hossain said. "The muggers took Tk 450 from his pocket and stabbed him in the throat." Alamgir's shrieks sent police and other people rushing to the spot. "But they were too late. Alamgir succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to hospital," said Hossain. "Perhaps Alamgir knew or recognised the muggers may, which may have prompted them to kill him after taking the money," the local police chief said. In another incident, police recovered the unidentified body of a woman, aged around 30, in a red kameez, early Friday from Dholai Khal in Jatrabarhi area. Sub-inspector Rahman of Jatrabarhi police said the woman might have been crushed under a speeding vehicle sometime during the night. Another crime victim, Abu Taleb, 45, succumbed to bullet wounds Friday morning at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He was admitted to DMCH Thursday night after being shot at Shiddhirganj in Narayanganj district. bdne
