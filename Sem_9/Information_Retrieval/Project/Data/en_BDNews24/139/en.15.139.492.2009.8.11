 CINCINNATI, Ohio, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former women's world number one Kim Clijsters surprised herself with her victorious comeback to tennis on Monday -- but not her fellow players. After a two-year break in which time she married and gave birth to her first child, the Belgian beat world number 13 Marion Bartoli of France 6-4, 6-3 to reach the second round of the Cincinnati Open. "I didn't really have any expectations," Clijsters told reporters. "I just wanted to go out there and play -- I guess my mindset was a bit different. "I think what I did well was even when my level was a little bit up and down, mentally I stayed focused. That's what I am really happy with." Bartoli was stunned by the standard of play that Clijsters produced. "Two years without playing a match -- it's pretty amazing the level she has already right now," she said.

"I think it's great. I think she's happy to be back and be here and I hope it goes really well for her," the American said. "I think she will do well, definitely. She's a great athlete and a great competitor." Former world number one Jelena Jankovic said it would be nice to have Clijsters back in the locker-room. "It's always nice to see a well-known face come back again," said the Serbian. "She was a great athlete and one of the best movers on tour. If she could be number one before, she can do it again." Clijsters plans to play in Toronto next week and the US Open at the end of the month before evaluating her progress and planning her sche
