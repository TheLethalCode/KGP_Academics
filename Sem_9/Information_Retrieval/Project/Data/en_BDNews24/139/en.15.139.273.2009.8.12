 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Mobile phone operator AKTEL has touched the benchmark of 10 million subscribers. "It is a great achievement in a short time. Now, AKTEL must go ahead and lower its call rate for subscribers," Hasanul Haq Inu, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on telecommunications, said at a gala night to celebrate the achievement at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Wednesday. "Ten million is a big number. The journey was never easy. We overcame a lot of problems," AKTEL chairman Yosof Annuar Yaacob said on the occasion. "But we have all through been committed to our subscribers. The number is not important, even if we have only one subscriber. The key factor is to ensure all customers are happy with us." AKTEL's chief executive officer Jefri Ahmed Tambi said, "When AKTEL started its operations, it had just 150 employee and 20 Base Tower Staions. Now we have 1,500 employees and 5,000 Base Stations," he said. "And tonight we are really proud. Ten million subscribers  is truly remarkable." AKTEL, a joint venture company between Axiata Malaysia and NTT DoCoMo Japan, officially commenced its operations in 1997 among the GSM mobile telecommunications providers in Bangladesh.
