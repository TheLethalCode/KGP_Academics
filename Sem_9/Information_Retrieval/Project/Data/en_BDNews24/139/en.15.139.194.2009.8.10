 Kushtia, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Kushtia police recovered three severed heads in front of the roads and highways district office on Monday. Kushtia police super Shahabuddin Khan told bdnews24.com they were discovered in a polythene bag by locals in front of the R&H office. Police recovered the bag containing the heads along with a slip of paper with 'JSD Ganobahini' written on it and a phone number. The number was 01199191089. They were able to identify the dead men only after recovering the bodies later in the day at Sonadanga field, said Sadar police chief Babul Uddin. The dead were identified as Quaiyum Hossain, 30, of Bhabanipur village, Aiyub Ali, 40, of Baruitupi village and 'Zoha', 38, of Bangshitala village. Before identification, police said they suspected the killings might have occurred in connection with a R&H tender feud. But Babul Uddin later said the deceased were known to be members of the banned extremist outfit Biplobi Communist Party, killed by rivals.
