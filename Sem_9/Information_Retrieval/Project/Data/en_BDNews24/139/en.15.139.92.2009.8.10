<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)Screening measures have been tightened at land ports in Bangladesh following reports of a sixth swine flu fatality in India, an IEDCR official said Monday. "We are intensifying screening at land ports in the wake of the deaths in India as many people travel between the two countries," Prof Mahmudur Rahman, president of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, told bdnews24.com. He said more officials stationed at land ports between India and Bangladesh are receiving training in a bid to check the pandemic. "The health authorities are also meeting twice a day to discuss the overall situation," said Prof Rahman. Indian media have reported sixth deaths to date from the H1N1 virus in India, and over six hundred infected, since the first fatality in the country was confirmed on Aug 4. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's Directorate General of Health Service has said it will ask the Uttara Modern Medical College Hospital to explain why they included the words 'Swine Flu' in a patient's death certificate on Saturday, Prof Rahman said. Both the IEDCR and the health ministry have said the deceased, one Sanwar Hossain, who returned from the Maldives on Saturday feeling unwell, had not died from swine flu as his case history did not match those of the virus. On Sunday, Prof Rahman said the patient had been suffering from a fever and respiratory problems, which can also be symptoms of swine flu. Sanwar was admitted to the hospital on Saturday afternoon and died at around 9pm. Director of Uttara Modern Medical College Hospital, Shahjahan Biswash, told bdnews24.com on Sunday that it had been a mistake to include the words 'Swine Flu' in the death certificate. The IEDCR has managed to confirm just 32 cases of swine flu in Bangladesh so far, almost all completely recovered. According to the World Health Organisation's latest figures, over 160,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with recorded fatalities jumping to 1,154. WHO declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bdne
