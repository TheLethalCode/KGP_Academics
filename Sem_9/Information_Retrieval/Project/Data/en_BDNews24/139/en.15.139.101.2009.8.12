 By Fahmida Wadud Chaity Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)What does a modern city or state need to have a truly international dimension, Sir John Tusa asked his full packed audience at the Mosaic International Summer School in Cambridge on July 22. His lecture stressed the importance of art in every aspect of life, from the personal to the civic to the national. Sir John, chairman of the Wigmore Hall Trust and chairman Court of Governors of the University of The Arts, London, and also vice chairman of the British Museum, was unequivocal in his belief that a vital function of modern day cities is to promote the arts. "A city can never be an international city without art components." Tusa spoke of Beijing's eagerness to build an opera house and arts centre ahead of the 2008 Olympics, because the Chinese knew its capital was incomplete without art components. The city opened the Xin Beijing Art Gallery in 2006 to promote contemporary Chinese and international artists. Hong Kong is planning to set up a major art centre in Kowloon, while Singapore already has an arts esplanade, said Tusa. He spoke too of recent meetings with officials of Saudi Arabia, who also want to include "intellectual components" in their oil rich state. "The British Museum is also working with the Abu Dhabi authorities." Having art components is not only vital for civic pride, said Tusa, art plays a role in the national and international spheres. If the British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Louvre Museum of Paris are in competition "that is the THE best kind of competition", he said. Tusa also believes contemporary art has turned from pure art experience into a "by accident" financial sector. "Investing in culture has become a new resource." He said the art industry generates income for many people and also boosts tourism and the national economy. Creative industries and contemporary art are very much related to each other. They have three important roles to play. First of all, appreciation of art. Secondly, the role as an industry. And the third is socio-educational." As an example of the latter, Tusa spoke of art centres throughout Brazil and how the nation used art, dance, music as an integrated part of social welfare. Sir John talked about art policy too. "National policy also impacts on the contemporary cultural establishment." "He said when art was dominated and regulated politically, or to serve an interest groupit always produced bad arts, the worst forms of arts." Sir John Tusa helped to lay the foundations of BBC World Service Television, has worked in all parts of the BBC over the last 50 years, during which time he won numerous awards including a BAFTA. He is a regular broadcaster, and has written books on broadcasting, arts policy, arts management and the nature of creativity.
