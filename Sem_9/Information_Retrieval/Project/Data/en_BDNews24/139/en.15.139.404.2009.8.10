 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty has said the right to information law will contribute to Bangladesh's democratic strides. "The media in Bangladeshbe it print, electronic or onlineis dynamic and vibrant. It has become a building block in the country's continuing democratic development," said Moriarty before launching a training programme on "Ethic and Standards in Journalism" in the city on Monday. "Another important building block fell into place with the recent passage of the Right to Information Act of 2009. "...I hope that the citizens and institutions of Bangladesh, especially the media, will make good use of this important act to further enrich democracy in this country," he said. The new right to information law was passed in the second session of the ninth parliament with almost the same content as the Right to Information Ordinance promulgated by the immediate past caretaker government. The Bangladesh public and media have faced almost impossible odds in securing information from the government offices in the past. The right to information act aims to correct this. Monday's training programme was organised by Journalism Training and Research Initiative (JATRI), a body of the Institute of Governance Studies of BRAC University. Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, pro-vice chancellor of the university, Dr Manzoor Hasan, director of the university's Institute of Governance Studies, and journalist Zaglul Ahmed Chowdhury also addressed the opening session.
