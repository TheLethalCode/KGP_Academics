 YANGON Aug 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trial of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is to resume on Tuesday amid heightened security around the prison where the hearing will take place. Her legal team said the hearing had been set for 10 a.m. (0330 GMT). If she is found guilty on security charges, as widely expected, the long-time leader of the pro-democracy movement in army-ruled Myanmar faces five years in prison. She has spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention of one sort or another. Witnesses said at least 2,000 security personnel were in the vicinity of Insein Prison, where she is being held and tried. State newspapers all ran the same commentary on Tuesday that implicitly warned Suu Kyi's supporters not to cause trouble and told outsiders not to meddle in Myanmar's affairs.

Critics say the trial has been trumped up by the military government as a way of keeping Suu Kyi out of circulation in the run-up to and during a multi-party election planned for 2010. The case stems from a bizarre incident in which an American, John Yettaw, swam to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May. The prosecution says Yettaw's two-day stay at Suu Kyi's home, even though he was uninvited, meant she breached the terms of her house arrest and violated an internal security law. A verdict in the trial had been expected on August 4 but the judge adjourned the case until Tuesday, August 11, after Yettaw fell ill. However, he was moved back to his prison cell shortly before midnight on Monday, a hospital source said. Yettaw, 54, from Missouri, is on trial alongside Suu Kyi and two of her housemaids. He is charged with immigration offences and for swimming in a non-swimming area. Yettaw, a Mormon, has told the court God sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by "terroris
