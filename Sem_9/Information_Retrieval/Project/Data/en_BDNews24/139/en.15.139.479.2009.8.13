 ROME, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan are keen to take David Beckham back on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy in January, the England midfielder's spokesman said Wednesday. "Milan have publicly expressed an interest in taking David on a loan move similar to this year but there is no further news to add at this stage," the spokesman told Reuters by email. Beckham won back his England place during a loan stint at the Serie A club in the second half of last term. England manager Fabio Capello has said he must return to Europe to have any hope of playing at the 2010 World Cup.
