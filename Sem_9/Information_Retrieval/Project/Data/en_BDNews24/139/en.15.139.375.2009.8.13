 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  US president Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest US civilian honour, to 16 agents of global change on Wednesday, including Bangladeshi economist and microcredit pioneer Mohammed Yunus, South African anti-apartheid veteran Desmond Tutu and British physicist Stephen Hawking. Nobel laureate Yunus, self-described 'Banker to the Poor', broke new ground with micro-loans to the poor, now replicated worldwide. Yunus, an economist by training, founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983, which has since disbursed over $8 billion. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work. Handing Yunus the Medal of Freedom, Obama said: "Thirty-five years ago, a young economics professor at a university in Bangladesh was struck by the disconnect between the theories he was teaching in class and the reality of the famine outside." "Mohammed Yunus was just trying to help a village, but he somehow managed to change the world," said Obama. At the start of his address, Obama thanked the "agents of change" and "finest citizens" of his country and other countries. "The recipients of the Medal of Freedom did not set out to win this or any other award. They did not set out in pursuit of glory or fame or riches. Rather, they set out, guided by passion, committed to hard work, aided by persistence, often with few advantages but the gifts, grace, and good name God gave them," the US president said. US's highest civilian honour is awarded for "especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours". Stephen Hawking is an internationally recognised theoretical physicist who has a severe physical disability due to motor neuron disease. Awarding the medal to Hawking, Obama said, ""From his wheelchair, he's led us on a journey to the farthest and strangest reaches of the cosmos. In so doing, he has stirred our imagination and shown us the power of the human spirit here on Earth." Desmond Tutu, widely regarded as "South Africa's moral conscience," led a formidable crusade in support of justice and racial reconciliation in South Africa. He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 1984. Other figures to receive the Medal were Mary Robinson, Ireland's first woman president, who left the presidency early to serve as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights; Sidney Poitier, the first African-American to be nominated for and win a Best Actor Academy Award; and Senator Edward Kennedy, who has served in the US Senate for nearly 50 years, a career dedicated to "fighting for equal opportunity, fairness and justice for all Americans. Obama's selection of Robinson to receive the medal sparked anger among some pro-Israel lobby groups, who accused her of bias against the Jewish state. But Obama described the former United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights as an "advocate for the hungry and the hunted." Poitier, the president said, had not only entertained, but shifted racial attitudes, broadened hearts and brought Americans together. Senator Edward Kennedy, who is battling brain cancer, was missing from the ceremony, and was represented by his daughter Kara. "The life of Senator Edward M. Kennedy has made a difference for us all," Obama said. Harvey Milk, the first openly gay official of a major US city; Pedro Jose Greer, an academic and doctor who works extensively with the poor in Miami, Florida; and the last living Plains Indian war chief, Joseph Medicine Crow, whose books preserve the history and culture of Native Americans were also honoured on Wednesday. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman justice on the US Supreme Court, US geneticist Janet Davison Rowley, whose studies of chromosome abnormalities in human leukemia and lymphoma have led to dramatically improved survival rates for previously incurable cancers, Nancy Goodman Brinker, who founded the global breast cancer grassroots organisation Susan G Komen for the Cure in memory of her sister, former tennis pro Billie Jean King, who became the first woman commissioner in professional sport after her court career ended; and Latina actress, dancer and singer Chita Rivera rounded out the list of women recipients
