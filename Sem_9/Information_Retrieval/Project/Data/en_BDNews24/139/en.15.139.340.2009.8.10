 CHENNAI, India, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has cleared Pakistan players of coming in contact with bookmakers on their recent tour of Sri Lanka. The ICC said in a statement Monday it was satisfied "no evidence of any such contacts exists" after its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit held an investigation following media reports that the visitors had been approached. "I am pleased those investigations have indicated nothing untoward has taken place on this occasion but it is a reminder that all of us... must maintain our vigilance to ensure we remain on top of the issue of corruption," ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. The Pakistan Cricket Board informed ICC that it suspected bookmakers were staying on the same floor as their players in the team hotel in Colombo after the tourists lost the test series 2-0 and had lost the first three games of their five-match, one-day series. Pakistan pulled back to win the final two one-dayers.
