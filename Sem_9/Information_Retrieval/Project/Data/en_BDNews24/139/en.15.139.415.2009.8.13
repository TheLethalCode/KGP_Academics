 CISHAN, Taiwan, Aug 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure mounted on Taiwan's government on Thursday to speed up operations to rescue hundreds of residents of remote mountainous villages buried or stranded in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot. The official death toll in Taiwan stood at 108 after the worst floods in decades washed out roads, sent dwellings crashing into rivers and forced authorities to deploy hundreds of helicopters for rescue missions. The storm has badly damaged infrastructure in Taiwan's south, a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, and will likely worsen already bleak forecasts for third quarter economic contraction.

They don't care about the south. They just care about the north," said Chen Fu-rong, head of a funeral association in Kaohsiung, as she stood alongside bodies of victims. The military has deployed more than 34,000 personnel and 382 helicopters, it said on its website (www.mnd.gov.tw). Ma and top government officials have been touring affected areas. "The disaster is huge and many bridges were smashed. Vast numbers of people have been affected and the weather has been very bad," said Tseng Ching-liang, an army colonel in Cishan. Helicopters have frequently been reduced to hovering over devastated areas and throwing down thick ropes to hoist stranded villagers to safety. Bad weather has made even such operations difficult. One helicopter crashed into mountainous terrain earlier this week, killing its c
