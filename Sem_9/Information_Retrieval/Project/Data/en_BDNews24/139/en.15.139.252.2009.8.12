 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni is likely to visit India in the first week of September to discuss bilateral issues. "Possibly, I will visit India first week of next month," Dipu Moni told bdnews24.com Wednesday at the foreign ministry. She said a detailed itinerary of the visit was yet to be finalised. "But I will be discussing all bilateral issues, including the huge trade deficit and water related matters, with Indian leaders," she said. The Bangladesh-India bilateral trade volume stands at around $3.35 billion, according to commerce ministry sources. The trade is huge, with India's exports totaling over $3 billion, while Bangladesh's make up just $350 million. Foreign ministry officials say India has proposed holding the next meeting of the joint working group on Bangladesh-India trade by the end of August. But the date is yet to be fixed, an official told bdnews24.com. Reagrding water issues, India's planned Tipaimukh Dam project has sparked fierce debate in the region and elsewhere, with particular fears being raised in Bangladesh about the adverse environmental impact it may have on downstream areas. As concerns grow that Bangladesh may not be able protect its own interests against a more powerful neighbour, India has several times assured Bangladesh that New Delhi would not act against Dhaka's interests. Most recently a Bangladeshi parliamentary delegation visited India, returning earlier this month with renewed assurances from the Indian government. Meanwhile, Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty and his deputy saw foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes at his foreign ministry office Wednesday to discuss Dipu Moni's upcoming visit. The high commissioner did not talk to press saying, "This was a routine meeting".
