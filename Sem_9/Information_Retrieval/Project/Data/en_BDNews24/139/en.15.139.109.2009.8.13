 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)The government will move to charge former shipping adviser MA Matin over alleged irregularities in a container handling deal at Chittagong port, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said on Thursday. Khan told bdnews24.com that his ministry would follow the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping and refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission to press charges against Matin over the "massive irregularities" in awarding a contract to Esack Brothers on the former adviser's last day in office on Jan 6 this year. Committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com earlier in the day that they had submitted the recommendations to the shipping ministry on Wednesday. Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, has maintained all along that he did nothing wrong. Chowdhury's standing committee formed a three-member sub-committee on May 27 to investigate the allegations against Matin, who was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. Chowdhury presented the findings of the probe body at a press conference at the parliament building on Thursday. Chowdhury told bdnews24.com before the press conference, "The committee has recommended the ministry refers the irregularities to the Anticorruption Commission to file a case against former adviser MA Matin, former shipping secretary Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain and six other public servants." "The committee has also suggested taking departmental actions against the public servants involved in the dealing." "Besides, we have asked the ministry to realise Tk 8 crore from them for causing loss to the public exchequer," he said. Chowdhury said the committee also suggested cancelling the contract with Esack Brothers. The allegations Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the parliamentary probe body had found Matin had a direct role in awarding a container deal to a company in violation of the government guidelines. Chowdhury said the tender was not invited in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. He said a false certificate was given in favour of Esack Brothers, a "novice" company, and the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. Chowdhury also said that shipping officials involved in the deal had confessed to the panel that Matin forced them to award the contract in violation of government rules. Mohammed Shah Alam, who heads the sub-committee, told bdnews24.com that they had enough papers that pointed to Matin's involvement in the corruption and had therefore not summoned the former adviser to defend himself against the charges. AL's Shamsul Haq and Nazrul Islam Babu and BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha were the other members of the all-party parliamentary probe body. The evidence Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that according to the probe report, the tender evaluation committee chief Jobayer Ahmad had been in Dhaka on leave in early January "to avoid awarding the contract to Esack Brothers which had no experience in container handling work". "The chairman of Chittagong Port Authority sent traffic manager Omar Faruq, who flew to Dhaka by air, to get Jobayer's signature on the tender document." Chowdhury, quoting a written statement by Jobayer, said, "On January 5, 2009, the chairman of Chittagong Port Commodore RU Ahmed told Jobayer by telephone that there was pressures from the adviser (Matin) and the secretary (Motahar) for awarding the work before the elected government took office (on Jan 6)." The standing committee chairman said the adviser cancelled a tender in which Everest Enterprise was the lowest bidder. But the port authority floated a "re-tender" at the behest of adviser Matin. "As per the public procurement rules, 2003, none can change the terms and conditions of the previous tender in case of re-tender. "Instructed by the adviser, the ministry changed tender papers in 14 sections of the previous tender just to award the contract to Esack Brothers," said Chowdhury. The sub-committee's probe found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA moved the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Esack Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the sub-committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning, and the same was sent to the port authority for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the port authority awarded the work to Esack Brothers at 9am as the new government was being sworn in at Bangabhaban. Chowdhury, however, maintained that the probe body had not found any proof of the adviser taking bribes. Accused officials Besides Matin, the other accused officials are Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain, former shipping secretary (now working as a member of the privatisation commission), Abdul Matin, former joint-secretary to shipping ministry (now posted as joint secretary to industries ministry), Sharif Md Masud, former senior assistant secretary (now posted as senior assistant secretary at agriculture ministry), Commodore R U Ahmed, chairman of Chittagong Port Authority, Md Harun Mia, Chittagong Port Authority Member (finance), Ehsanul Kabir, Chittagong Port Authority director (transport), Golam Sarwar, Chittagong Port Authority's deputy traffic manager (ICD) and K M Moazzem Hossain, Chittagong Port Authority's deputy traffic manager (administration). Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges after the Awami League government took office. Housing and public works adviser Moinul Hosein has since come under parliamentary scrutiny for allegedly awarding public land to his wife and son in violation of government rules.
