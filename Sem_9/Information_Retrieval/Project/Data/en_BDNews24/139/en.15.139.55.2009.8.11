<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The wholesale and retail price of essentials in all markets throughout the country are to be displayed side-by-side over Ramadan for the first time, commerce minister Faruk Khan said on Tuesday. "Displaying the two prices together will help shoppers appreciate wholesale price fluctuations and their impact on retail costs," Faruk told reporters following a meeting with the Australian high commissioner at a Dhaka hotel. Sufficient amounts of essential goods have also been stockpiled to meet demand over Ramadan, Faruk said, adding that this should mean the price of essentials remained under control this year. "The district commissioners have been asked to check the price of essentials in the wholesale and retail markets, the information will reach us in a few days," said Faruk. He said government officials will supervise the markets over Ramadan to ensure essential commodities are sold at reasonable rates and in line with the prices gathered by the district commissioners. Faruk said dishonest businessmen regularly profiteered on increased consumer demand over the Ramadan period. He also said sales of essentials through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh will start ahead of Ramadan. Anisul Huq, the president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI), who also attended the meeting, said market fluctuations were fundamentally an issue of supply and demand. "But it is unfortunate that many retailers, wholesalers and distributors as well as certain producers take advantage of elevated demand when Ramadan arrives," said Anisul. He said unscrupulous market operators hike the prices of essential commodities by stockpiling goods and releasing them when the market conditions were most favourable. "Supervision of the market by government agencies and the business community is insufficient," said Anisul. He said the government was now sincere in its attempts to control market prices
