<TEXT>
 Pirojpur, August 12 (bdnews24.com) - The son of a freedom fighter has filed a war crimes case against Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi and four others, accusing them of killing, arson and looting during Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971. Malik Pashari, son of late freedom fighter Saijuddin Pashari of Chitholia village in Pirojpur Sadar Upazila, submitted the allegations to the district's chief judicial magistrate's court on Wednesday. The court ordered Pirojpur police to register the case. Other accused are Momin Howlader, Hakim Kari and Md Sobhan of Gazipur village of Sadar Upazila, and Md Mohsin of Southkhali village in Zia Nagar Upazila. Southkhali is also the village home of Sayeedi, who was barred by the government from leaving the country last month. Pashari accuses the five of shooting dead the caretaker of his father's house, Ibrahim Howlader, burning down the house worth Tk 10 lakh and looting household property worth Tk 50,000 during the 1971 war. Malik Pashari has registered himself as an eye witness in the case. Sayeedi travel bar upheld on govt petition Earlier in the day, in Dhaka, the Appellate Division upheld the government's 'travel bar' on Sayeedi, just two hours after a High Court ruling declared the government's refusal to allow him to board an overseas flight "illegal". Immigration officers at Zia International Airport stopped Sayeedi from boarding a plane to Saudi Arabia on July 24. Sayeedi filed a petition on July 27 challenging the government's actions. On Aug 2, the High Court had asked the government to explain why its refusal to allow Sayeedi to travel abroad should not be declared illegal. On Wednesday, a High Court bench of justices Tariq-ul-Hakim and Borhan Uddin ruled the government's actions illegal. Following the ruling at around noon, barrister Abdur Razzaque, counsel for Sayeedi, told reporters that justice had prevailed and the judgement showed that the state could not interfere in the constitutional rights of a citizen without legal precedent. The government, however, immediately petitioned the appeals court for a stay on the High Court judgement. Appellate Division chamber justice Md Mozammel Hossain stayed the High Court ruling at around 2:30pm. A full hearing on the government's petition will take place on Aug 18. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam stood for the government in the High Court hearing. bdnews24.com/c
