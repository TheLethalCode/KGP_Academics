 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)The government is likely to form a joint-body comprising berth operators and officials of the Chittagong Port Authority to handle containers at the Chittagong Container Terminal in case of failure to appoint an operator, the shipping minister said on Thursday. "The government is considering the option as current CCT operator SaifPowerTech's contract expires on Aug 15," Shajahan Khan, the minister, told bdnews24.com. The parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry has also recommended cancelling a deal with Esack Brothers, who secured a container deal contract by "irregular" means, said Khan. "We cannot ask SaifPowerTech to continue the work for an uncertain period as the operator will charge Tk 165 more for each container than Esack Brothers did," he said. "The port handles more than 2000 containers daily," he said. "So, SaifPowerTech will cost the public more money than Esack Brothers did," Khan said. He said his ministry would honour the parliamentary standing committee's recommendation to the ministry to cancel the contract with Esack Brothers, allegedly a "novice company". According to the contract, Esack Brothers would charge Tk 340 per container. "It would be unfair to allow Esack Brothers to handle the containers," the minister said. "Given the circumstances, we are thinking of forming a joint committee comprising port officials and the berth operators to handle containers as an interim measure," Khan said. Khan said a port official would head the committee. "Of course, I will seek legal advice on the move and if necessary I will also seek prime minister Sheikh Hasina's opinions to solve the problem," said Khan. The minister said he had already held preliminary talks with the berth operators, but they had not raised the issue of charges yet. Md Sarwar Hossain Sagor, senior vice-president of Bangladesh Masters Stevedors' Association (BMSA), the berth operators' organisation, told bdnews24.com that they were ready to handle containers if asked to. "As the berth operators, we used to handle containers prior to the 1/11 changeover," said Sagor. "We are completely ready to handle containers if asked to," he said. Sagor said in June this year the association sent a letter to the ministry expressing their readiness to handle the containers. "The rate would be negotiable." "But I can assure you that it will be less than what SaifPowerTech is asking," said Sagor. On May 27, the parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry formed a four-member probe body to investigate alleged irregularities in awarding container handling operations at Chittagong Port. The probe body concluded that Esack Brothers had no experience in container handling and secured the work through an irregular deal by former shipping adviser MA Matin. The committee therefore asked the ministry to scrap the deal with Esack Brothers. b
