<TITLE> Slow poverty reduction displeases Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Augt 11 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith Tuesday expressed displeasure at Bangladesh's slow progress with regard to alleviating poverty as it lags behind others in the national human resource development indices. At a seminar titled 'Micro credit: interest rates and transparency' organised by Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, Muhith said efforts should be on to find the root causes or any strategic faults associated with such failure. "In the past few years, Bangladesh has progressed considerably as regards human resource development, but our advancement in poverty reduction hasn't been up to the mark," said the finance minister. "It's really hard to foretell how long we'll have to fight poverty. It may very well be a 10 or even 20 years' war. "Microcredit is a major combat weapon used in our battle against poverty. The NGOs claim that 30 million Bangladeshis have access to microcredit today. "Since we have over 70 million poor people fighting to come out of the poverty cycle, we need to review the overall microcredit situation and determine why the poor in greater numbers are not being able to access the poverty alleviation opportunities." On the varying and rather high interest rates, he said, "Many raise questions about the interest rates slapped by the microcredit organisations. Grameen Bank has reduced its lending interest rates." "The more the NGOs will be expanding their credit programmes, the lower their lending interest rates should be. "The NGOs still look rather weak and shy about utilising the IT facilities and services available. They have to rethink the issue seriously and urgently." He said clients take loans from one organisation to repay their debts with another. "This has to be monitored and coordinated through setting up a proper controlling office." Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, PKSF chairman and former caretaker government adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud and PKSF managing director Quazi Mesbahuddin Ahmed also spoke at the seminar. bdnew
