<TITLE> KL says it will lift Bangladeshi workers ban once crisis eases </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has once again told Dhaka that it will lift a ban on visas for Bangladeshi workers, but only after the Southeast Asian nation overcomes its own economic crises caused by the global recession. The statement came Wednesday as Malaysian high commissioner Jamaluddin Bin Sabeh called on foreign minister Dipu Moni at her office. Neither the foreign minister nor the high commissioner spoke to waiting reporters after the meeting. The Malaysian government on March 10 this year cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers because of a "politically sensitive" statement made by a Bangladeshi diplomat. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, whom the high commissioner met before calling on Dipu Moni, told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "I raised the issue of waiver of the visa ban." "The high commissioner reassured us that the visa ban will be lifted as soon as Malaysia overcomes its own economic crises." Quayes said the Malaysian prime minister, at a sideline meeting at the July 14-16 NAM summit in Egypt, assured prime minister Sheikh Hasina that the ban would be lifted. But Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Anifah Aman on July 23 told Dipu Moni at the sideline of the 16th ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Thailand that his government was maintaining the embargo on Bangladeshi workers. Aman said it would be lifted only after the recovery of Malaysian economic crises caused by the global financial meltdown. Around 500,000 Bangladeshis live and work in Malaysia. Bangladesh labour counsellor Talat Mahmud told a Malaysian TV channel last year that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs in Malaysia despite the economic slowdown. The counsellor told the same to Malaysia's state-run news agency, angering people and politicians in Malaysia, hard hit by the global economic meltdown. The far-eastern country subsequently sent back tens of thousands of Bangladeshis applying for work visas empty-handed. The Bangladesh labour counsellor was later withdrawn.
