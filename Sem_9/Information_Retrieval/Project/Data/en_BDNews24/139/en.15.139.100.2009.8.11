 NEW DELHI, Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A quarter of India's districts are facing the threat of drought and sowing of crops are 20 percent lower than the previous year, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said on Tuesday. India is heavily dependent on the June to September monsoon rains for farm output, to help rural income and to drive economic growth. After the driest June in 83 years, the annual rains have been more than a quarter below below normal this season. "Monsoon situation is still erratic," Mukherjee told reporters.

It has already stepped up efforts to buy more sugar and has banned wheat exports and restricted rice shipments. "Fortunately, Punjab and Haryana have extensively used the ground water.

Asia's third largest economy expanded 6.7 percent in the last fiscal year, sharply lower than the 9 percent or more it grew in the previous three years, as the global economic crisis took a toll. Mukherjee was also confident that direct tax receipts for the 2009/10 fiscal year would be surpas
