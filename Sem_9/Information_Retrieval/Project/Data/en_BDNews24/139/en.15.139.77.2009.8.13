<TITLE> Nadal return match ends with Ferrer retirement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MONTREAL, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal's first singles match after a lengthy injury lay-off ended abruptly on Wednesday when the Spaniard's Davis Cup team mate David Ferrer retired hurt during their second round encounter at the Montreal Masters. With Nadal leading 4-3 in the opening set and having just broken his opponent for the second time, Ferrer calmly walked over to the chair umpire and said he could not continue after aggravating a left knee injury. Ferrer had shown no signs of distress and in fact had dominated stretches of the match. "I had problems with my knee, I cannot play," Ferrer told reporters. "I've had the problem since before Wimbledon and I want to take some treatment. "I don't think (the injury is serious), I think next week I will play." Sidelined for more than two months with tendonitis in both knees, Nadal was playing his first competitive singles match since being knocked out in the fourth round of the French Open in May. Ferrer's retirement puts Nadal into the third round, where he will face Philipp Petzschner of Germany.
