 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)Is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton overworked and tired? Is she getting increasingly frustrated over being upstaged by her charming husband? Is there a fresh rift in their state of marriage? All these questions are being bandied about even before she arrived back home on Friday from her 11-day seven-nation grueling trip to Africa intended to reaffirm the new Obama administration's commitment toward strengthening America's ties to some of its most strategic allies in the troubled region. The trip seemed to have gone off well with a lot of positive media coverage until she arrived in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, last Monday, where a brief encounter with a Congolese student seemed to overshadow her entire trip. Mrs. Clinton was onstage in Kinshasa, the capital, in a town hall-type setting when the student asked: "Mrs. Clinton, we've all heard about the Chinese contracts in this country ... The interference is from the World Bank against this contract. What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton?" Her angry response to the question quickly became a fodder for the hungry 24-hour cable TV, which played the episode over and over again, raising subtle questions about why she reacted in such a manner and what really unleashed her pent up anger. This is how she answered the question: "Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." Her evident irritation at the question quickly fueled speculation that Mrs. Clinton felt eclipsed by Bill Clinton's recent trip to North Korea, in which he rapidly secured the release of two American journalists who had been sentenced to years of hard labor on charges of illegally entering the country. After the forum, her aides told the traveling press corps that there might have been a mistranslation, and that the student actually wanted to know the opinion of her boss, not her husband. But that interpretation did not dispel the controversy either, since it gave new life to the nagging question of whether Mrs. Clinton felt marginalized in the Obama administration. Her unusual reaction also prompted some well-known columnists to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the most famous couple to further the cause of the Obama administration's foreign policy initiative. "This raw, competitive response showed that the experiment in using the Clintons as a tandem team on diplomacy may not be going as smoothly as we had hoped; once more, as with health care, the conjugal psychodrama drags down the positive contribution the couple can make on policy", wrote Maureen Dowd in Wednesday's New York Times. More troubling for the Clintons is the fact that her angry outburst has rekindled speculation about their state of marriage. Even nearly 10 years after leaving office, late night comedians, especially Jay Leno, still misses no opportunity to remind viewers about President Clinton's apparent weakness for pretty young women. At home, State Department officials are frantically trying to limit the damage caused by the Congo episode and urging reporters to highlight the core messages she has delivered during her trip on human rights, democracy and empowerment of women across the continent. The controversy may eventually die down but analysts say the episode will have a lingering shadow on her future role as the secretary of state. They also caution that she has to be extremely careful in her tone and action in the future and any misstep in future would prompt the cable TV networks to use the tape over and over again. And be assured Hillary Clinton is just not the secretary of state; she's a celebrity in her own right. And for sure, there'll be no dearth of interest on the part of the media to follow the celebrity wherever she g
