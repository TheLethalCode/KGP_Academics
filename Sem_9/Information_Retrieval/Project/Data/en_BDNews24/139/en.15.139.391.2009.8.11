 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to cut gas supplies to factories during peak hours over Ramadan in a bid to maintain uninterrupted power supplies for Iftar, Sehri and Tarabih Salah prayer times. "It should be possible to produce 200-300 additional megawatts of electricity per day by reducing the supply of gas by 50 million cubic square feet a day to factories during Ramadan," Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the prime minister's energy adviser, told reporters on Tuesday after an inter-ministerial meeting. According to an energy ministry statement, the daily target for electricity production over Ramadan is around 4,200 megawatts. Increased gas supplies will be diverted to power plants during peak hours to boost electricity production, said the statement. The meeting also discussed the scopes for introducing staggered weekly holidays in industrial zones to ensure smoother gas supplies. It also decided to make sure that shopping malls were closing sharp at 8pm according to law. State minister Mohammmad Enamul Haque requested the meeting to create awareness among people regarding energy saving behaviour and minimising light-decorations during Ramadan. bd
