Jardine Lloyd had been expected to post profit of around 79.1 million pounds according to the average of eight analyst forecasts given to Reuters Estimates, within a range of 75.0 to 83.6 million.

Jardine Lloyd proposed a final dividend of 12 pence, making a total payout for the year of 20.5p, unchanged from 2006. Shares in Jardine Lloyd, which have underperformed the UK non-life insurers' sector by around 5 percent in the past 12 months, closed at 360p on Monday, valuing the company at around 772.5 million poun
