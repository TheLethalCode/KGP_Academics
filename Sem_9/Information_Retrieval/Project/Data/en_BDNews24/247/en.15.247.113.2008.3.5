 Ruchira Singh Mumbai, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's silver demand is expected to remain slack this month, with prices seen firm and targeting new highs as more funds in Western markets move to precious metals boosting prices, analysts and traders said. Silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd struck a new high of 26,271 rupees per kg on Tuesday, and analysts said it had the appetite for more highs, albeit with some likely corrections. "The trend is quite biased for further gains, but this does not reduce the chances of heavy slides as many indicators are hovering near the overbought zones," said Pradeep Unni, assistant vice president at Vision Commodities Services DMCC. Vamsi Krishna Kona, senior analyst, Karvy Comtrade Ltd, said the May silver on MCX could rise to 29,500 rupees at the end of this month or at the beginning of April. "We are expecting some corrections before the market rallies again," Kona said. "This is because in the last two month or so, prices have risen steadily without any correction." Kona said the dip could take May silver to 24,400 rupees. TRADERS UNHAPPY Traders in the physical market said they expect sales to be as dull as it has been in the last few months unless prices fall substantially. "There are no customers even though prices are at a discount to international rates," said Haresh Kewalramani, who has a prominent silver articles shop, Vishindas Gianchand, in Zaveri Bazaar. A large trader in Kolkata, Harshad Ajmera of JJ Gold House, said the white metal was seeing only negligible sales despite a hefty discount of over 3,000 rupees per kg over what the banks quoted. "In gold at least some business is being done, in silver there is barely any," Ajmera said. Ajmera said prospects of silver sales would remain dim unless prices fall to around 20,000 rupees. The president of the Bombay Bullion Association, Suresh Hundia, who is also a large national silver trader, said much like the gold market, the silver market was seeing a lot of scrap sales by people eager to encash the record highs. This had kept demand for imported silver subdued, Hundia said. "There has hardly been any imports since November last year... banks are sitting on silver stocks that they have to send back," Hundia added. Silver futures on MCX have risen by 20 percent over the last month.
