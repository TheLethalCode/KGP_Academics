<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Villarreal missed their chance to tighten their grip on a Champions League berth on Sunday when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by struggling Osasuna. Manuel Pelligrini's side lacked their usual fluency and bite in attack and were unable to break down a dogged Osasuna defence in a dour affair at the Madrigal. Despite the draw Villarreal remain in third spot in the table, but are now just three points clear of Atletico Madrid who thumped second-placed Barcelona 4-2 at the Calderon on Saturday. Real Madrid cashed in on Barcelona's slip-up with a 3-2 win at Recreativo Huelva on Saturday that allowed them to restore their five-point advantage over the Catalans at the top of the table. Real lead the standings on 59 points, Barca follow on 54, seven clear of Villarreal and 10 ahead of Atletico. Surprise package Racing Santander moved up to sixth place thanks to a 1-0 victory at Valladolid on Sunday, Argentine midfielder Aldo Duscher striking a late winner when he ballooned a shot into the far corner four minutes from time. The match of the day, though, was at the Coliseum in Madrid where 10-man Real Mallorca scored two quick-fire goals late in the second half to spoil Getafe's impressive run of recent form and earn themselves a point in an entertaining 3-3 draw. OWN GOAL Getafe looked to be on course for an easy win after strikes from Mario Cotelo and Juan Albin and an own goal from Ivan Ramis put them 3-1 up against the islanders, who were reduced to 10 men when Lionel Scaloni was sent off late in the first half. But Mallorca were thrown a lifeline 13 minutes from time when striker Juan Arango let fly with a superbly struck free kick from 25 metres out. Minutes later the Venezuelan international provided the assist for defender Ramis to skim a header into the net after another great free kick. Despite the draw Michael Laudrup's Getafe, who are in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup and on the verge of a securing a place in the final of the King's Cup for the second season in succession, remain in 10th place in the table. They are a point clear of an improving Real Betis who crushed relegation-threatened Real Murcia 4-0 in Seville. Real Zaragoza were dragged into the danger zone after they slumped to their fourth defeat in a row when they went down 2-1 away to basement side Levante and are now languishing in 17th place in the standings. Levante remain anchored to the foot of the table with 19 points, four adrift of Murcia and 10 behind Recreativo, but there are seven other sides within three points of the relegation zone
