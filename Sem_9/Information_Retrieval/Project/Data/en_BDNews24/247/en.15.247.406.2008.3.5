 CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa coach Mickey Arthur says he would prefer to give young players exposure than regain top spot in the rankings by sweeping the upcoming one-day series against Bangladesh. "It is nice to be tied number one and even nicer to be the top ranked side," Arthur told reporters on Wednesday. "We all take a lot pride in that, but having said that (the ranking) is not the be all and end all." He added: "We should not just look at that. We have to give our youngsters an opportunity with the tour of England, Champions Trophy and the tour of Australia coming up this year." The three-match one-day-international series begins in Chittagong on Sunday. The remaining two matches will be played in Dhaka on March 12 and 14. South Africa now jointly lead the one-day ranking after world champions Australia lost to India in Brisbane on Tuesday. South Africa can take top spot if they sweep the Bangladesh series. Australia dropped three points with their loss in the tri-series to tie with South Africa on 127 points. However, if Bangladesh win one game, South Africa will drop to 125 ratings points and will fall below Australia
