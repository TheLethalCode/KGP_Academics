 KHOST, Afghanistan, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber killed an Afghan policeman and wounded four others in an attack on a government building in the southeastern province of Khost on Tuesday, the district governor said. The attack in the Tani district of Khost, close to the Pakistan border, came a day after Taliban insurgents opened fire on guards on a joint NATO and Afghan military compound in another part of the same province then rammed a truck bomb into the base. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said on Tuesday two of its soldiers were killed and 15 people were wounded in Monday's attack in the district of Sabri. The vast majority of ISAF troops in Khost are American. The Taliban carried out more suicide and roadside bomb attacks in Afghanistan last year after suffering heavy casualties whenever they engage Afghan and foreign troops in direct combat. As snows melt across the mountainous country, both sides in the conflict are gearing up for the traditional Spring start of the fighting seas
