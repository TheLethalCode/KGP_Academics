<TITLE> Japan PM seeks talks with opposition on BOJ chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister called on Monday for talks with the opposition to try to break a deepening deadlock that is fanning doubts over whether the government can win approval for its top pick for the next central bank chief. The political bickering has heightened fears of a monetary policy vacuum and could damage the Bank of Japan's image if the fracas drags on, financial market experts said. "It is time to hold talks so the matter can be decided as soon as possible," Kyodo news agency quoted Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda as telling reporters, adding that a vacancy in the Bank of Japan's top post would "affect confidence in Japan". Fukuda later stressed in a separate comment to reporters that the government could not allow any policy vacuum. The deadlock in parliament is the latest headache to plague Fukuda, whose popularity has been sliding on doubts about his leadership since he took office in September. Angered by the ruling bloc's move to ram the government's annual budget and tax measures through the lower house on Friday, opposition parties have signalled they would reject Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto -- authorities' unofficial favourite -- if the government proposes him to succeed Governor Toshihiko Fukui, who retires in two weeks. Former BOJ deputy governor Yutaka Yamaguchi, seen as slightly more hawkish on interest rates and lacking Muto's skills at political manoeuvring, has been floated as an alternative. "The on-again, off-again saga of Muto's nomination as next BOJ governor is descending into farce," wrote Glenn Maguire, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, in a commentary on Monday. On Monday, the opposition bloc turned down a ruling camp proposal to start budget deliberations in the upper house as soon as possible, Kyodo news agency reported, raising the spectre of a prolonged halt to parliamentary business. The Democrats and smaller allies won control of the upper house last year and can not only delay laws, but block senior appointments such as those of a successor to Fukui. "If they can't decide the BOJ governor there'll be a vacuum in terms of monetary policy," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. "Most of all, though, this shows that the BOJ is now becoming caught up in the political process in Japan, when it really should be separate," he said. "This really is not world standard and is a bit embarrassing." POLITICAL CAPITAL Japanese media said the government and ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) executives had agreed to put forward a candidate by the end of the week. Japanese stocks fell more than 4 percent on Monday, with Honda Motor Corp and other exporters battered by a strong yen, which hit a three-year high against the dollar. On Sunday, a senior official from the main opposition Democratic Party was quoted as saying a "cooling-off period" was needed in procedures to choose the next central bank governor. Some Democrats have misgivings about Muto, the favourite of the government and financial markets, because he is a former senior finance ministry official, raising questions about how independent monetary policy would be. While the government has a system in place to ensure it has an acting governor if there is a vacancy, analysts say they doubt that a temporary chief would be able to make long-term policy decisions. A Mainichi newspaper poll showed on Monday that 51 percent of respondents did not back Fukuda's cabinet compared with 30 percent who did. Support levels of more than 30 percent are widely seen by analysts in Japan as critical to staying in power. The newspaper attributed the latest decline to Fukuda's handling of an inquiry into a collision between a naval destroyer and a fishing boat last month, an incident that has led to calls from opposition parties for his defence minister to resign. The Mainichi poll showed 49 percent of respondents wanted Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba to quit amid accusations of a cover-up over the events leading to the collision. Ishiba has denied trying to hide information, and Fukuda has said the minister should stay on. On Monday, another Japanese destroyer collided with a Russian-owned freighter flying a Cambodian flag in the Vietnamese port of Ho Chi Minh City, although no one was injured and damage to the vessels was slight, a defence ministry spokesman sa
