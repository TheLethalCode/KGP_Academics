<TITLE> Admiral beats forecasts, UK recovery seen slow </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Motor insurer Admiral reported a 24 percent jump in 2007 profit, beating forecasts, but said UK trading conditions were improving very slowly and warned of a tougher year ahead for its price comparison site. British motor insurers have long seen premiums kept under pressure by tough competition, despite the rising cost of claims. Recently, major players have indicated the tide is turning, but Admiral warned on Tuesday that change was slow. "It looks like the market has found the corner and is, well, considering turning. But it hasn't quite turned yet," Chief Executive Henry Engelhardt said. He said improved premiums would not hit market results until 2008, while a strong turn may not come until 2009. Admiral, whose brands include Elephant and comparison site Confused, said it put UK rates up 4 percent in 2007 against a 3 percent claims rise, below a longterm claims trend of 5 percent. "Because of the growth of price comparison sites we are probably not looking at some sort of knee jerk reaction," he told Reuters in an interview. "We are probably looking at everything being much more gradual, inching forward." The cautious comments weighed on Admiral's shares, which were down 4.6 percent at 956p at 0830 GMT, underperforming peers. Analysts at Merrill Lynch said the outlook was "slightly disappointing and surprising given more positive comments from competitors with some suggesting a 6-8 percent (rate) rise". Admiral's shares have climbed almost 13 percent since the end of June 2007, far outpacing the wider sector as it benefits from earnings that are seen as uncorrelated to wider economic woes, a more positive view on the motor insurance market and its admission to the FTSE index in the autumn. PROFIT CLIMBS Pretax profit for the full year came in at 182.1 million pounds ($361.5 million), comprehensively beating an average forecast of 172.4 million pounds, according to analysts polled by the firm, thanks to higher underwriting profitability and profit from complementary products like car breakdown cover. Admiral's combined ratio -- costs and claims as a percentage of premiums and a key profitability measure -- improved by two percentage points to 85 percent, making it one of the industry's strongest. A number below 100 indicates a profit. Together with the increase in premiums, this resulted in a 32 percent rise in underwriting profits, to 37.5 million pounds. Net revenue rose 17 percent to 364.1 million pounds and Admiral said revenue from products and services it does not underwrite -- the complementary products like car hire insurance -- rose 34 percent to 176.9 million pounds. Engelhardt said income from these products per policyholder in 2008 would be at least as high as in 2007. Confused.com reported an almost 60 percent increase in profit to 36.7 million pounds and gave 13 million quotes, despite intensifying competition as Tesco and other newcomers crowd the sector. But Admiral warned higher marketing spend could hit margins. Admiral's Spanish venture, launched in October 2006, ended 2007 with 47,000 customers and a 700,000 pound loss while Germany, which launched last year, had 9,000 customers on Jan 1. Engelhardt said the group was on track to move into Italy this year, with further launches being considered for France and the United States for as early as 2009 and 2010. Admiral said it would pay a total 2007 dividend of 43.
