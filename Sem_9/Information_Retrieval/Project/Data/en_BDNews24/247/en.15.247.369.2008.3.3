 LONDON, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares slid 1.6 percent early on Monday, tracking falls in global equity markets as banks and commodity stocks slumped over worries about financial sector writedowns and a looming US recession. But Europe's biggest bank, HSBC rose as much as 1.9 percent after posting a rise in group pretax profit as strong gains in Asia helped it absorb a $17.2 billion hit for bad debts due to US housing market problems. It pared gains later but was still up 0.3 percent. At 0906 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.55 percent at 1,294.92 points. UBS was among the top weighted losers, sliding 5 percent to add to recent weakness after Credit Suisse analysts estimated UBS would have to make potential further writedowns of 15.5 billion Swiss francs ($14.85 billion). Commerzbank fell 3 percent while Alliance & Leicester and Royal Bank of Scotland shed more than 4 percent. Oil stocks Total, Royal Dutch Shell and BP all fell more than 1 percent, tracking a fall in the price in crude. But Swedish truckmaker Scania jumped 4 percent after Germany's Volkswagen said it would raise its stake in Scania to 68.6 percent, a move that may lead to a merger of Scania and German truckmaker MAN. Volkswagen was flat and MAN up 4.6 percent. And EADS rose 7 percent after it won part of a $35 billion U.S. Air Force refuelling deal late on Friday in a surprise blow to Boeing. Strategists said uncertainties continued to cloud the outlook for European equities, which have lost favour with fund managers over the past year. "The medium term is very difficult to predict as there are a lot of unanswered questions around banks' balance sheets," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Swiss bank Pictet. "Estimates show a lot of shareholder equity is having to be written down, which will make banks shy to lend this year, and we will also have more dilution from capital increases." "And the fact that the banks can't bring pending IPOs to market means that they're using part of their capital for operations that brings no revenue for the time being," he said. BATTERED BANKS Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were down by 1.5 to 1.7 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost more than 14 percent so far this year, taken lower by fears over the banking sector stemming from a credit-market crisis that has seen many lenders make huge writedowns. Two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have helped cushion the fall, and Fed fund futures now show a 74 percent chance of a cut in rates by a further 75 basis points at the next meeting on March 18. But the DJ Stoxx European banking index has lost 19 percent so far this year, compared to a 17 percent fall in the whole of last year. UBS shares are down 38 percent this year after a fall of nearly 30 percent last year, while HSBC has fared much better, down 8.8 percent year to date after losing nearly 10 percent in 2007. Traders said HSBC's results were relatively less worrisome, as well. "(It's) a bit of a relief," one London trader said. "All in all, in-line numbers, slightly better in Asia and talk of Asia decoupling, which is enough to push the shares u
