 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com) The verdict scheduled for Tuesday in a corruption case against former Awami League lawmaker HBM Iqbal has been reset for March 11. The date was deferred as judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 sited on the Sangsad Bhaban premises was on leave. The other persons accused in the case are Iqbal's wife Momtaz Begum Doly, two sons Moyeen Iqbal and Imran Iqbal and daughter Nowrin Iqbal, all charged of assisting him in amassing wealth. All of the accused are currently on the run. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Md Ibrahim filed the case on June 25 last year with Gulshan Police Station. According to case details, Iqbal concealed wealth worth Tk 10.61 crore in the wealth statement he submitted to the ACC and acquired wealth worth Tk 2.30 crore beyond his known sources of income. The case also states that Iqbal's sons acquired wealth worth Tk 6.75 lakh, while his daughter amassed Tk 1.53 crore illegally. On Feb 18 last year, the ACC made a list of 50 graft suspects, which included politicians and government officials. They were asked to turn in accounts of their moveable and immoveable assets within 72 hours from notification to the ACC. Iqbal was on the list. bdnews24.co
