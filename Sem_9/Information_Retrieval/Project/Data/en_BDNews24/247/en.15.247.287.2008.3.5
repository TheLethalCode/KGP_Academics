 JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African power firm Eskom may delay approval for connecting new construction projects to its grid for up to six months in a bid to alleviate a power crisis, it said on Wednesday. The crisis forced a shutdown of crucial mines for five days in January and since then mines have been operating with only 90 percent of their usual power, raising fears of massive job losses and helping keep global prices for precious metals high. The electricity shortages, the result of nearly a decade of under-spending on generating capacity, have also brought concerns that economic growth could stumble ahead of the 2010 Soccer World Cup, which South Africa is hosting. Eskom said approval for new power connections to construction projects requiring more than 100 kilo volt-ampere (kVA) (80 KW) may take four to six months. A spokeswoman said a building project requiring electricity to power two water heaters, lighting and underfloor heating would need about 100 kVA -- which could include almost anything except residential developments or the smallest businesses. "New applications that require more than 100 kVA's, will have to be processed, and that process will take four to six months and its a rolling four to six months before they give you a quotation," an Eskom spokeswoman said. "Someone who's building something small, which requires less than 100 kva's, those are not a problem, that goes on," she added. The government said separately that Eskom has opened bids for industrial users like fuels group Sasol to generate electricity from waste heat produced in their manufacturing processes. That could generate an additional 3,500 megawatts, Ompi Aphane, chief director of electricity at the Department of Minerals and Energy, told a parliamentary briefing in Cape Town. To stabilise the system, South Africa needs an additional 4,000 megawatts now, but will need much more in future to be able to maintain economic growth. State-owned Eskom plans to spend 343 billion rand ($43.74 billion) increasing its generating capacity over the next five years and has invited bids for a new nuclear power station. Afrikaans daily Beeld reported that as part of new measures aimed at alleviating the power crunch, households in the country's Gauteng province industrial heartland around Johannesburg, will also face power rationing every second day. Gold Fields, the world's fourth-largest gold miner, has warned it could cut 6,900 jobs and the government said it will give details of a mining and job losses review on Friday. Powerful unions have threatened protests if there are job cu
