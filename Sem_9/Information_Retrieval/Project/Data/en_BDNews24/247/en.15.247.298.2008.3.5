 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)  Late film actor Manna's wife Sheli Quader has blamed a city hospital for her husband's death. "Manna died prematurely because of the negligence of United Hospital," Sheli told a news briefing Wednesday at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. The hospital authorities, however, rejected the allegation. Sheli said their only son lost his father, the country's film industry lost a bright star, and the hospital authority would have to shoulder the responsibility. She said there was no specialist doctor in the hospital to treat Manna after he was rushed there with chest pains on Feb 17. The late actor's wife said she wrote a letter to the chief adviser with an appeal to punish those responsible. "If the people responsible are punished it will be a landmark," she said. Sheli said a previous statement of the hospital authorities, that it did not receive an immediate decision from Manna's family for his treatment, was false. "In fact, the hospital lacked the sense of responsibility and morality to save a vulnerable patient at that time," she said. "They are now trying to suppress their failure." Shejuti Zaman, an official of United Hospital, said Sheli's allegations were baseless. She said cardiology specialist Zahiruddin M Ilias was present when Manna was rushed to the hospital. "We protest the statement and we will formally make our position clear later today," Shejuti said told bdnews24.com when asked by phone to comment on Sheli Quader's allegations. Manna's son Siam Imtemas, brother Prince Talukder Panna and other family members also attended the press conference. bdne
