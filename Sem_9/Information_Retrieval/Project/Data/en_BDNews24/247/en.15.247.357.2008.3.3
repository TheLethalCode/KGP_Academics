<TITLE> Leaders on divided Cyprus may meet in March: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nicosia, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities on divided Cyprus are expected to meet this month to discuss reviving reunification talks, the UN envoy to the island said on Monday. "I will start preparations for that meeting, probably towards the end of the second half of this month," U.N. resident representative Michael Moller told reporters after meeting Greek-Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. It will be the first meeting between Turkish-Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and the Greek-Cypriot leader since Christofias won presidential elections on Feb. 24, pledging to push for a settlement which has defied mediation for decades. "I had a very good meeting with President Christofias and (he) told me he is very keen and ready to meet with Mr Talat as soon as possible, and he has asked me to continue working on that," Moller said. Christofias was elected on a tide of public discontent with the policies of his predecessor, Tassos Papadopoulos, who led Greek Cypriots in rejecting a U.N. reunification plan in 2004. Papadopoulos had last met Talat in September 2007. Cyprus was divided in a 1974 Turkish invasion which followed a brief Greek-inspired coup. The United Nations, deployed during Greek-Turkish inter-communal violence a decade earlier, patrols a ceasefire line slicing through the island east to west. Moller said he was discussing how to open up a main thoroughfare in the capital Nicosia which has been an enduring symbol of the medieval city's division for at least four decades, and could be a confidence building measure between the two sides. "We are continuing our preparatory work and hopefully we can give you some good news soon," Moller said. Ledra Street was blocked off in fighting. The road is the hub of commercial activity on both Turkish and Greek ends of the town, but is now cut off at its centre and forms part of a UN buffer zone where nobody is allowed access. Cyprus entered the European Union in May 2004 as a divided island. Its partition is hampering Turkey's ambitions to join the EU, which recognises the Greek-Cypriot government in the south. An incremental approach to confidence building -- outlined in a July 2006 deal brokered by the U.N. -- has not been implemented because of disputes over the agenda.
