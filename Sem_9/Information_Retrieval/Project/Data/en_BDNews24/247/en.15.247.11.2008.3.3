 BUENOS AIRES, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Martin Palermo scored a record-equalling goal for Boca Juniors to give them a 1-0 win at Gimnasia-La Plata and take them top of the Argentine Clausura championship on Sunday. Palermo, 34, converted a controversial penalty in the 42nd minute to equal the club record of 180 goals set by Francisco Varallo in the 1930s. The burly former Villarreal striker, who once missed three penalties in a game for Argentina against Colombia and is a cult figure with Boca supporters, has scored four goals in as many games in the Clausura. The hosts pressed for an equaliser in the second half but lost momentum after forward Sergio Leal was sent off for elbowing in the 74th minute. Boca, who have 10 points, went top on goal difference from Velez Sarsfield, who were held to a goalless draw by Gimnasia-Jujuy on Saturday. River Plate's attempt to notch a third win in eight days was frustrated when torrential rain forced their game against San Martin to be suspended. Referee Gabriel Brazenas stopped play with River leading 3-2 after the pitch became unplayable. It was not immediately clear when the remainder of the match would be played, although San Martin, who face a 1,100 kilometre journey home, have asked to finish on Monday to save them making another trip to Buenos Aires. Diego Buonanotte, a 19-year-old regarded as one of Argentina's most promising players, was among the scorers for River. Uruguayan international Sebastian Abreu and Cristian Nasuti were also on target for Diego Simeone's team while Sebastian Brusco and Martin Bravo replied for San Martin. Champions Lanus went down to a 3-2 defeat at Olimpo, despite twice leading through goals by Diego Gonzalez. Jose Ulloa and Gustavo Pinto hauled Olimpo back before Ulloa's second goal in the 72nd minute gave the hosts the points
