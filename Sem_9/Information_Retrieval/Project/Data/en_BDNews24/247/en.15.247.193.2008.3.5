<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday ruled that the detention of former BNP health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain was illegal in a case involving charges of breaking emergency rules. The court asked authorities to set him free if there were no other charges against him. A two-member panel of justice Mirza Hossain Haider and justice Mamnun Rahman made the order upon a writ petition by Mosharraf's son Khandaker Maruf Hossain. Mosharraf's freedom, however, is yet to be granted since he further faces two separate charges of corruption, said his lawyer barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon. A team of joint forces arrested Mosharraf on March 7 at his Gulshan home, and he was placed in detention under the special powers act four days later. The authorities brought charges of breaking emergency rules, and thus posing a threat to public security, according to details of the the detention order. Barrister Khokon told the court that the charges against Mosharraf were baseless and the detention was a means of political harassment of his client. Deputy attorney general Mubina Asaf represented the state in the proceedings. bdne
