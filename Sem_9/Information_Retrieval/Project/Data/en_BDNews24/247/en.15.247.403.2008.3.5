<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka University student and activist of Bangladesh Chhatra League filed a case Wednesday against former state minister Lutfuzzaman Babar and five police officials for falsely implicating him in a case during the BNP's last term in office. Md Abbas Bhuiyan filed the case with the chief metropolitan magistrate's court, saying that he was falsely implicated in the case involving an attempted attack on late Dhaka University teacher Dr Humayun Azad in 2004. Police later arrested him from a rally in protest at the teacher's attack, and allegedly tortured him at Ramna Police Station. The plaintiff claimed that the police officials forcibly tried to extract a statement that he was involved in the attack on Dr Azad. After it was proved that he was innocent, Bhuyian was freed. The accused police officials are Ramna police chief Mahbubur Rahman, sub-inspector Rezaul Karim, sub-inspector Naser Ali and Nilkhet police outpost sergeant Anwar Hossain. Metropolitan magistrate Emran Hossain Chowdhury is expected to deliver an ruling in the case later Wednesday. On why he took such a long time to file the case, after the alleged incidents, Abbas told bdnews24.com:"I did not file the case during the four-party coalition government as I didn't believe I would get justice." The Bangladesh Institute of Human Rights is providing legal assistance to Abbas to fight the case. bdnews2
