 BEIJING, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new round of sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN Security Council for refusing to suspend nuclear enrichment will not affect China's trade with that country, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. The sanctions resolution calls for more travel and financial curbs on Iranian individuals and companies and makes some restrictions mandatory.
