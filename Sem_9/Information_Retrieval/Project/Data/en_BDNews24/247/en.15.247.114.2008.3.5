 London, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rose by midday on Wednesday, snapping a five-day losing run, as gains in potential bid targets Prudential and Liberty International offset the drag of companies going ex-dividend. By 1136 GMT, the UK blue-chip index was up 43.7 points, or 0.8 percent at 5,811.4, underperforming major European indexes. The FTSE 100 had fallen by about 5 percent over the previous five trading days and is down 10 percent for the year on fears of a US recession and further credit-related writedowns by financial institutions. "We had a 300-point fall in five trading sessions. You are probably looking for bargain hunting at some point when there is no material change in the economic or corporate backdrop, which there isn't," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "Perhaps this is an early sign of that." Increased hopes of a deal to rescue ailing bond insurer Ambac Financial Group pushed the company's shares up and helped the broader U.S. stock market cut losses on Tuesday. Also bolstering the insurance sector, Prudential climbed 5.6 percent after shareholders in China's Ping An Insurance approved a plan to raise about $17 billion, prompting fresh speculation it could take a stake in a European insurer. Aviva put on 2.9 percent, Old Mutual added 1.9 percent and Legal & General advanced 2.8 percent. Liberty International jumped 5.7 percent after the Independent newspaper said the property firm was in talks with a major rival to form the world's largest shopping mall group. The newspaper said Australia's Westfield Group and Singapore's GIC Real Estate had been mooted as potential suitors. Liberty International declined to comment. Peers Hammerson, British Land, and Land Securities also rose. EX-DIVIDEND WEIGHS Banks were mixed, with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB all down after going ex-dividend. HBOS, however, was up 4.5 percent after ABN AMRO upgraded Britain's biggest mortgage lender to "hold" from "sell". Within the sector, Alliance & Leicester gained 4 percent and HSBC rose 2.6 percent. Investors will get further evidence of the strength of the US economy at 1500 GMT with January factory orders and February non-manufacturing data. Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier advanced 1.6 percent. The Times said private equity group Permira had emerged as a potential suitor for Reed Business Information, its trade magazines arm which could soon be for sale for about 1.25 billion pounds. Hedge fund group Man Group added 5.1 percent after it said the net asset value of its main AHL Diversified Futures fund rose 5.9 percent last week. British broadcaster ITV gained 2.1 percent after it said net advertising revenues for its family of channels was expected to be up almost 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008, It also reported 2007 results broadly in line with expectations.
