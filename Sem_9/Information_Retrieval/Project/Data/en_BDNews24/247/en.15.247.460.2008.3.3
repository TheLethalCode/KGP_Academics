<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)A Saudi company Monday expressed interests to establish technical training institutes in Bangladesh to produce skilled workers prior to employing them. A delegation from Saudi conglomerate Dallah Albaraka met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office, with an offer that they would bear the cost of the initiative. "Bangladeshis sell out all their wealth to go to Saudi Arabia. We want to appoint Bangladeshis to our company at our own expense," assistant director (recruitment) for the company, Jaber Abubaker Khalifa, told reporters after the meeting. He said his company wanted to set up the technical training institutes in Bangladesh to produce skilled workers for his company, which had so far appointed about one lakh Bangladeshis to positions in Saudi Arabia. "The company said it required skilled manpower to meet its growing need for technical human resources," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com. The Dallah Albaraka delegation came to Dhaka in a bid to meet the company's requirement for 120 engineers, a foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com. The foreign affairs adviser said despite "stray incidences of law breaking" by a few Bangladeshis, the Saudi demand for Bangladeshi workers was on the rise. The adviser said he was unaware of the Saudi government's decision not to issue visas to Bangladeshis. "Twenty thousand Bangladeshis went to Saudi Arabia in February alone," he said. There are more than 17.5 lakh Bangladeshis currently working in Saudi Arabia, the largest overseas labour market for the country. Reports of Bangladeshi workers breaking the law in Saudi Arabia prompted the kingdom to take legal action against those involved. The foreign affairs ministry in February asked the Bangladesh mission in Riyadh to submit a report on the state of the Bangladesh labour force in Saudi Arabia. The adviser earlier told reporters that he wished to visit the kingdom to solve outstanding labour issues. bdn
