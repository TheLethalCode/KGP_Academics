 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)The deputy inspector general of prisons, Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, said Tuesday that there had been no lapse in former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's medical treatment during the seven and a half months of her detention. The prisons official told reporters at Dhaka Central Jail that recent media reports saying that Hasina's treatment was being hindered or hampered were not true. Siddiqui said six physicians of Hasina's choice would examine her Wednesday and the decision on her next course of treatment would be taken based on their results. Asked whether the government would form a medical board for Hasina, the DIG said: "After the six doctors give their opinion, if necessary the government will take that decision at a higher level." "There was no lapse in Sheikh Hasina's treatment during her seven and a half months' detention. No medicine has ever been stopped. Doctors saw her in time." "The news reported by different media saying that her medicine was stopped for three days, that she is not being allowed to see doctors, or that her relatives are not being allowed to meet her, is not true," Siddiqui said. "These are baseless reports." He said Hasina has so far met her relatives on 15 separate occasions, and met with her lawyers 26 times. Doctors visited her whenever it was necessary, he added. Prison-appointed doctor Suraiya Bulbul, who regularly examines Hasina, had earlier told reporters: "The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating for the last two to three months." "It is now under control after the dosage of her medicine was changed as per the advice of her personal physician." The six doctors of Hasina's choice, who will examine her Wednesday, are Syed Modasser Ali, ABM Abadullah, Pran Gopal Dutta, MH Millat, Baren Chakravarty and Shahla Khatun, Siddiqui said. bdnews24.
