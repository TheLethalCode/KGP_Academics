 BAGHDAD, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday hailed Iran and Iraq as world leaders in "justice and morality", a day after accusing the United States of spreading terrorism in the region. Ahmadinejad held meetings on Monday with Shia clerics and academics and actors at Iraqi President Jalal Talabani's house in Baghdad on the second day of his trip to Iraq. He is the first Iranian leader to visit since the two neighbours fought an eight-year war in the 1980s that killed 1 million people. Ahmadinejad took a swipe at Iran's foe, the United States, which has more than 150,000 troops in Iraq, criticising US President George W Bush for saying Iran was arming Shia militias in Iraq, a charge Iran has long denied. "Six years ago there were none of these terrorists. When the others stepped foot in this country and region we find a foothold for the terrorists," he told reporters late on Sunday, referring to the US-led invasion of Iraqi in 2003. But Ahmadinejad, known for his provocative rhetoric, has largely been restrained during the visit, offering only mild criticism of the United States, possibly to avoid embarrassing his Iraqi hosts. "Nations are dissatisfied with the rules that now dominate the world. They want justice. The nations of Iran and Iraq are front-runners in establishing justice, morality, kindness," he said in comments carried by Iranian state television on Monday. Official and pro-government media in Iran have given Ahmadinejad's visit extensive coverage. The official daily, Iran, carried the banner headline "Baghdad's historic day" and its commentary highlighted the fact that Arab leaders have not yet made such a trip to Iraq. Analysts say the president will welcome any diplomatic distraction from criticism by opponents at home about his economic policies, blamed for stoking inflation, before a March parliamentary election that will test his popularity. DEALS TO BE SIGNED Reflecting the political infighting, some newspapers aligned to opponents gave his visit only brief mention. Pro-reform daily Etemad-e Melli gave its front page mainly to the appointment of a new national soccer coach with a small reference to the trip. But several other newspapers saw the visit as a diplomatic triumph for the president and Iran, which the United States is seeking to isolate over its nuclear programme. Iraqis themselves had mixed feelings about the Iranian president's visit. Many Sunni Arabs, who were dominant under Saddam Hussein, resent the Shi'ite rise to power in Iraq and believe Iran controls Iraqi Shi'ite leaders and is arming Shi'ite militants to attack them. In mainly Sunni Arab Falluja west of Baghdad, protesters marched through the city on Sunday waving banners saying "Get your non-Arab hands off Iraq". Both Iran and Iraq are run by Shi'ite majorities, but while Iraq is largely Arab, Iran is mainly Persian. But in the holy city of Najaf, historically the centre of Shi'ite learning, Ahmadinejad's trip was welcomed. "Ahmadinejad's visit to Iraq is great and benefits the nation of Iraq as it strengthens the relations between the two countries," said cloth merchant Mohammed Nasy, 27. Iraqi officials said up to 10 bilateral accords would be signed during Ahmadinejad's trip. "Agreements will be signed today on behalf of the ministries of transport, including railways and freight and sea transport," said Shirwan al Waeli, Iraq's minister of national securi
