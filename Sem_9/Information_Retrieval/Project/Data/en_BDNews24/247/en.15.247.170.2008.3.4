 Abuja, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen kidnapped a German construction worker and killed a soldier on Tuesday in the oil producing Niger Delta in southern Nigeria, security experts working for foreign companies said. Abductions for ransom are common in the delta and most hostages are released unharmed. Over 200 foreigners have been seized in an upsurge of violence since early 2006 although there had been a lull since October last year. Violence in the Niger Delta, home to Africa's biggest oil industry which produces 2.1 million barrels per day, has been one of the causes of record high oil prices in world markets. The German man seized on Tuesday works for German-Nigerian construction group Julius Berger, an arm of Bilfinger Berger AG, said a company source who declined to be named. "One expat (foreign resident) was abducted by armed criminals on the east-west road between Rumuji and Emuoha areas of Port Harcourt at about 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) today," said one of the security experts, who requested anonymity. "One escort soldier was killed and a driver was wounded. He is receiving attention," he said. An army spokesman confirmed a foreigner had been abducted but had no further details. The east-west road links Port Harcourt, the delta's main city located in Rivers state, to Warri, the capital of Delta state located further west. Julius Berger is upgrading the road and it has a construction site near Emuoha. The area is a short distance from Port Harcourt, which has been the epicentre of violence and kidnappings in the two-year crisis in the Niger Delta. Militants demanding greater local control of oil revenues for impoverished residents have blown up oil production facilities and kidnapped oil workers, forcing the closure of a fifth of output from the OPEC member. But violence has spiralled out of control, with copy-cat criminal gangs abducting both foreigners and Nigerians for money. Thousands of foreign workers have been evacuated from the region and those who remain live under tight security. Tuesday's abduction comes at a time when delta militants have been considering whether to persist with peace talks that were launched by President Umaru Yar'Adua, who came to power last May. The talks were one of the reasons for a lull in violence in the past few months, but militant leaders have expressed growing impatience with the slow pace of negotiations. Some have accused the government of insincerity. Sascha Bamberger, a spokesman for Bilfinger Berger in Mannheim, said the company was aware of reports of the possible kidnapping of one of its workers and was investigating. "We are in close contact with the authorities in Germany and Nigeria," he said, adding that workers from the firm had been targeted in the past but had all been released unharmed.
