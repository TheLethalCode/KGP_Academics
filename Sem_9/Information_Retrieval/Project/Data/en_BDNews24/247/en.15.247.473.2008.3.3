 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)The central bank Monday asked banks to follow more rigorous rules for opening beneficiary owner (BO) accounts. Applicants for BO accounts will now be required to submit bank certificates containing personal information, including names of parents and banking details of applicants. The Bangladesh Bank Monday issued the circular with the new requirements to the chief executives of all banks. According to the directive, the decision was taken after an appeal by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the capital market regulator, to help ensure proper development of the securities market. The mandatory bank certificates are also required to contain a signed photograph of the applicant. The signature is required to be the same as on other bank accounts. The circular provided guidelines to the banks to implement the decision effectively. bdnews
