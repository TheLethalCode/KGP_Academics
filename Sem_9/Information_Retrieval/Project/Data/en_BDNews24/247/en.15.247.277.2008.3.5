<TITLE> Local polls ahead of general election a political scheme: Menon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon Wednesday described the government's plan to hold the local government elections prior to the national polls as "a political scheme". Speaking at a press conference at the party's Topkhana Road office, Menon said the caretaker administration needed to clearly explain to the people why they were considering holding the local polls ahead of the "long overdue" parliamentary elections. "The caretaker government should assist in the process of holding a free and fair parliamentary election. Local government polls are not their responsibility," Menon said. "Holding any other polls before the national elections will be seen as introducing a new brand of democracy. I'm afraid such ploys are being considered," he said. Menon also criticised the nomination of non-political candidates to the mayoral elections. bdnew
