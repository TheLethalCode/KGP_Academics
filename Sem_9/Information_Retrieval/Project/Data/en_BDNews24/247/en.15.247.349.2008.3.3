<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)Bidisha, the estranged wife of former president HM Ershad, was granted bail Monday in a fraud case that involves the sale of a flat. Metropolitan magistrate Shaheen Uddin Ahmed granted Bidisha bail on a Tk 50,000 bond after she appeared in court. AKM Mosharraf Hossain Sikder, a Mirpur businessman, filed the case against Bidisha with Gulshan Police Station on Feb 7. The case states that on July 10 2001, Bidisha agreed to sell a flat of President's Park in Baridhara to Mosharraf, who paid her Tk 75,000 in advance. Bidisha, however, did not hand over the flat to Mosharraf, but, when asked to return the advance money, she gave him a First Security Bank cheque in 2005. The cheque bounced, which prompted Mosharraf to file the case. Mosharraf alleged that Bidisha had since been threatening him. He said he had not pressed charges against Bidisha earlier as "she was the wife of Ershad". Bidisha's lawyer M Sajawar Hossain said it was actually Ershad who had filed the case against Bidisha because of their dispute over their son Eric. Bidisha told bdnews24.com "Ershad has been harassing me for the past three years. He has filed this false case against me". bdnews24
