<TITLE> Afghan Foreign Minister condemns Prophet cartoon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Copenhagen, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's Foreign Minister on Monday deplored the reprinting of a caricature of the Prophet Mohammad in Danish newspapers last month, saying the publication was a misuse of freedom of expression. On Feb. 13 a number of Danish newspapers displayed the cartoon, one of 12 that prompted violent protests and riots in many Muslim countries in 2006, in solidarity with the artist after three men were arrested on suspicion of planning to kill him. Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, in Copenhagen for talks with Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller told a news conference he "condemned in all forms," the reprinting of the cartoon. "Freedom of speech should not be used to make a billion Muslims cry. Freedom of speech should make it possible to share information for enlightenment, peace and equality," he said. A number of Western newspapers also reprinted the cartoon last month, including the Wall Street Journal and Britain's Observer. The caricature shows the Prophet wearing a turban resembling a bomb. Afghanistan's Religious Affairs Ministry has called the reprinting of the cartoon as an attack against Islam. On Sunday, about 1,000 Afghans, mostly religious clerics in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, marched demanding withdrawal of Danish and Dutch troops from the country. A number of similar protest have been held in other Muslim countries in the last two weeks. Many Muslims consider any depiction of Mohammad insulting. In 2006 more than 50 people were killed during protests against the cartoons in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Moller said he had told Spanta that reprinting of the cartoon in more than 15 Danish newspapers last month was a direct result of the plan to murder the cartoonist and that it was up to the Danish courts to decide if publication had exceeded the limits of freedom of expression. Denmark has about 550 troops in Afghanistan.
