<TITLE> Japan deadlock threatens selection of new BOJ chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A political deadlock threatened the government's top pick for a new Japanese central bank chief, as a poll showed that doubts about beleaguered Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's leadership had further eroded his popularity. Angered by the ruling bloc's move to ram next year's budget and tax measures through the lower house on Friday, opposition parties have signalled they would reject Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto if the government proposes him to take over from Governor Toshihiko Fukui, who retires on March 19. Former BOJ Deputy Governor Yutaka Yamaguchi, seen as slightly more hawkish on interest rates and lacking Muto's skills at political manoeuvring, has been floated as an alternative. Fukuda's popularity has been sliding since he took office in September, and a Mainichi newspaper poll showed on Monday that 51 percent of respondents did not back his cabinet. Just 30 percent supported the prime minister, the poll showed. The newspaper attributed the decline to Fukuda's handling of the inquiry into a collision between a naval destroyer and a fishing boat last month, an incident that has led to calls from opposition parties for his defence chief to resign. The Mainichi poll showed 49 percent of respondents wanted Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba to quit amid accusations of a cover-up over the events leading to the collision. Ishiba has denied trying to hide information and Fukuda has said the minister should stay on. The defence chief's woes are adding to Fukuda's headaches in parliament, where opposition parties have been in control of the upper house since last year and can not only delay legislation, but block key appointments such as those of a successor to Fukui and his two deputies. The main opposition Democratic Party is threatening to boycott debate in the upper house after ruling parties forced the budget and a controversial tax measure through the lower house last week. On Sunday, a senior Democratic Party official was quoted by media as suggesting that a "cooling off period" was needed in procedures to choose the next central bank governor despite criticism that a delay would create a monetary policy vacuum. The Democratic Party has misgivings about Muto, the favourite of the government and financial markets, because he is a former senior finance ministry official and has close ties to the government, raising questions about how independent monetary policy would be. If parliament does not approve a candidate to replace Fukui before his term expires, his duties would be taken up by a deputy governor or an executive director, or Fukui himself could be appointed to the post of executive director temporarily
