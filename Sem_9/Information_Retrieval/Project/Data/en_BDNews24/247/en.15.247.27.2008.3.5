<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)  Obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Shahla Khatun visited Sheikh Hasina in jail Wednesday to check on reported health complaints of the detained leader, a top jail official said. Dr Shahla, one of Hasina's personal physician, examined the former prime minister between 10:55 am and 12:38 pm, said the inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Zakir Hasan. The doctor would not speak to reporters waiting outside the Sangsad Bhaban premises on her departure from the special jail. "She examined Sheikh Hasina in the morning and advised some tests, which are being organised now," the IG told bdnews24.com. He also said a cardiologist would see Hasina later in the day. The IG said Hasina's personal physicians would certainly be able to examine her but they would not get scope to visit her at the same time. "We want that the nominated doctors see Hasina separately, each taking sufficient time for their examination," Hasan said. The former prime minister has reportedly been suffering from various health complications, including glaucoma, high blood pressure and migraine. Her lawyers recently alleged that there had been a lapse in treatment of the Awami League chief, but a prisons official rejected the allegation on Tuesday. Hasina's husband MA Wazed Miah in a letter to the chief adviser sought permission to send Hasina to the United States for treatment. bdnews24
