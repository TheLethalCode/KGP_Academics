<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 04 (bdnews24.com)  Home affairs adviser MA Matin told reporters Tuesday that he has instructed the inspector general of prisons to look into the progress of Sheikh Hasina's health and medical treatment. Matin said the matter of Hasina's treatment abroad depends on the opinions of a medical board to be formed in this connection. Asked whether Khaleda Zia too might be sent abroad for treatment, Matin said any detained political leader will be sent abroad if the doctors say that it's a medical requirement. The adviser while talking to reporters at the shipping ministry said: "A high level medical board will be convened, if necessary, to review the issue of sending Sheikh Hasina abroad." "The government will take decision on it in accordance with the opinion of the board," Matin said. "I've asked the IG, prisons, today to send a doctor to the special jail to enquire into Sheikh Hasina's health status and medical treatment." The doctor will establish whether the former prime minister needs any specialist doctor's assistance and whether to provide necessary interventions, the adviser said. Asked when Hasina might be sent abroad, Matin replied:"Let's see what the doctors say." He told reporters that Sheikh Hasina had earlier been treated at Square Hospital as she had requested; specialist doctors and her personal physician had examined her there. Hasina was taken to Square Hospital on Feb 21 for a medical check-up, and returned to jail four hours later when all tests were complete. The former prime minister was arrested on July 16 from her 'Sudha Sadan' residence. bdnews24.c
