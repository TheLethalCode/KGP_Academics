<TITLE> Recession fears hammer Asian stocks, dollar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar slid to a 3-year low against the yen on Monday, and Asian stocks fell, with Tokyo's Nikkei shedding 4 percent, burdened by growing fears about a US recession and more writedowns in the financial sector. The dollar fell as low as 73.531 against a basket of six major currencies, taking it to the lowest since the index was started in 1973. It ploughed below 103 yen as Wall Street's sell-off on Friday prompted an unwinding of the carry trade, where investors borrow currencies with a low yield -- like the Japanese yen -- to buy high interest rate currencies. As investors grew even more risk averse, they sought safety in government bonds and gold, which hit another record high of $980.75 an ounce in Asian trade. "Gold has more room to rise considering that its pace of rise has been slower relative to other commodities. Gold should reach $1,000 very soon," said Tatsuo Kageyama, an analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo. Shares in Asia slid across the board, tracking U.S. indexes, which have fallen four months in a row, the longest string of monthly losses for the Dow and S&P 500 since 2002. Japan's Nikkei average stock price index was down 4 percent by 0300 GMT. "With a huge drop in U.S. stocks and the sharply firmer yen, the fall can't be helped. Domestic trading factors can no longer calm the market," said Yutaka Miura, deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities. "Depending on the outcome of economic indicators from now on, we may have to brace ourselves for the possibility of the Nikkei breaking below the recent low hit in January." Asian stocks outside Japan, gauged by MSCI's index, were down 2.8 percent, with the main Sydney, Hong Kong and Seoul indices all off about 3 percent. TREASURED With stocks seeing red, investors scrambled to buy sovereign debt, squeezing the yield on two-year US Treasury notes down to 1.58 percent, the lowest since early 2004. But the appetite for Japanese government bonds (JGBs) was kept in check as dealers awaited an auction of 10-year JGBs on Tuesday. "Price movements in JGBs are relatively stable compared with those stocks and US Treasuries because the 10-year bond auction is just ahead," said Makoto Yamashita, chief JGB strategist at Lehman Brothers. March 10-year futures were up 0.21 point at 138.68, after reaching as high as 138.74, their highest since January 23. Crude oil prices hovered just below an all-time high of $103.05, supported by the decline in the U.S. dollar and expectations oil cartel OPEC would leave its output unchanged. BERNANKE SNEEZES Global investors have been glued to their screens for months for any sign that the US economic malaise is spreading around the world, with a falling dollar undermining Asia's exports and pushing prices for dollar-denominated commodities ever higher. Last week's testimony by US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in which he warned some small US banks could fail and signalled more rate cuts might be needed, cemented the view the world's top economy is heading for a recession. The latest round of weak US economic data added to those fears on Friday, while a record loss at insurer American International Group Inc fuelled worries that there are more writedowns to come. Bernanke is due to speak again on Tuesday and analysts assume he will reiterate his willingness to cut rates even in the face of rising inflation
