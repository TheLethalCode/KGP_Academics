 HANOI, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top US negotiator on North Korea said on Monday that he still held out hope for resumption of six-party talks this month on a stalled nuclear disarmament agreement. The 2005 accord is bogged down over Pyongyang's failure to make a declaration by the end of last year that it had abandoned all nuclear weapons and programmes in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits. "If we can resolve these matters in the next few weeks, which I think is possible, I think we could depending on the views of the Chinese host, get together for a 6-party meeting to plan the next phase," US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said at a news conference during a one-day visit to Vietnam.

The diplomat said he was not asking Hanoi to take a role as a mediator with fellow-communist North Korea, but believed Vietnam could offer North Korea advice on developing its economy and fostering international relations. "The economy is beginning to grow in a sustained way and joining the WTO, there is a lot of inspiration for other countries in Vietnam," said Hill, whose country restored ties with Hanoi in 1995, 20 years after the US war in Vietnam ended. Last year, Vietnam Communist Party chief Nong Duc Manh visited Pyongyang and North Korean Premier Kim Yong-Il, the man in charge of economic issues, visited Vietn
