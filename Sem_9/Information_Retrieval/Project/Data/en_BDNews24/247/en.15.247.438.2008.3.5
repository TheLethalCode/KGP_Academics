<TITLE> China premier warns against Taiwan referendum </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told self-ruled Taiwan on Wednesday it cannot unilaterally decide its political future as the island prepares to hold a contentious referendum on whether to seek U.N. membership. Taiwan, which China claims as its own, is to hold the referendum alongside presidential elections on March 22, ignoring warnings from the United States, France, Japan and China. The referendum, which if passed would be perceived by Beijing to be a formal declaration of independence, is doomed whatever the outcome because China is a veto-wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. "Any issue that concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be decided by all the Chinese people, including our Taiwan compatriots," Wen told the opening of the annual session of parliament in apparent reference to the referendum. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since their split in 1949 when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island. Premier Wen said Taiwan's pro-independence activities were "doomed to fail". "Reunification of the two sides is inevitable," Wen said. He extended Taiwan an olive branch, renewing an offer to enter into negotiations. "We will work for the early resumption of cross-Strait negotiations on the basis of the 'one China' principle to address major issues of concern to compatriots on both sides," Wen said. The "one China" principle says the island and the mainland are part of a single sovereign country. Taiwan has rejected "one China" as an unfair precondition. TAIWAN REACTION An official with Taiwan's governing Democratic Progressive Party dismissed Wen's remarks. "Wen's comments are not different from in years past, but they've hardened their position, especially when they say Taiwan can't decide its future for itself," said Lai I-chung, the party's deputy international affairs director. "Taiwan needs to continue its democratic progress, continue its presidential election and continue its voter referenda," Lai added. Talks have been frozen since 1999 when then-Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui insisted that bilateral relations be described as "special state-to-state", which would imply that Taiwan was a separate country. On Tuesday, Chinese President Hu Jintao offered broad peace talks with Taiwan under the "one China" policy, but the island promptly rejected Beijing's overture. Hu, who doubles as Communist Party and military chief, also reached out to pro-independence Taiwan politicians, saying China would welcome them if they shifted their stance. But a Taiwanese defector, a member of a largely ceremonial body that advises China's parliament, said Beijing should try to understand why some politicians in Taiwan support independence. "China must be more tolerant of people who support Taiwan independence, and consider Taiwan's experience with colonialism," Lin Shengzhong told a meeting on the sidelines of the parliament, adding the island's history had been very "bitter". Taiwan was run as a Japanese colony from 1895 until 1945, when it was handed over to the then Chinese Nationalist government. The Nationalists ruled Taiwan with an iron fist after fleeing there in 1949, before embarking upon democratisation. The opposition DPP won its first presidential election in 2000 and its President Chen Shui-bian has been in power ever since. Chen cannot stand again in the upcoming election as he has already served two terms in office.
