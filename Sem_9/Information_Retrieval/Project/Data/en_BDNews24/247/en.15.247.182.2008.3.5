<TITLE> EC looks to BNP verdict to finalise election laws </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will finalise electoral laws by the end of March if the Supreme Court hands down a verdict on the pending dialogue with the BNP in time, election commissioners said Wednesday. Commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain said the commission would sit twice in dialogue with the BNP, as it had with other parties, to finalise the laws. The commission has already held two rounds of talks with all major parties except the BNP. The BNP dialogues have remained pending since the matter of their invitation hit a legal tangle, as two factions of the party claimed to be in the mainstream. Former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain leads a group known as loyalists of detained party chief Khaleda Zia while another faction is led by former finance minister M Saifur Rahman. "We will hold two rounds of dialogue with the BNP. We hope we will be able to finalise electoral laws within this month," Sakhawat told reporters. Separately, Sohul said: "The day the court delivers its verdict on this matter we will sit with the BNP the very next day." "We are now reviewing the reactions we received from the political parties during the second round of dialogues. We will finalise them after the dialogue with the BNP." Asked if local government polls would be held before the national polls or both would be staged simultaneously, Sohul said, "We are yet to make any decision on it." bdnews2
