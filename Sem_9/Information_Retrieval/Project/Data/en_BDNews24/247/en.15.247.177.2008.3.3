 Berlin, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European countries voiced hope on Monday that the election of Dmitry Medvedev as Russia's new president would ease tension and improve cooperation with Moscow despite a vote they said fell short of democratic standards. Medvedev, Vladimir Putin's chosen successor, easily won Sunday's election as expected, garnering a dominating 70 percent of the vote amid high turnout in what Kremlin opponents denounced as a one-sided farce. Germany and France made clear that the vote did not meet their own criteria for a democratic election but, alongside Britain and the European Union, acknowledged that the result appeared to reflect the will of the Russian people. "Even though I know there wasn't any real competition in this election, I think it is undeniable that Russia has voted very clearly and with figures that are very astonishing," French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told France Inter radio. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the vote showed a Russian desire for "continuity and stability". "Dmitry Medvedev has spoken out consistently in recent months about the need to modernise Russia and voiced support for the rule of law," said spokesman Thomas Steg. "The German government welcomes this and is ready to support him." Britain, whose relations with Russia were strained by Putin's refusal to hand over a suspect in a high-profile London poisoning murder, also expressed hopes of better cooperation and said Medvedev should be judged on his actions. Medvedev, who will take over from Putin in May, has pledged to continue the policies of his predecessor, who will retain power and influence in the new role of prime minister. UNEASY RELATIONS Under Putin, relations between Europe and Moscow have often been uneasy. European politicians have expressed concern over what they see as Moscow's increasingly autocratic policies. Russia is at odds with the EU over the decision by many of the bloc's members to recognise the independence of Kosovo, and has clashed with it over U.S. plans to put parts of a missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Plans by Russian gas giant Gazprom to build a pipeline through the Baltic Sea are also controversial in Europe, particularly in Poland and neighbouring Baltic countries. Perhaps mindful of these divisions, the European Commission avoided direct criticism of the way the Russian election was handled while stressing the importance of Russia following democratic values. "I am confident that under President Medvedev the Russian Federation and the European Union will consolidate and develop their strategic partnership," Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said. Both Putin and Medvedev have said they will abide by the Russian constitution, which gives the president control of foreign policy and top ministries, while leaving the prime minister to focus on the economy and social services. But there remains much uncertainty over how the two will work together given that Medvedev owes his election to Putin. "Medvedev is a politician of the young generation so this might give hope for a more democratic, European drive," said Krzysztof Lisek, the head of Poland's parliamentary foreign affairs commission. "But his Gazprom past is the reason for worries. Worries that Russian will keep using energy as a weapon and will not change its attitude on issues like the Nord Stream" pipeline.
