 KARACHI, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-terrorism court sentenced an al Qaeda-linked militant to death on Wednesday for a 2006 suicide attack in Karachi that killed a US diplomat, a government lawyer said.

"Usman Ghani got the benefit of the doubt and has been freed," he said. At the time of their arrest, police said the two were trained militants with links to al Qaeda and had fought against US forces in Afghanistan. Police said the blast, which wounded 49 people, was aimed at disrupting Bush's visit to Pakistan but he went ahead with his trip to the capital, Islamabad, as scheduled.
