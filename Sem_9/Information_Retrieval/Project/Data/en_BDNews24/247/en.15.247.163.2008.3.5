 Madrid, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain will mediate in a crisis between two of its former colonies after Colombian troops entered Ecuador to kill FARC guerrillas at the weekend, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on Wednesday. "I spoke to the Colombian (foreign) minister yesterday, and I spoke to the Ecuadorean minister yesterday," Moratinos told state radio. "We have agreed to relay talks in order to restore normal relations between two brother countries as close to Spain as Colombia and Ecuador," he added. Ecuador has broken off diplomatic relations with Colombia and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa has demanded and apology for the incursion. The crisis has pitted Correa, Venezuelan anti-U.S. President Hugo Chavez and their allies in the Andean region against Colombia, which receives billions of dollars of U.S. military aid to fight drug-trafficking and guerillas.
