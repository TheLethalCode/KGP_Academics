AC Milan have reached the quarter-finals in each of the last five seasons, going on to four semi-finals and three finals. Arsenal have kept clean sheets in seven of their last nine European matches and in their last three games against Italian teams. Arsenal, who have lost only two of their last 11 games against Italian teams, won 5-1 on their last visit to Milan when they beat Inter four seasons ago. BARCELONA V CELTIC Played: 7 Draws: Barcelona 3, Celtic 1, Draws 3 IC: R2 18.11.64 Barcelona 3 Celtic 1 2.12.64 Celtic 0 Barcelona 0 UF: R4 11.03.04 Celtic 1 Barcelona 0 25.03.04 Barcelona 0 Celtic 0 CL: GP 14.09.04 Celtic 1 Barcelona 3 24.11.04 Barcelona 1 Celtic 1 CL: KO 20.02.08 Celtic 2 Barcelona 3 Previous appearances in last eight: Champions League - Barcelona 6, Celtic 0 European Cup - Barcelona 11, Celtic 7 All European competitions - Barcelona 32, Celtic 12 Barcelona have lost only one of their last 21 European home games, conceding a mere 12 goals.
