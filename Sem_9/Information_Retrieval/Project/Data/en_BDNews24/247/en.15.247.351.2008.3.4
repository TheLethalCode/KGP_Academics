 Managua, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, a former leftist guerrilla fighter, accused Colombia on Monday of becoming a threat to Latin America by killing a top rebel commander in Ecuador and disputing territory. Colombian troops killed Raul Reyes, the No. 2 of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, on Saturday, in a severe blow to Latin America's oldest guerrilla insurgency. Reyes was killed in Ecuador in an operation that included air strikes and fighting with rebels across the border. "Colombia is becoming a factor of ... uncertainty for Latin America," said Ortega, a former Marxist revolutionary and US Cold War foe who was voted back to power in late 2006. Nicaragua is also at odds with Colombia over rich fishing waters in the Caribbean Sea. The small Central American nation has recently stepped up navy patrols in waters also claimed by Colombia to protect local fishermen and ward off drug traffickers. "We have to protect our sovereignty. You know the situation we have with Colombia," Ortega added. "Colombia is becoming a more serious problem for Latin America." Ortega is a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, whose role in negotiating the release of FARC hostages has fueled tensions with Colombia. Leftist allies Venezuela and Ecuador escalated the crisis with Colombia on Monday, cutting diplomatic ties after the Colombian raid inside Ecuador sparked troop deployments and warnings of war
