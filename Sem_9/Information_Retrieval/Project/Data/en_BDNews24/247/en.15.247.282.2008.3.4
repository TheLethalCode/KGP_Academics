 Dhaka, March 04 (bdnews24.com)The Liberation War Sector Commanders' Forum has called on people to observe a countrywide 'blackout' at midnight on March 25 demanding the trial of war criminals. The forum's chairman retired air vice marshal AK Khandaker Tuesday that a national level rally will be held in this connection on March 15 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "The present government must take steps to hold the trials. This state has been labelled 'a failed state' for failing to bring the war criminals to justice," the former sector commander told reporters at the RAOWA Club. "Commemorating the 'black night of 1971' we'll observe a blackout on the night of March 25." "We urge you all to participate, to respond to our call for the whole country to observe a minute's silence in total darkness everywhere," Khandaker said. "The chief adviser, the chief election commissioner and the chief of army staff are all for trying the war criminals," he said. "But we fail to comprehend why the government is not taking concrete steps to hold the trials." Former army chief retired Lt Gen Harun-Ur-Rashid said: "We must boycott the one political party that opposes any mention of trying war criminals." "We must identify those who fought against the cause of liberation and the government machinery must declare the anti-liberation culprits ineligible for contesting the national polls." Former sector commanders CR Dutta and Abu Osman Chowdhury, and former army chief KM Shafiullah were among the Liberation War veterans present. bdnews24.c
