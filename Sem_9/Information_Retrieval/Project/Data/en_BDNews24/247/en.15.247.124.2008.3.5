<TITLE> Clinton boosts White House bid with Texas win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Houston, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sen. Hillary Clinton boosted her White House hopes with a victory on Tuesday in the Texas contest to pick a Democratic presidential candidate, defeating rival Barack Obama in a state analysts said she needed to win to narrow his lead, US media projected. Clinton's triumph in Texas followed wins in Ohio and Rhode Island earlier in the evening, breaking Obama's month-long string of victories in the state contests to pick a Democratic candidate for the November U.S. election. The Illinois senator's streak has left Clinton trailing in the number of delegates to the summer convention that will pick the presidential candidate, and analysts said the New York senator needed to win Texas and Ohio to slow his momentum and have a chance of catching him.
