 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) -Two fifties from Imrul Kayes and Faisal Hossain Dickens powered Mohammedan Sporting Club to a six-wicket win over Partex Sporting Club in the Premier Division Cricket League Wednesday. Last year's runners-up raced to 170 for four in 30 overs in reply to Partex's 168 for seven in 33-over-a-side affair at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Put in to bat first, Partex were reduced to 12 for three in 5.3 overs and never recovered the damage though Tariq Ahmed (30) and Pakistan Rashed Hanif (68) put on 83 runs for the fourth wicket before both batsmen were run out. Ariful Islam played 28-ball 29 as the Partex went beyond 150-mark. In reply, Mohammedan also fell in trouble losing opener Rashedul Haq (1) and one-down Nadimuddin (10), but Imrul Kayes along with Roqibul Hasan tried to repair the damage contributing 38 runs before the latter was out for 16. But, Imrul and Faisal remained unbeaten to put on 107 for the fifth wicket to steer Mohammedan home with three overs to spare. Imrul hammered 66 off 81 balls that included six boundaries while Faisal played run-a-ball 51 with the help of four fours and two sixes. The second match between Abahani Limited and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan was abandoned and they shared one point each.
