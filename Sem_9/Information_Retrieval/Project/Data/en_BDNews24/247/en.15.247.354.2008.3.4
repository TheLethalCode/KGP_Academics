<TITLE> Europe shares fall as bank worries and techs weigh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as concerns about possible trading losses at banks and at their hedge fund clients undermined the financial sector, while tech shares fell after an overnight update from Intel. By 1244 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares down 0.9 percent at 1,285.89 points, having fallen back from an earlier gain of as much as 1.3 percent. HSBC was among the largest weighted drags on the broader European market, falling 1.7 percent, while Commerzbank lost 2.4 percent and UBS fell 1.3 percent. Technology stocks also suffered after Intel Corp cut its current-quarter gross margin forecast overnight, while the industry's outlook for consumer electronics dimmed along with the economy. Nokia was the biggest weighted loser, down 4.2 percent, while Alcatel Lucent fell 2.3 percent and ASML lost 2.5 percent. "The general theme still is that financials are burdened by fears of further losses and that we really do not see a big relief coming from credit markets in general," said Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit. "Fears that there is further writedowns in the financial sector, even after the Q4 earnings, are still a factor and in general you see that the spill-over effect towards more cyclical sectors is also something that will be here with us for sometime. The DJ Stoxx index of European banks was down 1.4 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 has fallen by about 14 percent this year as concern over the impact from the global credit crunch on the financial sector in particular hit equities. ING said on Tuesday it had cut its price target on the broader DJ Stoxx 600 for the last quarter of this year. "We have reduced our target for the Stoxx 600 for 4Q08 from 420 to 350 because earnings visibility remains very low," said ING strategists in a note. "Even though we believe the market is discounting much lower numbers than the current consensus, it is hard to see equities regaining previous highs until estimate momentum turns positive again." The Stoxx 600 index was trading up 0.6 percent at 316.23, having shed about 13 percent so far this year. Auto shares also featured among losers. Peugeot fell 4 percent after chief executive Christian Streiff said the French company now saw the European market flat, compared to expectations six months ago for a flat to higher market. Italy's Fiat lost 4.7 percent and BMW and France's Renault each fell about 2.8 percent. Also on the downside, German chemicals and drugs group Bayer shed 4.6 percent after a U.S. district court ruled on Monday against the validity of Bayer Schering Pharma's patent for its contraceptive drug Yasmin. But surging commodity prices helped many mining shares higher. Anglo American, Lonmin and Kazakhmys rose between 1.8 and 3.9 percent as gold and platinum roared to fresh record highs. The mining sector posted the strongest gains in Europe, rising 0.6 percent as gold neared $1,000 an ounce and platinum hovered near $2,300, while most base metal prices eased. BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining group, is talking to sub-underwriting banks on a record $55 billion loan backing its hostile bid for rival Rio Tinto, according to banking sources. BHP shares were up 0.3 percent. Oil prices were higher but building concern over commodity price inflation and its effect on economic growth dragged on shares in oil majors. BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell were down between 1 and 1.9 percent. Switzerland's Adecco, the world's largest staffing firm, was flat after saying it expected its troubled French operation to improve by mid-2008 and net profit did not fall as much as feared.
