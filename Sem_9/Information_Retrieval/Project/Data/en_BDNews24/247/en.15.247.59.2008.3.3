 LONDON, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A leaders Inter Milan suffered their first league defeat of the season while Arsenal scraped a 1-1 draw at home to Aston Villa to stay top in England by a single point. ITALY Napoli dealt Inter Milan their first league defeat of the season, with Marcelo Zalayeta chipping in the only goal after a third minute blunder by Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Csar. Inter are six points clear of AS Roma, who warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League tie at Real Madrid by thrashing Parma 4-0 on Saturday with strikes by Alberto Aquilani, Francesco Totti and Mirko Vucinic and a Giulio Falcone own goal. Fiorentina closed to within a point of third-placed Juventus after winning 3-2 in Turin. Goals from substitute Pablo Osvaldo, who was sent off for a second yellow card for waving his shirt in celebration, Papa Waigo N'Diaye and Massimo Gobbi won it for Fiorentina after Mauro Camoranesi and Momo Sissoko scored for the hosts. A tired looking AC Milan needed a Massimo Oddo penalty to salvage a 1-1 home draw with Lazio on Saturday. It was the European champions' fourth draw in five league games. ENGLAND Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League was cut to one point when they drew 1-1 with Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium and champions Manchester United won 3-0 at Fulham. Arsenal never got into their stride and fell behind when Philippe Senderos scored an own goal after 27 minutes. They had to wait until the third minute of stoppage time before Nicklas Bendtner stabbed in the equaliser. Owen Hargreaves, Park Ji-sung and an own goal from Simon Davies gave United an easy win. Arsenal have 65 points from 28 games, followed by United on 64. Chelsea, in third place, recovered from losing the League Cup final to Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, with a 4-0 win at West Ham United. Everton, who beat Portsmouth 3-1 on Sunday, are fourth with 53 points from 28 games, ahead of Liverpool (50 from 27), who won 3-1 at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. SPAIN Real Madrid restored their five-point lead over Barcelona in the Primera Liga on Saturday by edging a 3-2 win at Recreativo Huelva while the Catalans lost 4-2 at Atletico Madrid. Bernd Schuster's side had lost three of their last four league matches and looked to be in trouble when Recreativo took the lead in the first half. Brazilian forward Robinho led Real to a comeback victory with two top-class strikes after coming on as a second-half substitute in a game that featured three red cards, two for Recreativo. Barca started well against Atletico, taking the lead at the Calderon thanks to a spectacular overhead kick from Ronaldinho. Argentine striker Sergio Aguero then inspired the home side to an extraordinary fightback by scoring two goals, winning a penalty and laying on another. It was Barcelona's first loss in nine league matches and their first defeat in 16 matches in all competitions. Real lead the standings with 59 points from 26 games, Barca follow on 54 while Villarreal remain third on 47 after being held 0-0 at home to Osasuna. FRANCE Olympique Lyon geared up for their Champions League first knockout round return leg at Manchester United by beating Lille 1-0 on Saturday. The game was played at the Stade de France to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the arena where France won the 1998 World Cup. Brazilian striker Fred scored his third goal in two matches to give the six-times French champions their 17th league victory this season. On Sunday, a Wendel hat-trick gave Girondins Bordeaux a 3-0 win over struggling Paris St Germain. Second-placed Bordeaux, with 52 points from 27 matches, trail leaders Lyon by three points, a week before the two sides meet at Gerland stadium. Nancy stayed third following a 0-0 draw at Lorient on Saturday. GERMANY Bayern Munich beat Schalke 04 1-0 on Saturday to claim their first league win in Gelsenkirchen for almost a decade and maintain their four-point lead in the Bundesliga. Miroslav Klose got the only goal in the 14th minute, his first in the league since November, and Bayern were in charge for all but the last few minutes. Werder Bremen kept in the hunt by winning 2-0 at home to Borussia Dortmund, with Markus Rosenberg getting both goals. With 22 games played, Bayern lead with 47 points followed by Werder on 43.
