 LONDON, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices drifted lower on Monday, but drew some support from expectations OPEC would leave its output unchanged when it meets this week in Vienna. US light crude for April delivery was down 61 cents at $101.23 a barrel by 1055 GMT. London Brent crude was 56 cents down at $99.54. "We think there is a pretty solid consensus that the cartel is likely to leave quotas unchanged," said Tim Evans, analyst at Citi. "The high price level precludes a production cut that might otherwise be needed to limit a projected second (quarter) global supply/demand surplus." Comments from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the weekend suggested the producer group will not change output, rebuffing calls from the US to pump more oil to cool record prices of more than $100 a barrel. "It seems that things are going to be as is," Libya's top oil official Shokri Ghanem told reporters on Sunday as he arrived in Vienna for OPEC's meeting on March 5. Tensions in the Middle East, South America and Nigeria lent support to prices. "The issues are not new but they have the potential to blow up and cause supply disruptions," said Rowan Menzies, head of research at Commodity Warrants Australia. OPEC members Venezuela and Ecuador sent troops to their borders with Colombia after Colombia bombed rebels inside Ecuador. In Nigeria, attackers blew up a police houseboat on Bonny Island, an oil and gas export hub in southern Niger Delta. A fall in the US dollar to record lows against a basket of currencies also helped underpin the market. Crude oil is priced in US dollars so when the US currency declines oil prices often rise to reflect that. The weak dollar is anticipating more interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve to revive the economy in top oil consumer the United States. European stock markets had a shakey start on Monday due to renewed fears of a US recession and concerns over the banking sector. The dollar, supply disruptions from Ecuador and a fire at a European natural gas terminal helped drive oil to a record $103.05 on Friday. "From an oil perspective, this rally like that across the commodity sector, remains rampant as funds/specs continue to seek safer havens from an ailing equity market," said Robert Laughlin, analyst at broker MF Global. Crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange increased net long positions last week to the highest in seven weeks, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Frid
