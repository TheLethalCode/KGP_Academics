 LONDON, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Drax Group Plc, owner of Britain's biggest coal-fired station, slammed government plans for a "shock tax" after a year in which profit fell 16 percent. Drax, whose plant in northern England is the country's biggest single source of carbon dioxide, said on Tuesday underlying pretax profit fell to 439 million pounds ($871.5 million) in 2007 after a sharp rise in coal prices. The figure was slightly below analysts' average forecast of 454 million pounds and Drax shares fell 4.2 percent by 0834 GMT, retreating from a near six-week high of 596p set last week to value the group at around 1.9 billion pounds. Chief Executive Dorothy Thompson warned the government against any retroactive tax on profits amid rumours the Treasury is considering forcing utilities to subsidise energy bills for the poorest households. Utilities chiefs have been summoned to the Treasury in recent days to discuss "fuel poverty" and an announcement is expected in next week's budget. Britain's energy regulator Ofgem said in January power firms had made 9 billion pounds of windfall profits due to irregularities in Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme and they should be clawed back for people struggling to pay their bills. SHOCK TAX Thompson said any windfall tax would undermine investment in the quarter of Britain's power stations that need replacing by 2020. "A surprise or shock tax is very destabilising for the industry when making long term investments," she added. Thompson also said the retirement of older UK power stations would lead to a tighter electricity market, creating future opportunities for Drax, which supplies around 7 percent of Britain's power and has the flexibility to meet peaks in demand. "We believe developments in the UK electricity market will present opportunities for Drax to exploit its strategic position as a key generator," she said. The group said it would pay a final ordinary dividend of 9.9 pence per share and special dividend of 7.8 pence per share. The dividends were broadly as expected after Drax disappointed investors in December by scrapping refinancing plans that might otherwise have led to a special dividend as high as 80p. It blamed debt-market turmoil for the move. Thompson said Drax was likely to hit its target of generating 10 percent of its electricity by burning renewable fuels by 2009. Plant biomass such as forestry waste and elephant grass is seen as less damaging to the climate than coal, as it absorbs as much CO2 from the atmosphere while growing as it releases when burnt. "We're fairly certain we'll hit the biomass target by the end of 2009, and absolutely certain to get there by the end of 2010," she sa
