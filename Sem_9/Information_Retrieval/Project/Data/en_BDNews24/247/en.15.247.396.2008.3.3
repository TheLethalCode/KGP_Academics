<TITLE> Aguero's demolition of Barca fulfils childhood dream </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero fulfilled a childhood ambition with his match-winning display against Barcelona, sports daily AS reported on Monday. The 19-year-old grabbed the headlines with two goals in a 4-2 Primera Liga victory on Saturday after Ronaldinho had given Barca the lead with a spectacular overhead kick. "In Argentina I watched these types of games on the television and thought one day I hope I can play against big clubs like Barcelona and do well," the Argentine teenager told AS. "It's the best game I've played so far. I have had other good games, but Barca are one of the best clubs in the world and that makes it special. "I am pleased with the way I played but more importantly for the three points which we really needed." Ronaldinho's goal was forgotten as Aguero levelled, set up Maxi Rodriguez for the second, won a penalty for the third which Diego Forlan scored, and then brought the Calderon to its feet with a jinking run and shot from outside the area. Aguero, nicknamed "El Kun" after a Japanese comic book hero, took his league tally to 11. "My favourite was the second goal when I gave Maxi a good pass that he put away very well. It was a nice move and Maxi needed this goal. It turned the game and gave us a 2-1 lead just before halftime. I think it was the key moment." The win allowed Atletico to stay fourth in the standings but dented Barca's title challenge, as leaders Real Madrid beat Recreativo Huelva 3-2 away to move five points clear at the top. More importantly for Atletico, it gave them a psychological lift after their exits from the King's Cup and UEFA Cup, and a run of four games without a win in all competitions. Asked which of the compliments he received after the Barcelona game meant the most to him, Aguero said the ones from his godfather Dario. "He watched the game live in Argentina with all my family. They told me he went mad when I scored the fourth. He took his shirt off like I did and shouted and jumped all around the room. Being so far away, this really got to me," he said
