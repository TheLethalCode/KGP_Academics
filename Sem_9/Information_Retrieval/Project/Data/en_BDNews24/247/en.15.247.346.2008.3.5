 Washington, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, whose campaign took new life after crucial victories over Barack Obama in Ohio and Texas, said on Wednesday she was the best Democrat to beat presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in the November US presidential election. The victories for Clinton, a New York senator, snapped a winning streak by Obama and followed predictions that if she lost the big states of Ohio and Texas the former first lady would be forced to drop out of the race for the White House. The hard-fought Democratic presidential duel now moves to contests in Wyoming and Mississippi and the next major showdown in Pennsylvania on April 22, with Clinton still trailing Obama in pledged delegates who will choose the nominee at the August party convention. "I think that voters are finally focused on who they think would be the best commander-in-chief and who would be the best president to turn the economy around," Clinton, 60, said in an interview on Wednesday on NBC's "Today Show." The upbeat Clinton even acknowledged the possibility of her or Obama being the vice presidential candidate: "Well that may be where this is headed but we have to decide who is on the top of the ticket," she said on CBS's "Early Show." McCain's four big victories in Vermont, Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island drove his last major rival, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, out of the race and gave McCain more than the 1,191 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. President George W. Bush will endorse the Arizona senator at the White House on Wednesday, capping McCain's comeback from the political scrap heap last year when his campaign was down in the polls and counted out. "I am very pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence, humility and a sense of great responsibility that I will be the Republican nominee for president of the United States," McCain, 71, told supporters in Dallas. "The contest begins tonight," the former Navy fighter pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam said, looking ahead to a match-up with either Obama or Clinton in November. Clinton's wins marked the third time this year she has dodged a potential knockout blow from Obama. She won in New Hampshire after a loss in Iowa, and split the Super Tuesday contests after a blowout defeat in South Carolina. Exit polls showed strong support from voters who decided in the last few days, when she questioned Obama's readiness to be commander in chief in a dramatic television ad and cast doubt on the sincerity of his pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is blamed in Ohio for manufacturing job losses. "I think last night I proved that I'm the person most likely to win for the Democrats," Clinton said on Fox News. "It's finally ... focused on the real differences between me and my opponent and the differences between us and Sen. McCain. I think that's good for me as we move forward." Asked if she thought voters were having second thoughts about Obama, Clinton said on NBC: "I think they are starting to ask some hard questions and I think voters want this race to go on because they are now really concerned about who can best go against Sen. McCain." BROAD BASE OF SUPPORT Clinton's win was built with support from a broad constituency of men, women, the elderly, Hispanics, working-class Democrats and rural voters, exit polls showed. Under Democratic rules allowing the losers in each state to win a proportional number of delegates, Clinton must win many of the remaining contests by big margins to have a shot at significantly closing the gap with Obama in the delegate race. "The bottom line is, that we are in a very strong position," Obama, 46, said on the "Today Show." "Sen. Clinton barely dented the delegate count yesterday ... This process is going to ultimately be about who has the most delegates." In an interview on MSNBC, the first-term senator from Illinois voiced optimism: "We are steadily building a lead and I think we're going to win this thing ... I think it is going to be hard for us not to be the nominee." An MSNBC count gave Obama 1,307 delegates to Clinton's 1,175, both still far short of the 2,025 needed to win the nomination. The final delegate apportionment from Tuesday's contests was still being calculated. Clinton also captured Rhode Island and Obama scored an easy win in Vermont. In his victory speech, McCain took aim at both of his likely Democratic opponents and criticized their pledges to revisit U.S. trade treaties, punish companies that send jobs overseas and withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. McCain has had trouble winning over conservatives unhappy with his views on immigration, his past opposition to Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 and his criticism of some religious conservative leaders as "agents of intolerance" during his failed 2000 presidential campaign.
