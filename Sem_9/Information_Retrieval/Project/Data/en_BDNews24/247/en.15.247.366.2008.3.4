<TITLE> Fundamentals to boost Kenya economic recovery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disrupted by violence in much of January, Kenya's economy is set to rebound mainly because the positive fundamentals of the past few years are still in place. Hopes are high for a quick recovery but depend on serious commitment by Kenya's rival political parties to reforming the government, electoral laws, and the constitution, analysts said. The wrangling parties have stitched together a pact to end a stalemate over who won the Dec. 27 election by creating a new prime ministerial job for Raila Odinga, who has said President Mwai Kibaki entrenched himself in power by stealing the election. "If tourism comes back because of renewed confidence, then the drivers of economic growth will be in place. The fundamentals are still there," said Sunil Sanger, managing director of local brokerage CFC Financial Services. However, if it is to attain the double digit economic growth needed to lift the country out of poverty, the government should prioritise repairing and expanding its tattered infrastructure, Sanger added. The country's economy has grown by an average 5 percent annually in the last five years. Tourism, the country's main earner, shrivelled at the height of the peak season as tourists cancelled their holidays when they saw television footage of rioting and ethnic violence that killed more than 1,000 people. Other leading foreign exchange earners such as tea and horticulture were also affected by the bloody violence but have already recovered greatly. In an interview with Reuters over the weekend, Odinga said Kenya could restore confidence among international investors and lure back tourists within six months. ECONOMIC DISRUPTION Strategically placed as a gateway to much of east Africa, Kenya remains a hub for regional business despite the upheaval, analysts said. "From an investment point of view, Kenya still remains the driving force in east Africa. We expect strong economic growth post the peace accord," said Roelef Horne, a portfolio manager for Investec Asset Management. However, further wrangling is likely despite the deal signed last week because some controversial issues are yet to be tackled, a report on emerging markets by Citibank said on Monday. "Arguments over who gets which cabinet post, notably that of finance minister, look set to continue for a while," the report said, adding that a well-funded emergency recovery programme by donors was likely to take place. "With a concerted effort to market Kenyan tourism in the coming months, all this would imply that in Q1 macro data will be poor, but it should be more positive in Q2, with a potentially strong economic pick-up in H2." The disruption on economic activity is likely to cost Kenya 260 billion shillings ($3.8 billion) in the first half of the year, according to a Kenya Association of Manufacturers report. It said 100 billion shillings were lost in January alone. Some analysts said an initial public offer of the Safaricom mobile phone company, anticipated to be the country's biggest yet, should be delayed a while longer to build confidence. "We need to observe for at least two months that the agreement is holding," Sanger said. "It should not be rushed ... because of the size of the issue, and the importance of the issue, they need to attract large offshore interest in the IPO. Kenya's markets took a battering after the Dec. 27 election but have since rallied. The stock market sank 16 percent to a low of 4,576.31 points at the end of January, from 5,444.83 points on the last day of trading before election. But it was down just 5.6 percent on December on Monday when it closed at 5,142.83. The shilling slid to a near three-year low of 74.40 versus the dollar at the end of January but has since rallied to close at 66.65/75 on Tuesday compared with 62.65/75 on December 24, the last day of trade before the election.
