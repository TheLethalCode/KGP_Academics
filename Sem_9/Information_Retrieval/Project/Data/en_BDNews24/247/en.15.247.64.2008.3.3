 BAGHDAD, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used a visit to Baghdad on Monday to tell the United States to get out of Iraq and the region, saying its presence there had brought only destruction and division. "Iraq throughout history has been against foreigners and occupiers," Ahmadinejad said at a news conference on the second day of his state visit to Iraq, the first by an Iranian leader since the two neighbours fought an eight-year war in the 1980s. During his two-day trip, Iran and Iraq signed seven agreements on customs, transportation links and improving cooperation in industrial development, highlighting the new, closer relations between the former arch-foes. "We believe the powers that came over the seas travelling thousands of kilometres, these powers should leave this region and hand over the affairs to the people and governments in the region," Ahmadinejad said in translated remarks. "The power that is far from our region must allow countries of the region to manage their own affairs. This foreign power must not interfere in the affairs of states, because the governments and the states are capable of running their own affairs." Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called on the United States, Iran's long-time enemy, to pull out its more than 150,000 troops in Iraq, saying its presence is to blame for sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis. "People have not seen anything from the foreign presence in this region but more destruction and division," he added. "UNIFIED IRAQ A GIFT" Washington accuses Tehran of fuelling violence and undermining Baghdad's government by arming, training and funding Shi'ite militias in Iraq, a charge Tehran denies. The two countries are also at odds over Iran's nuclear programme. Analysts say Iran wants a stable if not necessarily strong Iraq while making life uncomfortable for US forces in Iraq. "A unified and independent Iraq is a gift to the region," said Ahmadinejad, who described his visit on Sunday as opening a new chapter in relations with Iraq. Both Iran and Iraq are run by Shia majorities and many of Iraq's Shia leaders were in exile in Iran during Saddam's rule. The countries also have historical economic, political and cultural links. Analysts say Ahmadinejad's visit shows Iran's growing influence in the region, while his presence in Baghdad as a guest of the Shi'ite-led government undercuts Washington's assertions about Tehran's backing for local Shi'ite militias. The Iranian president has sought to counter U.S. efforts to isolate Tehran over its nuclear programme, which Washington says is for nuclear weapons, by trying to improve ties with Arab states in the region. The UN Security Council is expected to vote on Monday on a third round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States says is for nuclear arms. Official and pro-government media in Iran have given Ahmadinejad's visit extensive coverage. The official daily, Iran, carried the banner headline "Baghdad's historic day" and its commentary highlighted the fact that Arab leaders have not yet made such a trip to Iraq. While there have been scattered protests by Sunni Arabs, dominant under Saddam, against his visit, Baghdad's Shia newspaper al-Byyna al-Jadida praised Ahmadinejad in an editorial: "Ahmadinejad challenged all the security issues, complications ... and the bombs planted here and there, while no Arab leader or king or Muslim has come to Baghdad," it
