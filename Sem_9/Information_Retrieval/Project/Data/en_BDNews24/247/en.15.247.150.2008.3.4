<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of South African women demonstrated at a commuter taxi rank on Tuesday, calling for an end to harassment for wearing miniskirts, SAPA news agency reported. The protesters, wearing miniskirts themselves, marched to the central Johannesburg taxi rank where a young woman wearing a miniskirt was attacked and sexually assaulted last month by taxi drivers who said she was indecently dressed. The march is the second this month after the incident, which has highlighted the issue of women's rights in a country where sexual violence against women is rife. The latest official statistics available show that nearly 23,000 women were raped in the six months to the end of September 2007.
