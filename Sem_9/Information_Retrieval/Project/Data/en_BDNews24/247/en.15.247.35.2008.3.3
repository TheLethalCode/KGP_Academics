<TEXT>
 Athens, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Greek leftist group claimed responsibility for a botched bomb attack on the environment ministry on Monday which caused no injuries and minor damage, police said. It was the second strike in less than 10 days on the ministry by the group calling itself the Armed Revolutionary Action, which attacked a tax office a year ago. The attackers placed a home-made explosive device outside the building but only the detonator went off, causing minor damage at the building's glass entrance. The group called a newspaper 20 minutes before the blast warning of the explosion and claiming responsibility.
