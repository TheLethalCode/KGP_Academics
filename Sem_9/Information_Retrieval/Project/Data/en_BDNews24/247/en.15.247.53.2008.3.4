 Chittagong, March 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Tuesday announced a 14-member ODI squad for the three one-day internationals against visiting South Africa, bringing four new faces in the fold. The three-member selection committee led by Rafiqul Alam declared the squad at the Peninsula hotel in the port city Tuesday. The new faces are middle order batsmen Nazim Uddin, Roqibul Hasan, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and all-rounder Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. Syed Rasel and Shahriar Nafees also returned to the fold though they were overlooked for the New Zealand ODI series in December last. Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, Rajin Saleh, Sajedul Islam and injured Aftab Ahmed, who were in the Test squad, were also dropped. "There is no doubt that Mushfiqur is a talented player, but he did not come up to the mark during the New Zealand tour that we expected of him. Though he did well behind the wicket, he failed miserably with bat," Rafiqul Alam said. "Mushfiqur was replaced by Dhiman Ghosh, who is a hard hitting batsman and got the placement following his superb performance in domestic cricket over the last two years," the chief selector explained. "We suffered a big blow with the injury of Aftab in the second Test and Nazim Uddin is his substitute, who has a similar attacking batting style to Aftab and was the top run scorer in the first class competition this year," Alam said. "We considered Mahmudullah Riad, who is a solid batsman and good fielder, but Musharraf Hossain got in through the sheer weight of his performance in domestic, A team and Academy matches," said the former national player. "This is the best available team this time and we want to keep these cricketers together over the next two to three years," said the 50-year-old former national cricketer. Tushar Imran, Javed Omar, Sajedul Islam and Mehrab Hossain Junior, who were members of the New Zealand ODI squad, were also overlooked for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa, beginning on March 9 at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. The selection committee picked one specialist spinner, three pacers and as many all-rounders as possible for the side. The squad comprises: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Nazim Uddin, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Dhiman Ghosh, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Mosharraf Hossain, Syed Rasel, Farhad Reza and Roqibul Hasan. The selection committee also announced a 13-member warm-up squad including nine players from the ODI squad. The warm-up match is scheduled for March 7 in Chittagong. The warm-up squad consists of: Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Nazim Uddin (vice-captain), Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Roqibul Hasan, Nayeem Islam, Mahmudullah Riad, Dhiman Ghosh, Farhad Reza, Mosharraf Hossain, Syed Rasel, Sajedul Islam and Rubel Hossain. bd
