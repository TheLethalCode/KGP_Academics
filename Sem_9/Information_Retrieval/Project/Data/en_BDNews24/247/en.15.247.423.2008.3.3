 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed called on the Bangladesh Rifles Monday to be ready to assist the nation in holding free, fair and neutral elections. The chief adviser made his comments at the Rifles Week 2008 Darbar at the border security force's headquarters in the city. Fakhruddin told BDR personnel that the present caretaker government was working towards holding the national polls by December at the latest. He said a congenial atmosphere for the election would be created by maintaining a stable society. Maintaining peace, discipline and security as well as checking militancy and terrorism are all important roles for the BDR, Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser reminded the BDR of their historic role in the birth of the nation. "March is the month of our glorious independence. On March 23, 1971, two days before the declaration of independence, members of the then EPR hoisted the flag of an independent Bangladesh for the first time," Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser went on to laud the role of the BDR's predecessor during the Liberation War. "They fought for nine long months alongside other forces and the people for the liberation of the country," he said. "The sacred duty of protecting the country's border lies with the BDR. Putting a stop to smuggling and crime as well as maintaining internal peace and discipline are prerequisites for the socio-economic development of the country," he said. Fakhruddin told the gathered BDR personnel that the border security force's facilities and benefits had been recently augmented by his administration. He asked the BDR to remain vigilant in the border areas when the state of emergency is relaxed and the national polls draw near. bd
