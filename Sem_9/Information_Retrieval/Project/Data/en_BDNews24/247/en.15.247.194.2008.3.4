 LONDON, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British building materials group Travis Perkins flagged lower profits for this year, blaming a weaker housing market, but said it was outperforming rivals as it posted 2007 profits near the top end of forecasts. The firm, which runs over 900 builders depots and around 200 Wickes home improvement stores, said on Tuesday that its markets were slowing and leading economic indicators suggested they were likely to get worse. But it also said conditions more closely resembled the slowdown in early 2005, rather than the housing market recession of the early 1990s. "No one can be sure ... But our judgment is it's more like 2005 than the early 1990s," Finance Director Paul Hampden Smith told Reuters. Travis Perkins, whose shares have fallen around a half in value over the past year on concerns about the housing market slowdown, said profit before tax and one-off items rose 18.7 percent to 261 million pounds ($518 million)last year. Analysts' forecasts ranged from 251 million to 263.5 million pounds, according to Reuters Estimates. Hampden Smith said the group had taken around 2 percentage points in market share from rivals, driven by strong demand for its tiling and workwear products as well as improvements in its availability of stock. Travis Perkins' rivals include builders merchant Wolseley and home improvement chains B&Q and Homebase, owned by Kingfisher and Home Retail respectively. SLOWING MARKETS "Our early sales performance in 2008 reflects the expected slowing of market growth," the firm said in a statement. Like-for-like sales in January and February were up 5.7 percent at its builders' depots and up 0.9 percent at Wickes -- around 3-4 percentage points below the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. Hampden Smith said he expected growth in like-for-like sales at the builders' merchant business this year, but that they could fall marginally at Wickes. He was also comfortable with analysts' current consensus earnings per share forecast for 2008, which he said was around 144-145 pence, compared with the 149.8 pence posted last year. However, Landsbanki analyst Simon Brown had feared worse. "We currently have a decline in full year pretax (profit) of 6 percent to 245 million pounds, but this may be revised upwards on the back of better than expected current outlook comments," he said. At 0855 GMT, Travis Perkins shares were up 1.9 percent at 1,090 pence, outperforming a 0.8 percent rise on the FTSE-250 midcap index and valuing the business at about 1.4 billion pounds. The firm proposed a dividend of 44.9 pence a share, up 20.1 percent on 20
