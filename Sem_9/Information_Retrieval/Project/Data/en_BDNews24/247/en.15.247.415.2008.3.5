<TITLE> Japan stocks seesaw, end lower on economic concerns </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended slightly lower at a six-week closing low on Wednesday as weaker-than-expected company spending data dampened investor confidence about the health of the domestic economy. Strong gains in Fast Retailing Co Ltd on an upbeat earnings outlook and in trading houses such as Marubeni Corp were offset by falls in financials such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group on a darkening economic outlook and lingering global credit market jitters. "A downward revision to GDP is inevitable after the weak corporate capital spending data," said Harushige Kobayashi, head of research department at Maruwa Securities. Japanese companies cut spending on plant and equipment more than expected in the final quarter of 2007 compared with a year earlier, pointing to a downward revision to growth and underlining views that the Bank of Japan will leave interest rates on hold for some time. After ending flat in the previous session, the benchmark Nikkei share average continued to gyrate between positive and negative territories, with caution taking the upper hand. "We have no choice but to sit back and see," said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager of investment management division at Chuo Mitsui Asset Management. "Investors know shares are cheap but cannot bring themselves to actually buy them." Investors also held back ahead of a raft of U.S. economic data, including the Institute for Supply Management's monthly survey of service sector activity later in the day and Friday's employment report for February. Tomomi Yamashita, fund manger at Shinkin Asset Management, said the cautious mood was also heightened as it neared the March business year end, when Japanese institutional investors are seen likely to sell shares ahead of closing books. "There are few buyers. The current market is not where investors are actively taking risks, because they are not accompanied by returns," he said. The benchmark Nikkei average ended down 0.2 percent or 20.22 points at 12,972.06, the lowest close since Jan 23. The broader TOPIX index was down 0.1 percent at 1,263.91. Fast Retailing rose 3 percent to 7,560 yen, becoming the biggest positive contributor to the Nikkei 225, after the operator of the Uniqlo clothing chain beat its first-half sales target and a newspaper predicted it would top its profit forecasts. Top bank Mitsubishi UFJ fell 2.3 percent to 881 yen, No. 2 Mizuho Financial Group dropped 3.1 percent to 403,000 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the third-biggest bank, shed 1.4 percent to 707,000 yen. Trading house Marubeni jumped 8.5 percent to 864 yen and Mitsui & Co climbed 4.9 percent to 2,350 yen. These trading houses are considered natural-resources-related stocks since they have stakes in overseas oil fields and mines. "In addition to rising resources prices, the trading firms are considered better positioned to withstand inflation unlike manufacturers," said Maruwa's Kobayashi. GAME SHARES SCORE HIGHER Nintendo Co Ltd and other video game makers gained ground after Daiwa Institute of Research raised its mid- to long-term investment rating on the game sector to "outperform" from "neutral". Daiwa expects brisk demand for game software as sales of new game consoles are set to grow further. It also said game makers' earnings are little affected by the overall economy, a positive trait in an economic downturn, and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates have limited impact on Nintendo and other game makers. Nintendo shares jumped 3.9 percent to 53,500 yen in Osaka. Konami Corp also rose 3.9 percent to 3,720 yen, and Capcom Co Ltd climbed 4.8 percent to 3,040.. Beverage maker Ito En Ltd plummeted 11.9 percent to 1,789 yen, having touched a four-year low of 1,778 yen after reporting a 10.8 percent drop in nine-month operating profit to 15.6 billion yen due to higher marketing and crude oil costs. JP Morgan downgraded the bottled green tea drink and fruit juice maker to "underweight" from "neutral" and lowered its target price to 1,530 yen from 2,500 yen on rising prices for raw materials such as juices and coffee beans as competition heats up. Trade was moderate on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 1.95 billion shares changing hands, compared with last week's daily average of 2.1 billion shares. Declining stocks beat advancers by a ratio of nearly 2 to
