 Cairo, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, her credibility at stake, urged Israelis and Palestinians on Tuesday to quickly resume US-sponsored peace talks suspended over Israel's offensive in Hamas-run Gaza. "Negotiations ought to resume as soon as possible," Rice told reporters travelling with her to Cairo, the first leg of a brief Middle East trip aimed at salvaging the US-brokered peace process. She will also visit Jerusalem and the West Bank. "I will be talking about how we can get the negotiations back on track," she added, before a refuelling stop in Brussels. While calling for an end to violence that has killed almost 120 Palestinians -- around half of them civilians -- Rice did not specifically demand a cease-fire. The omission may anger some Arab allies who could see it as giving Israel a green light for more military action in Gaza. Israeli troops pulled out of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip on Monday after international appeals, but a senior official said it was a "two-day interval" during Rice's visit and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would not tolerate attacks. Washington's role as an honest broker is under the spotlight in the current Gaza conflict because of its close ties to Israel. Rice came under heavy criticism during the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war for not demanding a cease-fire. She strongly rejected parallels with the Lebanon conflict and said she would discuss with Egypt's foreign minister and president how best to reduce the violence, as well as ways to secure Egypt's border with Gaza, briefly breached in January. Rice said there was merit to the idea of giving the Palestinian Authority control at the sensitive border crossing at Rafah and having European monitors return. Hamas, however, has demanded a role at the border, largely closed since June. "I will certainly be discussing how we make the Rafah situation sustainable and what would mean for a role for the PA, for European monitors on that border," Rice said. She also voiced concern about the loss of innocent life in Gaza and the humanitarian situation there, which she said would be brought up in all her discussions. Egypt has been looking at how to get a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel but Rice declined to use the word cease-fire, which would involve directly negotiating with Hamas, a group Washington brands as terrorist and refuses to deal with. "Call it what you will; we want the violence to stop. But first and foremost you have to get Hamas to stop firing rockets into Israeli cities," Rice said. HAMAS 'SPOILERS' Saying Israel had the right to defend itself, Rice called Hamas "spoilers" in Palestinian statehood negotiations between Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who froze talks last weekend in protest over the Israeli offensive. Rice said any lengthy suspension of talks handed victory to Hamas, which seized control of Gaza last June and whose stepped up rocket attacks into Israel preceded the latest offensive. "Hamas is doing what might be expected, which is using rocket attacks on Israel to arrest a peace process in which they have nothing to gain," Rice said. Experts say Rice faces an uphill battle to revive the peace talks -- launched to much fanfare last November, in Annapolis, Maryland with the goal of getting a Palestinian statehood deal before the Bush administration's term ends in January 2009. "I continue to believe that they can get to a deal by the end of the year if everybody has got the will to do it," said Rice, adding implementation of a deal would take a lot longer. She dismissed sceptics who have predicted the Annapolis process will fail without including Hamas and that US attempts to isolate Gaza will ultimately backfire. "It is going to have its ups and downs. There will be good days and bad days and even good weeks and bad weeks. I am going to talk to the parties about staying focused on what needs to be done here," she said. The Palestinians have complained the Israelis have not met their promises to ease roadblocks and allow easier access in the West Bank and to cease Jewish settlement activity. Rice said there were responsibilities on all sides that had to be met. "Thus far there is room for improvement on both sides," Rice said. After spending several hours in Cairo, Rice is set to move on to the West Bank to see Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad later on Tuesday. She will then go to Jerusalem for talks with Israeli leaders, before leaving for Brussels on Wednesday for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers
