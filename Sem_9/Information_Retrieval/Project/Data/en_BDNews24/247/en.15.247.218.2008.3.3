 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)Awami League leaders and other politicians Monday met AL general secretary Abdul Jalil, now on one-month parole for medical treatment abroad. Updates with details Jalil was quoted by one of the leaders who visited him at LabAid Cardiac Hospital as expressing "disappointment over allegations of corruption" against him. "I have been fighting corruption all through my life but now I am accused of it," Jalil was quoted by Bangladesh Workers Party general secretary Bimal Biswas as saying to the leaders of three parties. Biswas told bdnews24.com: "He asked all to pray for him." Bimal was accompanied by Communist Party of Bangladesh president Monjurul Ahsan Khan, general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim and Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua. Jalil's son Nizamuddin Jalil told bdnews24.com that his father did not discuss politics with the leaders. "I was present there." Also, Mujahidul Islam Selim said: "We did not have political talks. We only discussed his health and physical condition." The AL general secretary, whose health has been critical in recent days, was released Sunday on one-month's parole for overseas treatment of a severe kidney condition. His family will take him to Singapore Monday night. Jalil's personal secretary Md Akram Hossain told bdnews24.com Monday: "Jalil and his wife will leave Dhaka at 11:55pm by Singapore Airlines." "He will be taken straight to the airport from LabAid Hospital and admitted to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore," Hossain said. He said that Jalil was not on life support at present but required oxygen. Although Jalil was initially set to spend Sunday night at his Gulshan home after release, deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters that doctors had decided to keep him in the hospital under medical observation overnight. Joint forces arrested Jalil on May 28, 2007, from his office at the Mercantile Bank headquarters in the financial district of Motijheel. The Anticorruption Commission later filed a graft case against the AL general secretary with Ramna police on Dec 18. Jalil was accused of illegally acquiring property worth Tk 65.29 lakh and concealing information on assets valued at Tk 63.82 lakh in a wealth statement submitted to the ACC. The ACC sent a wealth statement notice to Jalil and his family members on Aug 8, asking them to submit details of their movable and immovable assets. bdnews24.com/ehb/sum
