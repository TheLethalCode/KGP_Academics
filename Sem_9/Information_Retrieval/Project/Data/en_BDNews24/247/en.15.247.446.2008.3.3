 Jabalya, Gaza Strip, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinians were in no mood on Monday to argue the wisdom of rocket attacks on Israel as they surveyed the aftermath of a five-day Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. "Are you happy Hamas?" asked one woman, referring to the Islamist group in control of the territory, as she walked cautiously down a road torn up in the fighting. Three other women rushed towards her. Pushing her aside, one of them shouted: "Are you senile? Hamas is the best." Israeli forces killed more than 100 Palestinians during the operation in the northern Gaza Strip, where Hamas and other militant groups frequently launch rockets at southern Israel. Hamas said about half of the dead were civilians. Venturing out after Israeli armour and infantry withdrew at dawn, Palestinians examined damage caused to dozens of houses. It was the kind of misery that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah faction lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas in fighting last June, had said "useless" rocket fire on Israel would bring. But revenge appeared to be the dominant sentiment among the inhabitants of the northern Gaza Strip. "I have always been a sharp opponent to rocket firing but now I call on Hamas, Fatah, the Islamic Jihad and everyone who can make and fire a rocket, please do," said Abu Ghazi, 35. His family of six had a close call when a missile landed near their house during the Israeli operation. Some homes were also damaged by rocket-propelled grenades that militants fired at Israeli soldiers who commandeered rooftops. "An eye for an eye and a missile for a missile. Let them be terrorised like we have always been," he said, drawing a chorus of "Yes, yes, let them hit Ashkelon" from people standing nearby. The major southern Israeli city was struck by longer-range Katyusha rockets during the Gaza incursion. Taxi driver Mohammad Salem summed up the feeling of many residents as he contemplated the civilian casualties, which included women and children. "Did they fire rockets?" he asked. Israel's defence minister Ehud Olmert had said Hamas bore ultimate responsibility for the deaths of innocents because its fighters operated in heavily populated neighbourhoods.
