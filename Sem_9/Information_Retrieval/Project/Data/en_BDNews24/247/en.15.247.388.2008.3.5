<TITLE> Britain to auction Tote bookmaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain put the Tote state-owned bookmaker up for sale on the open market on Wednesday after finally rejecting a bid from a racing industry consortium. The Tote, set up in 1928, runs Britain's pool betting system, has around 540 betting shops and operates at all 59 UK racecourses as well as offering online betting. The government said it would appoint advisers to look at its options for the Tote but said it intends to prepare for an open market sale and would start taking indicative offers straightaway. The news confirmed what industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Wednesday's move is the latest twist in a near three-year saga over the Tote. The decision to auction it on the open market will enrage the racing industry and the government is likely to face a backlash for going back on past promises. The government pledged to sell the Tote to the racing industry in 2001, but a deal in 2005 was scuppered when the European Commission said the price was so low it constituted state aid. Following the Commission's ruling, PricewaterhouseCoopers valued the Tote for the government at a reported 400 million pounds ($795 million) and invited the racing industry to put together a bid. The government rejected an initial offer of around 320 million pounds in 2006 before the consortium came back in tandem with Tote management and made another bid early in 2007, with financial backing from the private equity arm of Lloyds TSB. However, the government was unhappy with the level of Lloyds TSB's involvement and the consortium was told to rework the plans, leading to a new bid being put forward last September. IN THE RUNNING Gambling firms, private equity firms and multi-millionaire racing tycoons are all expected to be in the running to buy all or parts of the Tote although competition laws effectively rule out Britain's two biggest bookmakers, William Hill and Ladbrokes . Private equity-owned Gala Coral has already offered to buy the business while BetFred and Paddy Power are also among gambling firms expected to be keen on its shops. With worries that gamblers will rein in spending if the UK economy weakens and the credit crisis drying up funds for buyers like Gala Coral, analysts say the Tote will fetch far less than originally hoped, however. Some say between 200 million and 300 million pounds would be a reasonable price tag, less than the government was offered by the consortium. Racehorse Owners Association President Paul Dixon has also put together a plan which would see the Tote split. Half the business would belong to a racing industry trust which would pump money back into racing while the rest would be controlled by an industry consortium.
