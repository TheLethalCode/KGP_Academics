 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Private banks are set to turn in a proposal on interest rate cuts to the central bank for approval Monday. The retail banks agreed to cut the interest rate on loans by a minimum of 1.0 percentage points, according to a decision taken by bank owners and executives Sunday. The move is aimed at fuelling investments in the sluggish private sector. The commercial banks will also slash different service charges, according to the decision taken at a meeting of the Bangladesh Association of Banks, an organisation of owners, BAB chairman Nazrul Islam Mazumder said. The members of Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), consisting of top bank executives, also attended the meeting. Mazumder told bdnews24.com: "We will keep the interest rate on deposits the same as now. But the interest rate on loans will come down to 14-15 percent from 16 percent now, which will narrow the interest rate spread." According to the proposal, no banks will be allowed to slap more than a 15 percent interest rate on loans for borrowers. The banks also agreed to introduce a uniform system for different costs and commissions they charge clients for providing services, including opening letters of credit. bdn
