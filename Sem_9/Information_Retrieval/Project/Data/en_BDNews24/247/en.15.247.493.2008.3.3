 KABUL, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan said on Monday it was stunned by a US intelligence assessment that the Afghan government controlled only 30 percent of the country and Taliban insurgents held 10 percent, calling the report totally baseless. The assessment by the US Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell last week came amid warnings by Western think-tanks, politicians and diplomats that Afghanistan could revert to becoming a failed state and slide back into anarchy.

"While in America an administration fully backed by tribal chiefs or dominated by tribal chiefs may be seen as liability, here we see it as a strong asset," Saleh said. When asked why his account of the Afghan government's control differed so much from that of McConnell, Saleh said: "I am in touch with reality. I am sitting in Afghanistan." In the last two years, Afghanistan has gone through its worst period of violence since US-led and Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001. More than 11,000 people have been killed since 2006, the drugs industry is booming, corruption is rife and frustration is high among ordinary Afghans about the lack of security and development six years after the Taliban were removed from pow
