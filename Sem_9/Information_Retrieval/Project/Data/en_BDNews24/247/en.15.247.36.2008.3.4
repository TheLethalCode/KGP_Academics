<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) - An unbeaten 65 from Habibul Bashar powered newcomers Surjo Torun to a three-wicket win over City Club in the curtailed-over match at Narayaganj Osmani Stadium Tuesday. City Club put up a paltry total of 149 for eight in the stipulated overs after opting to bat first as the match was curtailed to a 39-over-a-side affair due to wet outfield following the overnight rains. City Club, who have reached the Twenty20 League final, fell in trouble to lose both openers inside 10 runs in the face of fierce bowling from pace duo Delwar Hossain and Mohammad Sharif. Pakistani Zahoor Elahi (28) and Golam Mabud (23) repaired the damage to put on 47 runs for the third wicket before Zahoor was removed by Nazmul Hossain, who also dismissed Mabud. Sumon Barua (29 not out), Arafat Salahuddin (20) and Rashedul Islam (12) chipped in with some runs before Nazmus Sadat wrecked up the middle order. Delwar (2/34), Shahrif (2/30), Nazmul (2/25) and Nazmus (2/34) shared eight wickets to damage City innings. In reply, Surjo Torun also faced same problem losing both openers for 11 runs as medium pacer Salahuddin made the inroads into the opponents' batting line-up before Safaq Al Jabir rattled the middle order to reduce Surjo Torun to 21 for five in nine over. However, two former Bangladesh skippers Habibul Bashar and Khaled Mashud Pilot put on 80 runs for the sixth wicket before the latter was Salahuddin's third victim for 40 off 74 balls featuring four fours. Bashar, however, stuck to an end to steer Surjo Torun home remaining unbeaten on 65 with six balls to spare. Bashar hammered six fours facing 89 balls.
