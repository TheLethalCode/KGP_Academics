<TITLE> Russia's Medvedev on course for presidency </TITLE>

 Christian Lowe MOSCOW, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev was elected by a big margin to succeed Vladimir Putin as Russian president, exit polls and early results showed on Sunday, after a vote that will preserve his mentor's power but which opponents said was unfair. Medvedev, a 42-year-old who has worked at Putin's side since the 1990s, will take over the trappings of the presidency from his patron but it was still unclear which of the two men would really be in charge. Half an hour after polling stations closed, state television broadcast a pop concert in Red Square. It began with a song whose chorus was "Forward, Russia" -- Medvedev's unofficial campaign slogan. Defeated Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov said he planned legal action over irregularities, though he did not challenge the overall result. Western monitors were preparing to issue a tough verdict on a vote they say offered people little real choice. But Russia voters are enjoying the biggest economic boom in a generation and most see Medvedev as the best hope of prolonging their new prosperity. He has asked the 55-year-old Putin to be his prime minister and promised to continue his mentor's policies. "I think that he (Putin) will, at least at the beginning, be the key figure," said Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-linked political analyst and parliamentarian. An exit poll by state-run pollster VTsIOM gave Medvedev 69.6 percent of the vote. His nearest challenger, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov had 17.2 percent. In the official count, Medvedev was leading with 64.86 percent after 20 percent of polling stations had been counted. The outgoing president, barred by term limits from running in this election, will step down in May and move the short distance down the Moskva river to the prime minister's office in the government headquarters, known here as the White House. The handover has been smooth for now but observers question how Putin and Medvedev will make their double act work in a country which is used to having a single, strong ruler. ONE-SIDED Medvedev's victory follows a one-sided campaign in which the former corporate lawyer refused to take part in televised debates and enjoyed lavish coverage on state television. Opposition parties and civil society groups reported that many state sector employees had been coerced into turning out to vote for Medvedev. "This is a secret service KGB operation to transfer power from one person to another," ex-premier Mikhail Kasyanov, who was disqualified from the ballot, told Reuters. "It has nothing to do with elections". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the one-sided nature of the campaign did not mean the contest was not fair. Medvedev's victory has been seen as a foregone conclusion since the popular Putin -- credited at home with restoring Russia's might on the world stage and stamping out the chaos of the 1990s -- endorsed him for the Kremlin top job last year. In the village of Anino, north of Moscow, 82-year-old Yevdokiya Andreyeva was shocked to discover Putin was not on the ballot. Told his protege was running instead she said: "Fine. It will be Medvedev then." Investors are watching closely between now and Medvedev's inauguration to see who he will be in his government, with the focus on whether Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, seen as the architect of financial stability, will keep his job. Kasyanov warned inflation was a major problem on the horizon for Medvedev. "Inflation is the factor that is not under the control of this administration and it will become the main question that will spark a political crisis. By October, it will become unbearable for the public," he said. Russian gas giant Gazprom, of which Medvedev is chairman, was preparing to reduce supplies to pro-Western neighbor Ukraine over a debt dispute at 0700 GMT on Monday, in what some observers see as a show of strength. Medvedev has signaled he will continue with Putin's assertive foreign policy and has modeled his domestic agenda on Putin's own program. But some observers believe the choice of Medevedev could be part of a plan by Putin for a shift in emphasis after 8 years in which the Kremlin has single-mindedly consolidated its power over the media, politics and strategic sectors of the economy. Medvedev has emphasized the importance of using Russia's oil wealth to improve peoples' living standards, and said he wants to loosen the state's control over big corporations.
