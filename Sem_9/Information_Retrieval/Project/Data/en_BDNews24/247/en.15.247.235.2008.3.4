<TITLE> Obasanjo`s power at stake in Nigeria party polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abuja, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's ability to influence the government behind the scenes is at stake on Saturday when Nigeria's ruling party chooses new leaders, party members say. The People's Democratic Party (PDP) won a landslide victory last April in disputed elections for president, state governors and state and federal legislators in Africa's most populous nation and top oil exporter. In play on Saturday are positions that come with a degree of influence over government policy and control over the PDP purse strings. But the party is divided along many fault lines and preparations for the national convention have been messy. In some states, rival factions held parallel congresses and picked competing lists of delegates. There have also been a few deaths in local power tussles over who should vote on Saturday. One of the key issues is the role of Obasanjo, who as president imposed a group of his allies as party leaders through "consensus" rather than election, and who later appointed himself head of the Board of Trustees, a post he still holds. It is an open secret that Obasanjo has been campaigning for his ally Sam Egwu, a former state governor, to become the new party chairman. "It is incongruous. As an elder statesman he should be advising government in private, he should not hold a partisan position," said former Senate President Ken Nnamani, a member of the PDP National Executive Council. Nnamani said he feared another back-room deal rather than a fair election on Saturday. "I am afraid the party is not poised to regain its democratic credentials. The outgoing leadership, which is the only group that has power in the party, did not come in by democratic means," he said. President Umaru Yar'Adua, who took office on May 29 last year, was hand-picked by Obasanjo to be the PDP candidate in the presidential election and some party members told Reuters they worry that Obasanjo retains undue influence over his successor. CONSULTATIONS Yar'Adua has asserted his independence from Obasanjo by adopting a humble, law-abiding attitude that contrasts sharply with his predecessor's flamboyance and habit of ignoring procedures to push his policies through. Yar'Adua has also reversed some of Obasanjo's more controversial decisions. However, anti-Obasanjo politicians complain that many of the most powerful people in Yar'Adua's entourage, such as his national security adviser and chief of staff, are the same men who held those posts under Obasanjo. Obasanjo opponents told Reuters that because Yar'Adua believes in due process, he consults with party organs over important decisions such as the appointment of ministers, therefore giving influence to party officials such as Obasanjo. A senior party member who will vote on Saturday said the field was wide open because Yar'Adua was maintaining a hands-off attitude and there was a swell of opinion against Obasanjo. "Nobody can tell who will win. Many people owe their positions to Obasanjo so they feel they have to be loyal to him. But there are also many who are angry with him and who feel they can stand up to him and defeat Egwu," he said.
