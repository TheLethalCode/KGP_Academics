<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Mallorca scored two quick-fire goals late in the second half to spoil Getafe's impressive run of recent form and earn themselves an entertaining 3-3 draw at the Coliseum on Sunday. Getafe had looked to be on course for an easy win after strikes from Mario Cotelo and Juan Albin and an own goal from Ivan Ramis had put them 3-1 up against the islanders, who were reduced to 10 men when Lionel Scaloni was sent off late in the first half. But Mallorca were thrown a lifeline 13 minutes from time when striker Juan Arango let fly with a superbly struck free kick from 25 metres out. Two minutes later the Venezuelan international provided the assist for defender Ivan Ramis to skim a header into the net after another great free kick. Despite the draw Michael Laudrup's Getafe, who are in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup and on the verge of a securing a place in the final of the King's Cup for the second season in succession, remain in 10th place in the table. They are a point clear of an improving Real Betis who crushed relegation-threatened Real Murcia 4-0 in Seville. Real Zaragoza slumped to their fourth defeat in a row when they went down 2-1 away to basement side Levante and Javier Irureta's side are now only clear of the drop zone on goal difference. At the other end of the table, Racing Santander moved back into the European places with a 1-0 victory at Valladolid, Argentine midfielder Aldo Duscher striking a late winner when he ballooned a shot into the far corner.
