 LONDON, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index fell 1.85 percent by mid-session on Monday, led by banks and commodity shares as investors fretted about a looming US recession and credit-related writedowns by financial firms. HSBC bucked the weakness, up 0.8 percent after the global banking group said its profit rose 10 percent last year, as strong gains in Asia helped it absorb a $17.2 billion hit for bad debts due to US housing market problems. The bank's full-year dividend rose by 11 percent. At 1116 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 108.6 points at 5,775.7, on course for a four-day losing run. The UK benchmark index lost nearly 9 percent in the first two months of the year. European shares also fell sharply by midday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday as another round of weak economic data added to U.S. recession fears and a record loss at insurer AIG underscored worries about more writedowns in the financial sector. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average fell 4.5 percent on Monday as the dollar hit a three-year low against the yen. "What it all means is that the Federal Reserve is going to have to lower interest rates," said Mike Lenhoff, chief market strategist at Brewin Dolphin. "The market's growing conviction about a U.S. recession is really at the heart of it." Futures now give a 74 percent chance the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate by a further 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's next rate-setting meeting on March 18. Oil and gas producers were the top losing sector, shaving more than 19 points off the index, as crude prices traded below $102 a barrel. BP shed 1.8 percent, while Royal Dutch Shell lost 1.7 percent and gas producer BG Group dropped 1.3 percent. Miners also suffered on concerns about global growth. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Kazakhmys and Lonmin were down between 1.2 and 2.7 percent. Xstrata slipped 1.7 percent after its 13 percent rise in annual net profit fell slightly short of market forecasts, and it gave little detail about talks regarding a possible takeover by Brazil's Vale. WEAK BANKS Banks were another standout loser, with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB, Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Standard Chartered each shedding between 2.1 and 6.3 percent. Other financial stocks also fell. Hedge fund group Man Group lost 4.1 percent, while insurer Aviva fell 3.2 percent and Standard Life slipped 3.5 percent. Pearson was down 3 percent after it trimmed its revenue growth outlook in some areas after announcing above-forecast profits. Defensive drugmakers were up, with GlaxoSmithKline adding 0.4 percent and Shire gaining 0.1 percent. Mid-cap Cobham advanced 2.9 percent after it said its equipment had been selected for the US Air Force tanker programme. It said the total value to the company over the life of the programme would be up to $1 billion. European credit spreads widened on revived concerns about bond insurers. The investment grade Markit iTraxx Europe index was at 135 basis points, about 8 points wider from late Friday. "The corporate news is not that bad," Lenhoff said. "What we really have got here is the indiscriminate degradation of the credit markets ... It's the credit market victimising the equity marke
