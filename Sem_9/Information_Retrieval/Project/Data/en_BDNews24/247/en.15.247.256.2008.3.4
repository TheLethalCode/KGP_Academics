 London, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks turned lower again on Tuesday on renewed concerns about banking stress and volatile trading conditions for hedge funds as commodity and currency markets gyrated following months of credit market turmoil. U.S. stocks were pointing to a lower opening on Wall Street, with investors on the alert for more signs of trouble for the economy and banking system. The potent rally in commodities, meanwhile, showed no sign of slowing with resources from platinum to rice at or near record highs, propping up mining shares but unable to halt broader European stock losses. An ailing dollar won brief respite from successive falls to record lows versus the euro and a basket of major rival currencies, as euro zone officials expressed concerns about the single currency's sharp rise. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.25 percent at 1,281.30 points, helping safe-haven European government bonds to rise. HSBC was among the largest weighted drags on the broader European market, falling 2.41 percent, while Commerzbank lost 2.9 percent and UBS fell 2.9 percent. "Fears that there are further write-downs in the financial sector, even after the Q4 earnings, are still a factor... you see that the spill-over effect towards more cyclical sectors is also something that will be here with us for sometime," said Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit. The dollar had plumbed record lows versus the euro and a basket of currencies for five straight sessions as worries about the U.S. economy sapped sentiment, but euro zone officials broke the malaise with concerns about the single currency's climb. The euro's surge beyond $1.50 prompted verbal intervention by euro zone finance ministers as well as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. The euro stood at $1.5216, flat on the day, but still fairly close to the $1.5275 high set the previous session according to Reuters data. The dollar's trade-weighted index against six major currencies was at 73.561, slightly above the 73.354 it hit on Monday, its lowest level since it was created in 1973. SOARING COMMODS The greenback's recent woes have added fresh fuel to fired-up commodity markets, raising the allure of dollar-denominated resources including gold, platinum, food commodities and crude oil. Spot platinum, elevated by solid fundamentals as well as investment interest due to a power crisis in top producer South Africa, hit a record $2,275 per ounce. While oil held above $102 a barrel, off a record near $104 posted in the previous session. The Baltic Exchange's chief sea freight index, which gauges the strength of major trade routes for bulk commodities, has powered up by an eye-watering 40 percent in the last six weeks. Analysts said current lofty levels were not a deterrent to further gains, with global economic uncertainty hastening the need for portfolio diversification. "I think we can drop the word 'alternative' from commodities now," said Ross Norman, managing director of TheBullionDesk.com. "This year is psyching itself up to be the year that inflation re-emerges as a major topic. In that scenario people are looking to invest in hard assets that hold their value better than some other financial products," he said. The broad commodity rally, including grains, even fanned out to rice futures, which hit record highs for the third day in a row on Monday. Although gold hit a record above $980 per ounce on Monday and is on track to reach $1,000, the metal is still some way off the inflation-adjusted high of $2,187 per ounce, which expresses the 1980 peak of $850 in today's money.
