<TITLE> OPEC set to hold output steady, but on alert </TITLE>

 Vienna, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - OPEC ministers gathered in Vienna are inclined to keep output steady, but are on alert for signs record high oil and economic slowdown could erode demand. The price of U.S. crude hit a record $103.95 on Monday and was still near $103 a barrel on Tuesday. OPEC ministers have said prices have been driven by factors beyond their control, such as a weak dollar and speculation, and not by any lack of oil. President of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Chakib Khelil said Wednesday's meeting would decide to keep output policy the same. "No change," he told reporters. But ministers are expected to call another meeting soon and to keep monitoring the impact of a U.S.-led economic slowdown and a seasonal decline in oil consumption. "The economic slowdown in the United States definitely has an effect on world economic growth, which will have an impact on world petroleum demand this year," Khelil said. OPEC's most influential member Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has made no public comment since his arrival in Vienna on Monday. Speaking before leaving Tehran, the oil minister of Iran, OPEC's second biggest producer, said he would support a cut in output because the market is well-supplied. But on arrival in Vienna, he refused to be drawn, saying only that OPEC would consider all the factors that affect the market. RE-RUN OF LAST MEETING? A no-change decision would mark a re-run of OPEC's last session on Feb. 1 when it again held output steady. But a major difference between then and now is that the oil price is around $10 a barrel higher. Consumers, led by top fuel burner the United States, have called for an increase in output to try to halt the rally, which they see as dangerous to a fragile world economy. Some market players have also said more oil could have a calming effect. "I think no change is factored in. An increase would I think lead to larger stock builds in Europe and the U.S. and I think would make for lower prices," said Christopher Bellew of Bache Commodities. "Even with no change the recession in the U.S. should adversely impact demand and could in itself increase the rate of stock building." A senior Gulf OPEC delegate told Reuters the market was adequately supplied and predicted rising stocks following the end of winter. "It's (the stock build) going to be more than 1 million barrels per day during the second quarter, which is the normal pattern. There seems to be no need for a change in output at this time," he said.
