 HONG KONG, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears of a US recession sent the dollar to a 3-year low against the yen on Monday, driving Japanese shares down more than 4 percent and fuelling a rush for gold, silver and safe-haven government bonds. European shares were set to follow Asian markets lower, with financial bookmakers expecting losses of 1.2-1.9 percent for major markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris as the dollar's tumble unnerved investors. The dollar fell as far as 73.531 against a basket of six major currencies, the lowest since the index was started in 1973. It ploughed below 103 yen as Wall Street's 2-percent-plus sell-off on Friday prompted an unwinding of the carry trade, where investors borrow currencies with a low yield -- like the Japanese yen -- to buy high interest rate currencies. "With a huge drop in U.S. stocks and the sharply firmer yen, the fall can't be helped. Domestic trading factors can no longer calm the market," said Yutaka Miura, deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities. "Depending on the outcome of economic indicators from now on, we may have to brace ourselves for the possibility of the Nikkei breaking below the recent low hit in January." The weak dollar, which has fallen five yen in the past five sessions, hurts Asian exporters in particular. Risk averse investors sought safety in government bonds and gold, which hit its fourth straight record high at $983.90 an ounce. Silver in hot pursuit, breached $20 an ounce for the first time since 1980. "Gold has more room to rise considering that its pace of rise has been slower relative to other commodities. Gold should reach $1,000 very soon," said Tatsuo Kageyama, an analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo. Crude oil prices hovered just below an all-time high of $103.05, supported by the decline in the U.S. dollar and expectations oil cartel OPEC would leave its output unchanged. STOCKS HAMMERED Shares in Asia slid across the board, tracking U.S. indexes, which have fallen four months in a row, the longest string of monthly losses for the Dow and S&P 500 since 2002. Japan's Nikkei closed down 4.5 percent and Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 index fell 3 percent, with a few gains among miners drowned out by the selling of banks and retailers. "Until we see the financial market normalise, it is hard to see equities stage any significant recovery from here," said Credit Suisse equities analyst Adnan Kucukalic in Australia. Asian stocks outside Japan, gauged by MSCI's index, were 3 percent lower by 0634 GMT, with Hong Kong and Seoul stocks down more than 2 percent. With stocks seeing red, investors scrambled to buy sovereign debt, squeezing the yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes down to 1.58 percent, the lowest since early 2004. But the appetite for Japanese government bonds (JGBs) was kept in check as dealers awaited an auction of 10-year JGBs on Tuesday. BIG FED CUT EXPECTED Many in the market now expect the US Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark federal funds rate by 75 basis points from 3.0 percent at its policy meeting later this month The market had widely expected a 50-basis-point cut last week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week reinforced expectations of more rate cuts when he warned some small US banks could fail and signalled more rate cuts might be needed, cemented the view the world's top economy is heading for a recession. The latest round of weak US economic data added to those fears on Friday, while insurer American International Group Inc's record loss added to fears of more writedowns. Recession-watchers will keep an eye on the Institute for Supply Management's February reading on US manufacturing later on Monday, before turning their nervous attention back to Bernanke, who is due to speak again on Tuesday. Analysts assume he will reiterate his willingness to cut rates even in the face of rising inflati
