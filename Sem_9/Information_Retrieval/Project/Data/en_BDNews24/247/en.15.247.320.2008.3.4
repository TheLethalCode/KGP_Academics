 MADRID, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid are pinning their hopes of overturning a 2-1 first-leg defeat by AS Roma and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals on the return of Robinho and a flawless display in defence. The Brazil forward had an instant impact when he reappeared after a two-week injury lay-off during Saturday's 3-2 win at Recreativo Huelva. He put Real ahead with almost his first touch after coming on as a substitute and then scored another with a classy finish. His return was particularly timely given that leading striker Ruud van Nistelrooy was out injured and remains a doubt for the Roma match, while pacy winger Arjen Robben suffered a serious ankle strain which will sideline him for several weeks. "Robinho is a really important player for us and we need him," midfielder Guti told sports daily Marca ahead of Wednesday's match at the Bernabeu (1945 GMT). "When he's playing we can rest at ease. He can turn matches and score goals. He's a phenomenon." As well as having to unlock the Roma defence, the nine-times European champions' chances of making the last eight for the first time in four seasons will depend largely on being able to keep a clean sheet against the free-scoring Italians. "A 1-0 win will be enough, but we know we are up against a good team and that we cannot afford to make any mistakes," said Guti. "The key is not to let them score." Real's back four have made some costly errors in defence in recent matches and they will be heartened by the return of Portugal centre-back Pepe after a month out injured, but influential right-back Sergio Ramos is suspended. ATTACKING POWER Although they have a good home record against Italian clubs, Real will be aware that they have beaten Roma only once in three previous Champions League meetings in Madrid. Roma issued a clear warning of their attacking power by thrashing Parma 4-0 on Saturday to cut Inter Milan's lead at the top of Serie A to six points. They may be tempted, however, to take a more cautious approach against Real, recalling the 7-1 drubbing they suffered at Manchester United in the quarter-finals last season when they also had a 2-1 lead from the first leg. Striker Francesco Totti, who is returning to his best after a back problem and scored a fine strike against Parma, is taking heart from the memory of a goal that gave Roma a 1-0 group-stage win in the competition at the Bernabeu in October 2002. "I have already scored an historic goal at the Bernabeu and I hope to score another," he told reporters. "Roma just need to play as they know how to. If we are concentrated we'll be able to have our say." Full-back Marco Cassetti is out with a shoulder injury, Brazilian defender Juan is battling to return to fitness from a foot injury and Chilean midfielder David Pizarro is also a doubt. Centre-back Matteo Ferrari and Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani are favourites to step in if they fail to make it. Probable teams: 1-Iker Casillas; 22-Miguel Torres, 5-Fabio Cannavaro, 3-Pepe, 16-Gabriel Heinze; 6-Mahamadou Diarra, 8-Fernando Gago, 14-Guti, 10-Robinho, 7-Raul, 17-Ruud van Nistelrooy or 19-Julio Baptista Roma: 32-Doni; 2-Christian Panucci, 5-Philippe Mexes, 4-Juan, 22-Max Tonetto; 11-Taddei, 16-Daniele De Rossi, 7-David Pizarro, 20-Simone Perrotta, 30-Mancini; 10-Francesco Totti. Referee: Kyros Vassar
