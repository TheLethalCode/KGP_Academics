<TEXT>
 Chittagong, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  Visiting South Africa wrapped up the two Test series against Bangladesh 2-0 on Monday, inflicting an innings and 205 run defeat to the hosts on the morning of the fourth day in the second and final Test at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. It was the 31st innings defeat out of the 53 Tests that Bangladesh have played since 2000. This was also the 15th time the Tigers have conceded innings on the fourth day, while they have gone down on the third day of innings on 14 occasions. Bangladesh, having resumed the day on 54 for five, needing 270 to avert the innings defeat, folded at 119 as the Proteas took 63 minutes to pick up the remaining wickets in the port city. Left-arm spinner Robin Peterson raised his tally to five for 33 from two for eight to complete his first five-wicket haul, eclipsing his previous best of 3 for 46 also against Bangladesh in Dhaka, 2003. The left-arm spinner dismissed overnight Mushfiqur Rahim (4) on the day's fourth ball and his first delivery as the young batsman got an outside edge to be caught by Kallis at the first slip before Mohammad Rafique (0) gave a return catch to Peterson two balls later. Shahadat Hossain showed enough bravery to have hammered four boundaries before he was caught by Ashwell Prince at long-off for 24 trying to play Peterson for a lofted shot. Morne Morkel took the last batsman, Mahsrafee Bin Mortaza, having him caught by Neil McKenzie at gully to end Bangladesh's second innings, as Aftab Ahmed did not appear due to eye injury by a short bouncer off Jacque Kallis the day before. Graeme Smith (232 runs) and Daley Steyn (14 wickets) have been named man of the match and man of the series respectively. Bangladesh scored 259 in the first innings and 119 all out in the second innings after South Africa declared their first innings at a monumental 583 for seven. The Tigers lost the first Test in Dhaka by five wickets. The visitors will play a one-day warm-up match on March 7 before the first one-day international on March 9 at the same venue. The second and third ODIs are scheduled for March 12 and 14 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. bd
