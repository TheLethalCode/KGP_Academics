<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Monday ordered the government to submit a gazette notification for supporting officials and staff recruitment for judicial magistrates on March 5. A seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division chaired by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin made the order and adjourned proceedings until then. The latest order came as the government had apparently failed to meet Monday' deadline for the notification to the court in this regard. On Feb 26, the Supreme Court ordered the government to issue the staff recruitment rules and present them to the court on March 3. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal assured the court that the government was in fact complying with the earlier order, saying: "The chief adviser has already approved the recruitment rules for appointing the staffers for the judicial magistrates." "The president signed the rules Sunday night," the attorney general said, presenting the documents to the court signed by the chief adviser and the president. "The gazette in this regard will be published today (Monday)," he said. The appellate bench ordered the government to promulgate the recruitment rules, publish the gazette and submit the same to the court on Wednesday (March 5). Talking to bdnews24.com after the court proceedings, the attorney general reaffirmed that the rules would be published by gazette on Monday. On Dec 12, the Supreme Court ordered the government to provide judicial magistrates with support staff, vehicles and other requirement in line with a Ministry of Establishment letter, dated Oct 28. The court set the government successive deadlines to implement the order. The caretaker government officially announced separation of the judiciary from the executive branch on Nov 1, last year. bdnews24
