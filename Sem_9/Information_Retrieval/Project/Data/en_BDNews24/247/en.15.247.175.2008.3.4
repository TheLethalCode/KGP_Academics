 SEOUL, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea, whose import bill is soaring with record high oil prices, will freeze domestic utility charges at least through the first half of the year to keep a lid on rising inflation, officials said on Tuesday. The government has already announced plans to cut average taxes on domestic fuel sales by 10 percent -- President Lee Myung-bak's first major policy measure since taking office last week. "It's important for the government to curb inflation now because we have the election and wage negotiations coming up," said Lim Ji-won, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. Lee's conservative Grand National Party is hoping to take control of parliament from its liberal opponents in the April 9 election. Though analysts say its chances of doing so are good, recent opinion polls suggest it will have to work hard to win over voters. Lee's popularity rating is currently just under 50 percent, well below that of recent predecessors at the start of their terms in office. After the election, come the annual private-sector wage negotiations. One major labour union group has already verbally clashed with Lee and warned of rocky relations with the new president who has blamed labour strife for getting in the way of investment. The Finance Ministry said power tariffs, highway tolls and prices for other services controlled by the government would be frozen at least for the first half. It also wants to bring down communications costs by liberalising prices and making it easier for new companies to enter the sector. "Public utility prices are always important because they become the basis for other private-sector service charges," said JPMorgan Chase's Lim. "As long as the government can improve the fiscal spending structure and save money from that, this kind of measure will of course help prevent expectations about future inflation from growing fast." South Korea, almost completely reliant on imports of increasingly expensive energy and grain, is worried the mounting import bill will bite into consumer spending just as a slowing global economy looks set to start hurting exports. Government data on Monday showed that while inflation fell on in February from January it was still close to a three-year high and had remained above the central bank's target. President Lee, whose promises to lift up the economy gave him a landslide win in December's presidential election, on Monday ordered ministers to focus policy on stabilising living conditions. Most economists, and even the central bank, predict that economic growth will almost certainly fall short of the 6 percent Lee's government has targeted for this year. They say domestic investment and consumption will not be able to increase enough to offset the damage from weakness elsewhere in the world, and especially if the US economy tips over into recession. But Lee has stuck to his target, promising to trim corporate taxes and make it much easier for companies to do business to help push the economy to average annual growth of 7 percent over the next decade compared with about 4.5 percent in the past 10 yea
