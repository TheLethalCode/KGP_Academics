<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla will have to adjust their sights lower after Fenerbahce beat them in a penalty shootout to knock them out of Champions League last 16, goalkeeper Andres Palop said. The hero of last year's UEFA Cup final, when Sevilla retained the trophy in a shootout against Espanyol, Palop was unable to repeat the feat when the Turkish side forced extra-time and penalties on Tuesday. "It's tough to take after two years of always winning and getting to the final," he told the club's Web site (www.sevillafc.es). Brazilian forward Deivid's 79th minute goal at the Sanchez Pizjuan levelled the aggregate scores at 5-5 after Fenerbahce, who had won the first leg 3-2, recovered from 2-0 down and then 3-1 down, to 3-2. Instead of Palop, it was Volkan Demirel who grabbed the headlines when he saved three spot kicks to put Zico's side into the quarter-finals for the first time. "We didn't want to go to penalties it is a lottery," Palop added. "We were lucky once, but not this time. It's a huge disappointment but it isn't a failure. A failure would have been to go out in the group stage. "We need to pick ourselves up quickly and focus on the league now to see how far we can go. We know our objective is to qualify for the Champions League again." Sevilla are already out of the King's Cup and are 20 points behind Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid, in seventh. If they are to make up ground in the league, coach Manolo Jimenez pointed out that the side would need to improve in the way the way they defended. "Perhaps it is a failing we have that we don't know how to play when the result is in our favour. The team always wants to press forward and our opponents cause us a lot of problems with counter-attacks," he said. "And we seem to have a mental block when it comes to defending set pieces. This is starting to be costly. We need to work to overcome it." Both of Deivid's goals for Fenerbahce came from dead-ball situations
