<TEXT>
 London, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The mother of missing 9-year-old Shannon Matthews said she believed her daughter was being held by someone who knows her and pleaded for her release in an emotional appeal on Monday. Karen Matthews said Shannon was not the sort of girl who would go running away from their home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. "Somebody out there has got Shannon. It has broken the family apart -- the family don't feel safe any more. "I think that somebody out there who knows Shannon and probably knows me as well (has got her)... I just want her home safe. "It makes me think now I can't trust the people who are close to me any more." Holding her daughter's small teddy bear, Matthews said: "Whoever's got Shannon, please let her go." The girl went missing nearly two weeks ago on her way home from school in Dewsbury after going on a swimming trip. Despite a huge police search, no sign of her has been found. Matthews said she was comfortable with police looking into any possible criminal connections in Shannon's wider family. "Whatever police need to do to help find Shannon, they can go ahead and do it," she said Her father Leon Rose, who lives ten miles away in Huddersfield with Shannon's older brother, said he had been out looking for her every night, handing out posters and appealing for information. He said the "littlest detail" could make a difference in the search. The Sun newspaper has offered a 20,000 pounds reward to help find the schoolgirl
