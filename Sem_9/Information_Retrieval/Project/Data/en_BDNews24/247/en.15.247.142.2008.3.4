 BEIJING, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Tuesday condemned the annual Pentagon report to the US Congress on Chinese military power, saying it was a distortion of the facts, interfered in the country's internal affairs and showed "Cold War thinking". Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang added that Beijing had made "solemn representations" to Washington about the report and also denied Beijing was engaged in cyberwarfare. "This U.S. report advocates the China threat theory and is seriously not in accordance with the facts and interferes in China's internal affairs," Qin told a news conference. "We demand the U.S. abandons Cold War thinking and correctly recognises China and China's development and revises the mistaken ways of the report," he added. "We are extremely dissatisfied."

Qin said that was just an excuse. "I want to stress that we oppose some countries or some people using so-called 'transparency' to propagate the so-called 'China threat theory' and interfere in China's internal affairs," he said. Despite the latest round of accusations, the United States and China have been working closer together in recent years on military issues after decades of open hostility. Last week, the two sides signed an agreement to set up a defence hotline. Qin suggested that telephone link was no use if such remarks kept coming out of the United States. "If there is a Cold War of the mind," he said, tapping his head, "there will be no use for a hotlin
