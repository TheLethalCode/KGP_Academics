 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)US Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi stressed the critical role of the media in a democracy, speaking Tuesday on the 50th anniversary of Voice of America's Bangla-language broadcast. "A free press is the lifeblood of democracy as it acts as the primary source of information to people," Pasi said at a ceremony to mark the occasion. "The news media serve as the watchdogs for democracy through monitoring government activities. They give voice to ensure human rights are protected and serve as a check against corruption as well as abuse of power," Pasi said. The diplomat added that the US government supports press freedom as an integral part of her country's efforts to promote human rights and democracy worldwide. VOA Bangla service chief Iqbal Bahar Choudhury and VOA director Danforth W Austin and former caretaker government chief adviser Habibur Rahman also spoke at the programme held at the Westin Dhaka. Danforth W Austin in his speech thanked VOA's partners in Bangladesh as well as the Bangladeshi media for cooperating with the long-running American service. Austin later told bdnews24.com that VOA considers the Bangla speaking community worldwide as well as in Bangladesh a "very good market" with further untapped potential. "We are weighing for further expansion other than working with partners in this country," Austin said. Iqbal Bahar Choudhury said that local broadcasters Radio Today and Radio Amar are presently working in collaboration with VOA. "Currently [the two local radio stations] broadcast a half-hour programme produced by VOA everyday and we intend to take this initiative further," he told bdnews24.com. Media personalities, prominent newsmen, and members of the civil society also attended the ceremony to celebrate VOA's Bangla service which began its journey in 1958. bdne
