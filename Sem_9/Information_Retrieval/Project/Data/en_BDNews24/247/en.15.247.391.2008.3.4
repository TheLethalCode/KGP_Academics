<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar fell agonisingly short of back-to-back centuries after helping India post a healthy total of 258 for nine in the second tri-series final against Australia on Tuesday. Tendulkar followed up his unbeaten hundred in Sunday's six-wicket win in Sydney with a patient 91 to leave the tourists in a strong position to wrap up the best of three final series. India had looked like they were heading to a much bigger total in Brisbane when Tendulkar and Robin Uthappa (30) piled on 94 for the first wicket before Australia's bowlers struck back. Part-time spinner Michael Clarke (3-52) captured three wickets, including the prize scalp of Tendulkar, while paceman Nathan Bracken (3-31) also picked up three wickets in the frantic final few overs. Tendulkar was untroubled as he cruised to his half-century off 70 balls but missed out on his hundred when he misjudged a delivery from Clarke and spooned a catch to a diving Ricky Ponting at mid-on. Yuvraj Singh made a run-a-ball 38 in a 54-run stand with Tendulkar but their dismissals triggered a lower-order batting collapse. The Indians lost six wickets for 50 runs in the last 11 overs after looking as though they would get closer to 300. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni kept the tail wagging with 36 from 37 deliveries but received little support from his team mates as the Australian bowlers stemmed the run flow. Australia need to win the match to square the series and force a deciding game in Adelaide on Frida
