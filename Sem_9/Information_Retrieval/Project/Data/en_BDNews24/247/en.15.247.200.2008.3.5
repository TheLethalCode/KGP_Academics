 TEHRAN, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian delegation arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday for a new round of talks with US officials on security in Iraq, an Iranian news agency said, but an Iraqi official said no date for the meeting had been set. Easing a diplomatic freeze between Washington and Tehran lasting almost three decades, Iranian, US and Iraqi officials held three round of talks in Baghdad last year on ways to help end violence in Iraq. A meeting scheduled for last month was postponed by Iran for what it called technical reasons, prompting Washington to question Tehran's commitment to dialogue. "Based on the prediction of the Iraqi government the fourth round of ... talks about Iraq's security ... is supposed to take place on Thursday," Reza Amiri-Moghadam, head of the Iranian delegation, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency.

Diplomatic ties between the two countries, now embroiled in a deepening standoff over Tehran's disputed nuclear ambitions, have been frozen for almost three decades. The United States accuses Iran of destabilising Iraq. Tehran blames the U.S. military presence for the unrest and says it wants a stable and secure neighbour.

It was the first trip to Baghdad by a president of the Islamic Republic, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. ISNA said the security talks would be held at the level of experts, but the Iraqi spokesman said he expected them to take place at both ambassadorial and security committee level. The US military last month said it had proof Iranian-backed Shia Muslim militias in Iraq were increasingly using secret weapons stores to attack US and Iraqi forces. Washington says the militias get weapons, funding and training from Iran. Iran regularly dismisses such charges. The United States also accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear bombs.
