<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)The government is exploring the possibility of reopening decommissioned jute mills in a bid to reinvigorate the ailing sector, textiles and jute adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Monday. "The measures to be finalised and implemented soon will retain 50 percent of the factory workers on a permanent basis, and reduce huge ongoing losses in the sector," Anwarul said following a meeting with the jute secretary and the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation chairman. "A further measure is to offer employment to retrenched workers on an 'earn as you work basis'," the adviser said. BJMC chairman Ataharul Islam said the labour unrest in the sector had been largely due to some employees taking advantage of the stalemate over outstanding wages and allowance arrears. "The situation has to be handled judiciously, that's why a tripartite meeting between mill owners, workers and the government will be held on March 5 at the Khulna Circuit House to resolve the stalemate," Ataharul said. The BJMC chairman added that surplus workers receiving excess wages on the regular payroll had to be removed, while 50 percent of the workers would be retained as permanent staff. bdnew
