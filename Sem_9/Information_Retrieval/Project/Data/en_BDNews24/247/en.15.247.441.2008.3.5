<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsene Wenger's said he believed his Arsenal side were destined for greatness but Tuesday's Champions League win to eliminate holders AC Milan at the San Siro proved his young guns had come of age. An impressive 2-0 victory, albeit against an ageing Milan team far from their best, was the perfect riposte to the critics who had questioned Arsenal's staying power after a poor run of domestic form. Two successive league draws and a 4-0 drubbing by Manchester United at Old Trafford in their FA Cup fifth round tie on Feb. 16, hot on the heels of a 5-1 rout by London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup in January, had threatened to derail Arsenal's season. But Wenger never lost faith and was rewarded with a display on Tuesday that must rank as one of the best European away performances by any British side. "The players grow. I feel they deserve a lot of credit, because our confidence level in the camp has dropped a bit," Wenger said after late goals from Cesc Fabragas and Emmanuel Adebayor sent the Premier League leaders through to the quarter-finals 2-0 on aggregate. "We have not been in the most positive environment recently, from the media. But I like the fact the team finds the mental strength to play without restriction." With Fabregas dominant in midfield, Arsenal were able to re-discover their eye-pleasing passing game that had Milan on the backfoot long before the Spanish midfielder stunned the San Siro with a rasping drive that left Milan keeper Zeljko Kalac flapping. Milan had Brazilian midfielder Kaka, the World Player of the Year, along with Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso but in Fabregas Arsenal had a player who exposed the Italian side's deficencies with a commanding display. "Sometimes as manager, you feel there is something in the team and you know that for them to get a step higher up they have to deliver in a big game like tonight," Wenger said. "I hope this will strengthen the belief in the team." A first win by an English side over Milan at the San Siro will give Wenger's side renewed confidence that they can reach a second Champions League final in three seasons. Their domestic rivals for the Premier League title will also take heed
