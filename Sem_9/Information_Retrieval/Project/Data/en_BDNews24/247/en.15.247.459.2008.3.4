<TITLE> Asia stocks dip, eyeing costlier commodities </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most major Asian stock indexes dipped on Tuesday, as concern about weaker demand from the United States was compounded by record-high commodity prices, which will send costs for many companies spiralling higher. Although financial bookmakers were calling European markets slightly higher, given their heavy weighting in oil and resources stocks, they cautioned that any further bad news from a bank or an insurer could see markets turn around. Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 were seen rising between 0.2 and 0.4 percent. Investors, who have one eye on a US economy which is in, or entering a recession, are also concerned about the impact of rising costs for raw materials, such as platinum and gold, crude oil, tin and palm oil. But the gains in commodities left some analysts puzzled. "The rally defies conventional thinking. Each time lousy (economic) numbers come out, prices go higher. Even when Warren Buffett said the United States is in recession, the market just went barreling ahead," MF Global analyst Edward Meir said. MSCI'S measure of Asian stocks outside Japan fell 0.5 percent as of 0220 GMT, after already suffering its biggest one-day percentage drop in six weeks with a 3.1 percent fall on Monday. CATCH A U.S. COLD MSCI's Asian index has dropped more than 11 percent this year, in part dragged lower by the financial sector and export-reliant companies as investors fret about a slowing U.S. economy, which U.S. billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday labelled as "in a recession". Still, some pockets of economic strength in Asia are supporting stock markets, for example, South Korea. Seoul shares rose 0.3 percent after data showed the country's industrial output increased a much stronger-than-expected 2.5 percent in January after seasonal adjustments. Among the few other gainers, shares in Taiwan rose 2.5 percent as blue chips gained ahead of the presidential election this month. Japan's Nikkei average ended flat after hitting a six-week low earlier in the session, as some exporters rose on the back of a more stable yen, although financial shares remained weak amid continued credit concerns. Japan's Sony Corp and South Korea's Samsung Electronics both gained on reports they would likely invest $1.9 billion jointly for a new production line for red-hot flat screens. But credit and subprime concerns remain at the top of the watchlist after U.S. mortgage lender Thornburg Mortgage Inc plunged on Monday on worries it was facing bankruptcy, and following more brokerage downgrades of global lenders. Australian stocks fell 0.5 percent as worries about the troubled credit markets continued to weigh and as Australia's central bank raised interest rates to a 12-year peak. Markets in China fell 1.9 percent by late trade, while Hong Kong, India and Singapore were down less than 1 percent. HOT METAL Spot platinum hit a record $2,243 an ounce, up from $2,230/$2,237 late in New York on Monday as the weakening dollar and supply problems in main producer South Africa triggered speculative buying. Spot palladium tracked the rally, jumping at one point to a 6-1/2-year high. Gold stayed within sight of Monday's record of $989.30 an ounce, trading in Asia at $981.90/$982.70. Oil held well above $102, but off a record of almost $104 reached in the previous session, supported by expectations that OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will leave output unchanged when it meets on Wednesday. The dollar steadied above record lows hit on Monday against the euro and a basket of currencies after euro zone officials expressed concerns about the sharp rise of the single currency. The dollar was steady against the Japanese yen trading at 103.
