 LONDON, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Online poker and casino software specialist Playtech reported on Tuesday a rise in profits for 2007, online gaming's first year without US gamblers, and revealed plans for a new wave of games. Playtech, which provides gambling Web sites with games ranging from poker and blackjack to roulette and mahjong, said annual underlying profit before tax was in line with analysts' expectations at $70 million, up from $68 million a year ago. The firm's chief executive Mor Weizer told Reuters he was "highly confident" about hitting analysts' forecasts for 2008 after a 12 percent quarter on quarter rise in revenues. He said Playtech would release three new Asian games by the end of the first quarter and more during the year, and revamp its poker software in time for the start of its second half. Despite the work on new games, Weizer said margins were expected to rise to around 70 percent over 2008 from around 67 percent at present. He said the firm expected to sign up more new licensees after landing six in the first quarter and announcing a deal to install its new Videobet software into 500 gaming machines in a Ukrainian casino. Based on a Reuters poll of 3 investment banks, analysts expect the firm to make $104 million of pretax profit in 2008 and more than $120 million in 2009. SPORT Former CEO Avigur Zmora said that although the firm would like to buy a sports betting software company, nothing that interested it was currently up for sale. With cash in the bank, Zmora said the firm would continue to look to buy up rivals that help it get into markets, improve its technology or boost its scale. Shares in the firm, which have risen almost 25 percent in the last month, were down almost 1 pecent by 1100 GMT. "The outlook statement in our view is in line with market expectation, and with material consensus upgrades at this stage unlikely, we think the shares will pause for breath," said Numis analyst Richard Carter. Like all online poker and casino firms, Playtech was hit hard when the US effectively outlawed Internet gambling by banning the related online bank transfers in October 2006. While operators like PartyGaming, 888 and Sportingbet have struggled to rebuild their businesses, Playtech has had a better time as operators have seen buying its software as a way of keeping their own costs to a minimum. Without massive U.S. profits and having to now focus on a myriad of markets with different languages and different betting preferences, it has become too expensive for all but the biggest operators to develop their own software. Adding in paper losses as a result of falling share prices in some of its Asian investments and stock options, Playtech's 2007 pretax profit fell to $42 million million for the year to end-Dec, from $60 in 20
