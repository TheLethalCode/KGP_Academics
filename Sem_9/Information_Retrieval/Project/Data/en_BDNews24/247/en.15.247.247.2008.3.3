<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Leaders of Gano Forum and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh said Sunday that they had no objection to holding local polls prior to the national elections. "The local elections can be seen as a test case for the national polls." Gano Forum acting general secretary Subrata Chowdhury told reporters following a meeting at the Gano Forum central office. "The local government elections are necessary to strengthen the base of democracy. However, the political parties should take a united decision on when the local polls are to be held," Subrata said. "We don't want to see elections for elections' sake, or government for government's sake," Bikalpadhara secretary general Abdul Mannan said. Mannan stressed that there should never be a repeat of the politicisation of power that proved to be such a feature of previous administrations. Leaders of the two parties said their meeting had decided to call for a national dialogue with the public in conjunction with the government's talks with political parties. Gano Forum presidium member Pankaj Bhattacharya said the association between the two parties was based on shared principles and values. "Alongside dialogue with the political parties the government should continue its national dialogue with the people. Representatives from the professions and civic society can take part," Pankaj said. The Gano Forum leader called for the caretaker administration to make the spiralling cost of essentials one of its highest priorities along with ensuring power and the means for irrigation to farmers. Bikalpadhara secretary general Abdul Mannan said if his party came to power a government would be formed on the basis of national unity. "What did we get in the last three elections? We are working for a sustainable democracy. This time we want free, fair and neutral elections." Bikalpadhara spokesman Mahi B Chowdhury said the bi-lateral meeting had decided to reject any alliance with war criminals, communal forces or black money holders. "We reflect the people's aspirations and the spirit of the Liberation War," he said. Eighteen leaders of Gano Forum and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh were present in the Monday's meeting bdnews
