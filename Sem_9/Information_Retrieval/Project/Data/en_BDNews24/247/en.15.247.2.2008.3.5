 MARCOUSSIS, France, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France have named three uncapped players in their starting line-up for Sunday's Six Nations game against Italy at the Stade de France. The newcomers are centre Yann David, 19, and prop Fabien Barcella and flanker Ibrahim Diarra, who are both 24. Coach Marc Lievremont also handed a first start to fullback Anthony Floch, who won his first cap as a late replacement in France's 24-13 defeat to England on Feb. 23. He recalled centre Yannick Jauzion who missed the first three games of the championship because of a hand injury. Only five players who started the game lost 24-13 to England on Feb. 23 will cross the white line of the Stade de France on Sunday. With two wins and a defeat, holders France are currently third on four points along with Ireland and England. Wales lead the way on six while Italy and Scotland are still to get off the mark. Team: 15-Anthony Floch, 14-Aurelien Rougerie, 13-Yannick Jauzion, 12-Yann David, 11-Julien Malzieu, 10-Francis Trinh-Duc, 9-Dimitri Yachvili, 8-Louis Picamoles, 7-Fulgence Ouedraogo, 6-Ibrahim Diarra, 5-Jerome Thion, 4-Lionel Nallet (captain), 3-Nicolas Mas, 2-Dimitri Szarzewski, 1-Fabien Barcella Replacements: 16-Guilhem Guirado, 17-Jean-Baptiste Poux, 18-Arnaud Mela, 19-Julien Bonnaire, 20-Julien Tomas, 21-Damien Traille, 22-Vincent Cler
