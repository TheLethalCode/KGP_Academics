 Hong Kong, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on Tuesday, recovering from the previous session's tumble as the dollar halted its precipitous slide, while gold and platinum hovered at or near record highs. Along with booming metals prices, oil prices are near an all time peak and agricultural commodities are also trading at record highs as supply shortages and investment flows pump up prices. The concerns that the US economy is at or entering a recession are creating a cycle: a plunging dollar sparks a rally in commodity prices, which in turn hit stocks further as a weakening global economy may now also have to deal with inflationary pressures. But some analysts said gains in commodities could not continue indefinitely. "The rally defies conventional thinking. Each time lousy (economic) numbers come out, prices go higher. Even when Warren Buffett said the United States is in recession, the market just went barreling ahead," MF Global analyst Edward Meir said. MSCI'S measure of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 0.4 percent as of 0200 GMT, rebounding after suffering its biggest percentage decline in six weeks on Monday. The index has dropped 11.4 percent this year as of the previous session amid fears about further losses in the global financial sector and the impact on the export-dependent region from a slowing US economy. Japan's Nikkei benchmark average rose 0.7 percent, rebounding from a six-week low earlier in the session, though financial shares such as Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group remained weak amid continued credit concerns. Credit- and subprime-related concerns are again scaring investors after U.S. mortgage lender Thornburg Mortgage Inc plunged on Monday amid worries it was facing bankruptcy, and following more brokerage downgrades of global lenders. Australian stocks were down nearly 1 percent, as a widely expected hike in domestic interest rates pressured financial firms. "We are still waiting for the fog to clear and work out who has got bad debts and what the exposure is," said Hans Kunnen, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State in Australia. Markets in South Korea and China were up less than 1 percent each, though Taiwan and Hong Kong gained more than 1 percent ech. SURGING METALS Spot platinum hit a record $2,243 an ounce, up from $2,230/2,237 late in New York on Monday as the weakening dollar and supply problems in main producer South Africa triggered speculative buying. Spot palladium tracked the rally as well, jumping at one point to a 6-1/2-year high. Gold stayed within sight of Monday's record of $989.30 an ounce, trading in Asia at $985.40/986/20. Oil prices remained steady as well, with US crude for April deliver up 6 cents at $102.52 a barrel on the Globex electronic trading platform, off a record $103.95 hit on Monday. The dollar steadied above record lows hit on Monday against the euro and a basket of currencies after euro zone officials expressed concerns about the sharp rise of the single European currency. "The dollar's downside is seen limited and the market will likely take a break this session from the heavy selling of the past few days as players cover short positions," one dealer said. The dollar was steady against the Japanese yen trading at 103.39
