 MANILA, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has lifted a ban on officials testifying in congressional inquiries, paving the way for more witnesses to appear in a graft probe that has rattled her administration. "Effective immediately, I am revoking executive order 464," Arroyo said in a statement sent to reporters on Wednesday via mobile phone text message. Arroyo, who has faced calls to resign over the Senate probe into alleged kickbacks, has been under pressure from powerful Catholic bishops, her own vice-president as well as business and civil society groups to allow her officials to testify. Analysts say the former economist, who has already survived three impeachment attempts and at least three coup bids, is likely to see out the remainder of her term. They say she has the support of the military and the Church, which can rally large numbers, has not united behind calls for her to resign. Arroyo's final term ends in mid-2010. Senators said Arroyo's decision, made after she met a group of bishops, was just a "publicity stunt" to please the Church and witnesses could still side-step questions by arguing that their conversations with Arroyo were confidential. "The impression people get is that with 464 repealed, everything is okay," Senator Manuel Villar told reporters. "They can still resort to all other means to thwart our efforts to find out the truth in these anomalous deals." Opposition groups, some bishops and students have been calling for Arroyo to resign over the scandal into an alleged $130 million worth of kickbacks in a $329 million government telecoms deal with China's ZTE. Her opponents say Arroyo is covering up for officials and her husband, who has been linked to the controversy. Both Arroyo and her husband have denied any wrongdoing. Last week, tens of thousands of people gathered in Manila's financial district calling for Arroyo to step down, the biggest crowd since about 40,000 protested against her in 2005 amid allegations she cheated in the 2004 election. Many Filipinos, however, are sick of political turmoil and the numbers at last week's rally were a fraction of the 500,000 who took to the streets to oust former president Joseph Estrada in 2001 and the 1 million who faced down tanks to overthrow dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 19
