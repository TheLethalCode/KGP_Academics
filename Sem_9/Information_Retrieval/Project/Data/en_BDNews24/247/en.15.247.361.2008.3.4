 LAHORE, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least five people were killed on Tuesday in a suspected suicide truck bomb attack on a Pakistan naval college in the eastern city of Lahore, officials said. There were several other blasts heard in the vicinity, but it was not immediately clear if they were separate explosions or linked to the initial attack. "I saw a fully charred body," a Reuters photographer at the scene said. "A black cloud of smoke was rising from the scene as I reached there." Pakistan is reeling from a bombing campaign waged by Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban. Over 500 people have been killed in related violence since the start of the year. Tackling the violence will provide a tough test for the incoming government following elections two weeks ago which saw no clear winner emerge, sparking coalition talks between various parties mostly hostile to President Pervez Musharraf. A navy spokesman told Reuters that a suicide bomber, possibly two of them, had driven a truck to the entrance of the Pakistan Navy War College in the historic city of Lahore, about 290 kms (180 miles) southeast of the capital, Islamabad. He said the bombers and one navy staffer had died, but police put the toll at 5 dead. Television pictures showed a damaged truck near the bent and buckled gates of the college. Emergency vehicles were seen rushing in and out of the premises. POLITICAL NERVE CENTRE The blast in the country's political nerve centre coincided with a visit by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen to the capital, where he held talks with Pakistan's military leadership and President Pervez Musharraf. Mullen's visit aimed at reinforcing the military-to-military relationship with Pakistan, according to embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Colton. Mullen last visited Pakistan a month ago, just before the election that resulted in defeat for U.S. ally Musharraf's political allies and returned a parliament that could try to drive the president from power. The United States has cultivated strong ties with the Pakistani military to safeguard its interests. "Pakistan has been indispensable to our worldwide struggle against radical terrorist groups. As Afghanistan's neighbour, Pakistan plays a pivotal role in the coalition's war effort there." US deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte told a senate committee last week. The West shudders at the thought of nuclear-armed Pakistan sliding into chaos. Sections of the Western media have depicted Pakistan as the most dangerous country in the world. Many Pakistanis believe there is some grand conspiracy to take away Pakistan's nuclear weapons, but realisation of the scale of the internal threat is dawning. Close aides of Musharraf say privately that al Qaeda's long-term goal is to destabilise Pakistan and Afghanistan in order to turn them into homez for global jihad
