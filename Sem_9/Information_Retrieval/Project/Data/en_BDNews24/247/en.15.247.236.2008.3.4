 HAMILTON, New Zealand, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England wicketkeeper Phil Mustard will undergo minor facial surgery after being struck during batting practice before the first test against New Zealand. Mustard broke his nose in the nets adjacent to Seddon Park when a shot from batsman Kevin Pietersen ricocheted off a support pole and hit him in the face. He was taken to Waikato hospital with blood streaming from his face and will have surgery on Wednesday. He was not in contention for the match and Tim Ambrose will be behind the stumps. England captain Michael Vaughan also received treatment after wrenching his neck while batting, though he said he would be fit to lead the tourists. England pace bowler Ryan Sidebottom, who had a hamstring muscle injury last week and was in doubt for the match, declared himself fit for selection after undergoing some tests and was confirmed in the team by Vaughan. Earlier, New Zealand called in medium fast bowler Mark Gillespie to replace Wellington team mate Iain O'Brien, who injured a toe while bowling during practice on Monday. Gillespie, however, may not be required to occupy the third seamer role behind Kyle Mills and Chris Martin because New Zealand are considering including two spinners in their side
