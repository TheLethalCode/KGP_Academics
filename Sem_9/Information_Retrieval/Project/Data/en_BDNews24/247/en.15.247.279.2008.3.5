 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  The polls to elect four directors of the Dhaka Stock Exchange will be held on May 11, DSE officials said. The election was originally scheduled for March 9, but was postponed due to withdrawal of nominations by all the nine candidates. The new date was announced at a DSE election board meeting Tuesday, the DSE's chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed said. "The submission of nomination papers will begin Wednesday and continue until April 10. Nominations may be withdrawn up to April 22," Salahuddin told bdnews24.com. Earlier in the week, a DSE board meeting held Sunday deferred its 46th Annual General Meeting to May 15. As per the DSE constitution the annual election must be held before the AGM, which had been scheduled to be held on March 13. The Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms authorised the deferral of the AGM on Feb 28, asking the DSE to hold the meeting by June 15 at the latest. The DSE board holds a total of 12 elected and 12 nominated directors. Four elected directors retire each year to be replaced through direct election. They are elected for a three-year term, according to the DSE constitution. Three candidates withdrew from the race on Feb 24, the last date for withdrawal of candidature, while six pulled out earlier, on Feb 20. bdn
