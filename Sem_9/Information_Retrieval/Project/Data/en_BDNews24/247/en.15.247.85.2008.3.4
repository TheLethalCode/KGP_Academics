 Jakarta, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's next central bank governor will take charge of an institution reeling from graft allegations, making the day-to-day job of running monetary policy at a time of rising inflation even tougher. Outgoing Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah and two colleagues are suspects in a corruption inquiry concerning a foundation linked to the central bank that made illegal payments to members of parliament. That may explain why neither Agus Martowardojo nor Raden Pardede -- the candidates nominated by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to replace him -- is a central banker by background. Yudhoyono was elected in 2004 with a promise to fight corruption, although critics say little progress has been made. Regarding the central bank, he "decided to inject fresh blood from outside", said Fauzi Ichsan, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank. What's important, analysts say, is to have a governor who is able to establish the integrity of the central bank and withstand political pressure ahead of elections in 2009, when politicians may be pushing the central bank for pump-priming measures, looser monetary policy or even -- as recent allegations suggest -- cash. Abdullah's term ends in May. He denies any wrongdoing. Some supporters say the investigation was timed to stop him standing for a second term. Parliament is expected to decide by the end of March who will be the new boss. "The issue is whether he will have the guts to say no to parliament, say no to the president," said Todung Mulya Lubis, chairman of Transparency International Indonesia, which monitors corruption and governance. Southeast Asia's biggest economy grew 6.3 percent last year, the best rate in a decade. But it needs to grow faster and attract foreign investment to create jobs for millions of unemployed Indonesians, without fuelling inflation. Indonesia's benchmark interest rate has fallen from 12.75 percent in late 2005 to 8.0 percent, but some economists say the central bank has eased too much, given a surge in the price of fuel and staples such as cooking oil, soybeans and rice. The new governor needs to show he is squeaky clean, said Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, an economist at Danareksa Research Institute. "At the same time he also has to be capable." TURNING ROUND BANKS Martowardojo, a 52-year-old banker, is seen as the favourite, although he is also rumoured to be a contender to run state oil firm Pertamina, which is being readied for privatisation. He has already shown he can turn round a troubled bank. In 2005 he took over as head of PT Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's biggest bank, replacing Edward Neloe, sentenced by the Supreme Court to 10 years in jail for corruption. He has slashed non-performing loans from 15 percent in 2005 to less than 5 percent. Before that, he headed Bank Permata and worked at Bank of America's Jakarta office for three years. "His ability to reform institutions is already evident as head of Bank Mandiri and previously Bank Permata," said Martono Soeprapto, managing director at the Indonesian Bankers Association, who worked with Martowardojo for several years. One close colleague said Amsterdam-born Martowardojo, who studied economics at the University of Indonesia, would have the background to deal with foreign central bankers, thanks to his experience in handling Mandiri's overseas operations. GAME THEORY Where economist Raden Pardede may have the edge, bankers say, is on the finer points of monetary policy. Pardede, 48, is vice president of state asset management company PPA, which has a brief to manage and sell troubled banking assets left over from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. "He has sharp intuition as regards macroeconomic conditions," said Renny Rorong, a senior PPA official. "When we sell assets such as banks, timing is very critical." Pardede heads the Forum for Financial Market Stability, an influential committee that advises the finance minister and whose members include central bank and finance ministry officials. In the course of his career, he has worked as a consultant for the World Bank and as chief economist at brokerage Danareksa. He is also a singer, and has related how he won a scholarship to Europe to study classical music but opted in the end to do an economics PhD at Boston University, studying game theory and industrial organisation. Monetary policy aside, perhaps the first task for the new governor will be to lift morale. In the enormous Bank Indonesia complex, with its miles of wood-panelled corridors and cavernous meeting rooms, some staff have taken to wearing black armbands as a sign of support for the outgoing governor. Indonesia's central bank has been the subject of various investigations in the past decade, particularly over its controversial role in lending billions of dollars in emergency funds to banks at the height of the crisis.
