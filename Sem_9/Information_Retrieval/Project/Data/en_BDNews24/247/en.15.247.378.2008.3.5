 LONDON, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index ticked up on Wednesday, snapping a five-day losing run, as gains in potential bid target Liberty International and in insurers outweighed the drag of companies going ex-dividend. By 0928 GMT, the benchmark FTSE was up 5.8 points, or 0.1 percent at 5,773.5, after having fallen by about 5 percent in the previous five trading days. The UK benchmark index has shed 10 percent so far this year on fears of a US recession and further credit-related writedowns by financial institutions. "In general there are better performances coming through being helped by the fact that we did see a recovery in Wall Street yesterday and hopes for the monoline insurers' position is looking slightly better," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.

Liberty International jumped 6.5 percent after the Independent newspaper said the property firm was in talks with a major rival to form the world's largest shopping mall group.

Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier advanced 1.9 percent. The Times said private equity group Permira had emerged as a potential suitor for Reed Business Information, the trade magazines arm of Reed Elsevier, which could soon be for sale for about 1.25 billion pounds. British broadcaster ITV added 0.9 percent after it said net advertising revenues for its family of channels was expected to be up almost 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008, as it reported 2007 results broadly in line with expectations. Hedge fund group Man Group added 2.4 percent after it said the net asset value of its main AHL funds rose 5.9 percent last week.
