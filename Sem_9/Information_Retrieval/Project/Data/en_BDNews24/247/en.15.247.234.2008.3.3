 JAKARTA, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's anti-graft agency has named a government prosecutor as a suspect in a bribery case after he was caught leaving a house with $660,000 in cash, an agency spokesman said on Monday.

KPK, a special government body that was set up to investigate top government officials and business executives for graft, has legal powers to make an arrest, take over investigations and fast-track sensitive cases.
