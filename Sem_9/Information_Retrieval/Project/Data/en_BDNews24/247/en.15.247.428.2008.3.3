 Moscow/Kiev, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian gas monopoly Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine by at least a quarter on Monday over what it said were unpaid debts, just hours after the company chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, won Russia's presidential election. Gazprom pledged its exports to Europe would not be affected A quarter of Europe's gas supplies pass through Ukraine. Gazprom has threatened to cut gas supplies during previous pricing disputes with former Soviet neighbours Ukraine and Belarus, but this is only the second time it has acted on the threat after a landmark cut in the New Year of 2006. That brief disruption reduced supplies to Gazprom's west European customers, making them wary of any hint of a new row. The new reduction comes as Europe's heating season is nearing its end, unlike in 2006 when it came in the middle of winter. "Gazprom is a reliable gas supplier, but we cannot and won't supply gas without payment," said Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov. He said deliveries had been reduced by 40 million cubic metres a day. Ukraine's state energy firm, Naftogaz, confirmed supplies had been reduced. It gave a figure of 46 million cubic metres a day, revised from an earlier report of 38 mcm, as it said Gazprom had slashed the supplies by a further 10 percent later on the day. "Naftogaz has just received another notice from Gazprom saying gas flows have been cut by a further 10 percent. This amounts to reductions of 46 million cubic metres per day," Naftogaz spokesman Valentyn Zemlyansky told reporters. By comparison, Gazprom supplies Europe with around 410 mcm a day and Ukraine gets 135 mcm a day. Zemlyansky said the volumes were insignificant for Ukraine and would not have an impact on its consumers. Gazprom declined to comment on any additional reduction. Gazprom shares were down 1.36 percent at 1400 GMT, deeper than the the broader marker, which were down 0.93 percent, and in line with MICEX oil and gas index. EUROPE NOT TO BE AFFECTED The European Commission said Gazprom had told it that flows to the European Union would not be harmed. "Gazprom have assured the Commission gas supplies to the European Union won't be affected," the EU executive body's spokesman told a regular briefing. Poland's dominant gas group PGNiG said it had not noted any fall in pressure in its natural gas pipeline carrying Russian gas via Ukraine. It said it did not expect the dispute to last longer than a week or two and if a supply disruption did occur, it had stored gas to last it through the end of March. Medvedev, 42, who is Gazprom's chairman and First Deputy Prime Minister, won over 70 percent of the vote in the presidential election on Sunday and will be the youngest Russian leader since Tsar Nicholas II when he is sworn in on May 7. He has asked the current president, Vladimir Putin, to be his prime minister. Putin, 55, was prevented by term limits from running for re-election. For a story on the election, click on. Putin has had difficult relations with Ukraine's pro-Western leadership, which is thinking of joining the NATO alliance. Valery Nesterov from Troika Dialog brokerage said he saw little reason why Medvedev's relations with Kiev should be different. "Clearly, the Russia-Ukraine gas relationship, which was already on the rocks, began to deteriorate sharply last month." "The unresolved problems are piling up and include Ukrainian debts to Gazprom, gas prices, the marketing scheme for gas..., re-exports of Russian gas and more importantly the broader geopolitical disagreements between the two countries," he said. Gazprom says it has failed to reach a compromise with Ukraine over a $600 million debt for previous supplies and is also concerned by the lack of any deal for deliveries in 2008. Ukrainian officials say the debt had been paid in full. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Putin agreed last month to settle the debt and eliminate intermediaries in gas trade. But a subsequent visit to Moscow by Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is viewed less favourably by the Kremlin, brought new tensions. Kupriyanov said Gazprom was ready to continue talks but did not say whether either side would visit the other soon. Nesterov said he doubted any new deal would last long. "Any gas agreements that the countries make periodically is no more than a short-term fix that is bound to fail until the development of a broader relationship encompassing gas policy as well as wider issues," the analyst said.
