 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka special judge's court Monday set Mar 9 for charge framing in a graft case against Sheikh Hasina and seven others involving the setting up of three barge-mounted power stations. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 set the date after Hasina's lawyers moved for more time. Hasina was taken to the special courtroom on the Sangsad Bhaban premises at 9:45 am. As the judge arrived in court minutes later, Hasina's defence submitted that they had not had sufficient time to look into all the legal files and documents related to the case and therefore sought more time to do so. Earlier, on Feb 26, a Dhaka court had denied bail to the former prime minister in the graft case. Judge Md Firoz Alam had then adjourned proceedings of the case until March 3. The Anticorrupion Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon police against eight people including Sheikh Hasina. The case claims that the accused took bribes amounting to Tk 3 crore in exchange for awarding contracts for the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnews
