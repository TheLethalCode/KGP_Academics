 BAKU, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Azerbaijan accused neighbour Armenia on Wednesday of stoking unrest in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, following shooting there in which Azerbaijan said 16 soldiers had been killed. The Azeri Defence Ministry said 12 Armenian forces and four Azeri soldiers were killed in clashes in the disputed enclave, seized by pro-Armenian forces from Azerbaijan in a war in the 1990s in which an estimated 35,000 people died. The Azeri defence ministry said the clashes had lasted for 13 hours on Tuesday, killing three Azeri soldiers. The fourth serviceman died in a new shootout on Wednesday. Armenia has blamed the Azeri for Tuesday's incident but has given no clear casualty figures. A death toll of 16 would mark the worst clash in recent years between Muslim Azerbaijan and Christian Armenia, who are still technically at war with each other. "The Armenian side resorted to provocations on the frontline in a bid to switch the attention of the international community and its own citizens from internal tensions to an external enemy," said Khazar Ibrahim, an Azeri Foreign Ministry spokesman. "Azerbaijan will never resort to provocations, but will give a proper response to them." Armenian President Robert Kocharyan imposed a state of emergency last weekend following mass protests against last month's presidential election, which the opposition says was rigged. Azerbaijan's president said on Tuesday his country was ready to take back Nagorno-Karabakh by force if need be and was buying military equipment and arms in preparation. President Ilham Aliyev linked his comments to the newly-declared independence in Kosovo which he said had emboldened Armenian separatists in the mountainous enclave. On Tuesday Armenia's Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan confirmed there had been an incident between Azeri and Armenian soldiers but he did not give a casualty figure. "The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will be solved by peaceful means and I rule out a military solution to this conflict," he said. SPORADIC CLASHES Azerbaijan is a major oil producer and home to important gas and oil pipelines carrying energy from the Caspian Sea to world markets, which pass close to the border with Armenia. Robert Simmons, NATO's special representative for the Caucasus and Central Asia, said the alliance was ready to help facilitate the peace process. "I think there is a chance for settlement and we will work for it," he was quoted as saying on a visit to Moscow by Russian news agencies. "We are closely watching the peace process." Nagorno-Karabakh, mainly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan in the late 1980s, sparking a 1992-94 war between Armenian-backed separatists and the Azeri army. Over 35,000 people were killed in the war and over one million people were displaced. A ceasefire was agreed in 1994 but the territory remains under Armenian control, there are sporadic clashes along the front line and the search for a lasting peace is stalled. But a western diplomat based in Armenia said the latest reports of a gun fight between Armenian and Azeri soldiers had to be treated more seriously. "This does sound in the terms it's been reported as slightly more than the usual skirmish, but in the current climate it certainly could have been exaggerated," he said. "This is a situation we have to watch carefull
