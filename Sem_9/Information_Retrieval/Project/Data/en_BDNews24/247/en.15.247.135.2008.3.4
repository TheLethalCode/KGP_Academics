<TITLE> West drops IAEA governors move on Iran after row </TITLE>

 Vienna, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European powers on Tuesday dropped a bid to have UN nuclear watchdog governors heap pressure on Iran over dubious atomic work after objections by Russia, China and developing nations, Western diplomats said. Opponents felt a resolution against Iran would be superfluous a day after the U.N. Security Council toughened sanctions on Iran and could provoke a resentful Tehran to cut, not increase, cooperation with U.N. inspectors, they said. "The board doesn't need to compete with the Security Council," an Asian diplomat in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) told Reuters. Britain, France and Germany scrapped the resolution after concluding their goals had been achieved by the Security Council and there was no point risking a schism among U.N. nuclear policymakers Iran might exploit, Western diplomats added. "Iran thought it could manipulate the IAEA to avoid a Security Council resolution while moving forward to develop its uranium enrichment capability," Gregory Schulte, U.S. ambassador to the Vienna-based IAEA, told reporters. "As the resolution adopted yesterday in New York shows, Iran clearly failed. In fact what the resolution does from a Vienna perspective is to underscore that Iran's file remains open and to fully support the IAEA in its continuing investigation of outstanding issues, particularly with respect to weaponisation." Iran has pursued a uranium-enrichment programme it says is meant only to generate electricity. But its history of nuclear secrecy and continued curbs on IAEA inspections stoke fears it could turn enrichment technology to yielding nuclear arms. In imposing more far-reaching sanctions by a 14-0 vote, the Security Council cited Iran's defiance of demands to suspend enrichment, failure to fully explain past nuclear activity and continued restrictions on IAEA inspections. Last week the IAEA's chief inspector presented to the IAEA board detailed intelligence suggesting Iran has tried to "weaponise" nuclear materials. He revealed diagrams, slides and video, much of them from a laptop spirited out of Iran by a defector, indicating administrative links between projects to process uranium, test high explosives and modify a missile cone for a nuclear payload. IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei, in a speech opening the weeklong governors session on Monday, prodded Iran to cooperate with a mounting investigation into the allegations, signalling it would not take Tehran's flat denials for a final answer. With a board resolution out of the picture, statements in board debate on Iran will come individually from the United States, EU and other Western allies, and the developing nation bloc -- NAM. Iran is a member of NAM but not of the IAEA board.
