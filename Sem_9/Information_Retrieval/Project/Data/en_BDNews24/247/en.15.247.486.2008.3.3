 Dhaka, March 02 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Sunday the main election office would wrap up initial voter registration work by the end of June. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sunday organised a programme at Radisson Water Garden Hotel to evaluate progress in voter registration. Speaking at the programme, the CEC said the commission registered 40 million voters by Feb 27. The EC with the help of Bangladesh army for the first time started the project on a pilot basis in Sreepur Paursashava under Gazipur district on June 10, 2007. "It's a historic achievement. We are proud to be part of the history," said army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, who also attended the programme. Renata Dessallien, UNDP resident representative and UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, said: "You will have a lot of countries knocking at your door for advice on how to prepare a gold standard voter list." The UNDP mobilised $50 million (about Tk 345 crore) from development partners like the European Commission, DFID, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and South Korea to complete the photo-attached voters roll. Former US ambassador to Bangladesh Patricia Butenis, US embassy Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi, Gano Forum chief Dr Kamal Hossain and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami were also present. bdnews
