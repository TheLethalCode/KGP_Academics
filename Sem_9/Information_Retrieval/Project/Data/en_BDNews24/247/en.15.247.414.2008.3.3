<TITLE> Anne Heche subs for actress in comedy feature </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK (Reuters/Hollywood Reporter/bdnews24.com) - Anne Heche is set to star opposite Ashton Kutcher in the indie romantic comedy "Spread," replacing Jennifer Jason Leigh. The "Punk'd" star and "Call Me Crazy" author will mix it up in the tale of a womanizer and the lover he scorns. Leigh dropped out of the project February 21 for undisclosed reasons. News reports have suggested that Leigh and her husband, "Margot at the Wedding" director Noah Baumbach, are expecting a child. Heche has had a career resurgence on ABC's "Men in Trees." The series returned to the air Wednesday with 11 episodes in the can, giving Heche free time before the show likely resumes shooting in the summer. With only a minor hiccup in the recasting, the Los Angeles-based production is set to begin this week. David Mackenzie directs. Heche's feature credits include the "Psycho" remake, and "Six Days Seven Nights" with Harrison Ford.
