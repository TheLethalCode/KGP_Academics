 LONDON, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The London Assembly vowed on Wednesday to continue its investigation into accusations of the misuse of public funds following the resignation of a close aide of Mayor Ken Livingstone. Lee Jasper, the mayor's race adviser, quit on Tuesday after the London Evening Standard published allegations surrounding intimate e-mails between himself and a woman involved with organisations which he had recommended receive more than 100,000 pounds of grants. He said in his resignation letter that he wanted to put a stop to a "relentless" media campaign.

She represents The 1990 Trust, which promotes the interests of Britain's black communities and a director of the Black Londoners' Forum. A GLA spokesman said Jasper had played a leading role in the authority's campaign against racism and black gun crime. "No evidence has been presented for the criminal allegations presented by the Evening Standard," the spokesman said. "However Lee Jasper has stated that in light of material published today that he has tendered his resignation. "The mayor has accepted it." Boris Johnson said the resignation was further proof that Livingstone "has had his day". "Londoners deserve to know where their hard-earned cash has gone," he sa
