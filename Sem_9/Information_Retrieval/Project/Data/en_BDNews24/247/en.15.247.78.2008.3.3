<TITLE> Low turnout for Thai Senate elections </TITLE>

 Bangkok, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Little-known candidates and voter weariness caused a low turnout in weekend elections for Thailand's Senate, the first poll for an upper house since a September 2006 coup, officials and analysts said on Monday. About 56 percent of eligible voters turned out for Sunday's race to pick a senator for each of the country's 76 provinces. That compared to nearly 75 percent turnout in December's general election run under a new post-coup constitution. "We won't complain about the turnout because there have been several national and local elections," Election Commissioner Prapan Naikowit told reporters. As well as the normal slew of local and provincial polls, in the last two years Thailand has had three general elections, a constitutional referendum and another vote for a Senate that never even met before the coup rendered it obsolete. Under the 2007 army-designed constitution to replace the 1997 "People's Constitution", the new Senate consists of 76 elected members and 74 appointed by top civil servants. It can pass laws, appoint independent watchdog bodies, debate government performance and recall cabinet ministers, top legislators and judges accused of corruption. Thai media said the senators, who are meant to be without party affiliation, were a mix of pro and anti-Thaksin candidates
