 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court will deliver its verdict in a graft case against former Awami League whip SM Mostafa Rashidi Suja and wife Khodeza Rashidi on March 12. Judge Khandaker Kamal Uzzaman of Special Judge's Court-9 set the date Tuesday after arguments from the prosecution. Both Suja and his wife remain on the run. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Md Moniruzzaman filed the case on July 10 last year with Ramna Police Station against the AL leader, his wife and their two daughters Sanzida Rashidi Shimmi and Taniza Rashidi Turki. According to case details, Suja amassed Tk 4.43 crore illegally and concealed wealth to the tune of Tk 78.85 lakh in his wealth statement to the ACC. Suja's wife and daughters assisted him in accumulating the wealth, the case alleged. But the names of Suja's daughters were taken off the chargesheet Over 40 witnesses testified on behalf of the state. On Feb 18 last year, the ACC made a list of 50 corruption suspects, which included politicians and government officials.
