 Basra, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British military said on Monday it was investigating whether a woman had been killed and three children wounded by a defective artillery shell it had fired in defence of its base in the Iraqi city of Basra. Iraqi police and a hospital source said one other child had been killed in the incident, which came three days after a British airman was killed in a rocket attack on the Basra base. The British military made no reference to a second death. The event took place after British forces, based on the outskirts of Basra, 550 km (340 miles) southeast of Baghdad, came under rocket attack late on Sunday and fired three "illumination rounds" in response, said a spokesman for British forces, Major Tom Holloway. "It is with regret and remorse that British forces learned of the death of a woman and the injuries to three children," Holloway said. "There is an investigation ongoing to determine whether this is a result of an illumination round fired yesterday evening." An illumination round is an artillery shell that is supposed to split in mid-air releasing a flare. Holloway said British forces were looking at whether one of the shells fired had failed to detonate properly. A hospital source said they had received the body of a woman and a child, and three other wounded. "Two people were killed, a woman and a child, and four other children were wounded," said a police colonel from the city, speaking on condition of anonymity. Britain handed over responsibility for security in Basra province to Iraqi forces in December but maintains a base at the city's airport housing about 4,500 troops which has continued to face sporadic rocket and mortar attacks. On Friday, Sergeant Duane Barwood was killed when the base was hit by a rocket. He was the 175th British serviceman to be killed in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. In January, British forces responded with artillery after militants fired a barrage of rockets at the base, killing one Iraqi and wounding five others.
