 LYON, France, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Lyon believe they are closing the gap but still have a lot of work to do if they are to compete on equal terms with the upper crust of European football. The six-times French champions, playing in the Champions League last 16 for the fifth year in a row, were knocked out on Tuesday by Manchester United 2-1 on aggregate. "We now have one thing to think about: qualifying for the next Champions League and showing again the gap with the top clubs has narrowed, because in Manchester, we showed we were not that far," club president Jean-Michel Aulas told reporters after Tuesday's 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford. France winger Sidney Govou added: "We fell to a great team, with great names. Yes, we are disappointed because the gap is not that big between the two teams but it is a very difficult one to narrow and, in a way, we are still far behind." In 2004, 2005 and 2006, Lyon reached the quarter-finals, losing to eventual winners Porto, PSV Eindhoven and AC Milan. Last year, they were eliminated by AS Roma in the first knockout round. At Old Trafford, Lyon failed really to trouble the English champions, with France striker Karim Benzema, hailed as one of the best players of his generation, unable to break the deadlock. The 20-year-old Benzema, who struck his team's opener in a 1-1 first leg draw, still lacks the killer instinct that helped Cristiano Ronaldo score the winner three minutes from the interval on Tuesday. Lyon now have to set their sights on more moderate goals, a record seventh consecutive French title and a first French Cup since 1973. They play second-placed Girondins Bordeaux at home on Sunday in Ligue 1 and Sochaux later this month in a French Cup last 16 tie
