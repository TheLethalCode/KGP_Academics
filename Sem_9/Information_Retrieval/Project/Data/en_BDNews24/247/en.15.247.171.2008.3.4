 Nairobi, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The involvement of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete in sealing a deal to end Kenya's crisis has raised hopes he can push forward east African integration. Here are some key facts about him: Kikwete, 57, rose through the ranks of the Tanzanian military and ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, taking high positions in the 1980s before becoming foreign minister in 1995. He suffered a narrow defeat by Benjamin Mkapa the same year in the contest for the CCM nomination for president. But he became the candidate in 2005 and won the presidential ballot with more than 80 percent of votes. Trained as an economist and raised as an admirer of Tanzania's socialist founding father Julius Nyerere, Kikwete has become a proponent of free-market economics. Last month, he was elected chairman of the African Union at a heads of state summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He is popular among the youth, for whom he has promised to create jobs. He is also popular with Western governments for an anti-graft campaign that has claimed senior CCM leaders. Kikwete decsribes himself as a moderate Muslim, but received some education from a Catholic missionary school. To supporters, the youthful looking Kikwete is affable and smooth talking, but critics accuse him of haughtiness.
