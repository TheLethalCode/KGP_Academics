<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British broadcaster ITV posted a 17 percent fall in 2007 earnings due to digital investment and a row over premium-rate phone-ins but said advertising revenues showed signs of improvement in early 2008. Its shares opened up 2.6 percent at 68.2 pence. ITV said net advertising revenues (NAR) for its family of channels was expected to be up almost 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008, in a total TV market down 0.7 percent. The company, home to the "Coronation Street" soap opera and "The X Factor" talent show, said NAR for 2007 had held steady at 1.49 billion pounds ($2.96 billion), with growth on the digital channels offsetting a 4 percent NAR drop on the main ITV1 channel.

Underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) for the year were 311 million pounds, down from 375 million pounds, also hit by the fall in premium-rate services and investment in digital channels. Analysts had been expecting revenue of 2.09 billion pounds and underlying EBITA of 306 million pounds according to data from Reuters Estimates.
