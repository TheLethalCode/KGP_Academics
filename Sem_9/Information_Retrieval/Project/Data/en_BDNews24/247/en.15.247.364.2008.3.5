 HAMILTON, New Zealand, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England seamer James Anderson has been released to play for New Zealand side Auckland in their domestic four-day match against Wellington. Anderson was not picked for the first test against New Zealand in Hamilton and will join Auckland for their match on Eden Park's outer oval, beginning on Thursday. Auckland's pace bowling stocks have been hit with Kyle Mills and Chris Martin on test duty, while Andre Adams and Daryl Tuffey have gone to India to play in the rebel Indian Cricket League. "It's an opportunity that seems too good to pass up," Auckland chief executive Andrew Eade said in a statement on New Zealand Cricket's Web site (http://www.blackcaps.co.nz). "Auckland normally has the policy of developing young local talent without going outside our boundaries but we have lost four senior fast bowlers this season. "Consequently we see a real benefit in the short term for the youngsters we do have in the side to learn from a player of true international standard." England coach Peter Moores also welcomed the move. He's played a lot of one-day cricket but didn't play in the three-day game last week," Moores told reporters at the first test in Hamilton. "So it's a great chance for him to go away and get some more experience of playing in New Zealand. "Jimmy was very keen to go and play and that's how it came about because of his enthusiasm to get a game under his belt and get a bowl." Anderson will link up with the England team again before the second test begins in Wellington on March 13
