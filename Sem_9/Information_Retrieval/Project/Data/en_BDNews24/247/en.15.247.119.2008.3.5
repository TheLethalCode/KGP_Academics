 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission is likely to interrogate former prime minister Khaleda Zia in the Niko corruption case at the special jail Thursday, a prisons official said. "Khaleda Zia is likely to be interrogated in the Niko corruption case tomorrow," deputy inspector general (DIG) of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Wednesday. In another development, a Dhaka court permitted Masud Ahmed Taluker, a counsel for the accused, to visit Khaleda in special jail. The ACC on Dec 9 last year filed separate cases against 12 people, including former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina on charges of handing over three gasfields to foreign company Niko Resources showing them as abandoned. ACC assistant director Mahbubul Alam filed the case against Khaleda. Other accused in the case are former law minister barrister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister for power and energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting secretary of the ministry Khandaker Shahidul Islam and Niko Resources vice-president for South Asia Kashem Sharif. Later on the basis of the appeal by the investigation officer of the case, businessman Gias Uddin Al Mamun and former president of Dhaka Club Selim Bhuiyan were also made accused. The two were not mentioned in the FIR. The allegations of causing Tk 10,000 crore loss to the government by leasing out the three gasfields to the Canadian oil-gas exploration and extraction firm were brought against the accused. Khaleda, Moudud and Mosharraf Hossain were shown arrested in the case on Dec 30 last year while Selim Bhuiyan was shown arrested on Jan 10 and Mamun on Feb 6. Khaleda was arrested at her Dhaka cantonment home on Sept 3 last year. bdnew
