The relationships also benefited when the discussions moved beyond "safe" or impersonal subjects such as puberty, reproduction and sexually transmitted diseases to more private topics such as masturbation and how sex feels. The surveys looked at children's attitudes toward their parents over a one-year period and asked about how many of 22 sexual topics were discussed. Mothers tended to discuss twice as many sexual topics with their children -- 12 -- as fathers did, the study said.
