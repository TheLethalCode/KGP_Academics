 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Monday sentenced former Awami League chief whip Abul Hasanat Abdullah to a total of 13 years in jail for amassing wealth by illegal means. Judge AKM Arifur Rahman of Special Judge's Court-10, set up on the premises of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, handed down the verdict in the absence of the accused. Sheikh Hasina's cousin, Hasanat was also fined Tk 20 lakh or two more years in jail on failure to pay. The sentence will be effective from the date of Hasanat's surrender or arrest since he remains fugitive, the court said. The judge also ordered confiscation of Hasanat's illegally acquired assets. The AL leader will have to spend 13 years behind bars as a total of two sentences of ten and three years served consecutively. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 6 following Hasanat's submission of a wealth statement to the commission. According to the case filed with Dhanmondi police, Hasanat concealed information in his statement in which he claimed to own property worth Tk 52.55 lakh. Prosecutors in the case however said Hasanat had illegally acquired wealth amounting to over Tk 1 crore. In a separate case, a Dhaka court sentenced Hasanat on Dec 12 to nine years' imprisonment on tax dodging charges. Hasnat was named as one of the top graft suspects in a list published by the ACC on Feb 18, 2007. bdnews24.co
