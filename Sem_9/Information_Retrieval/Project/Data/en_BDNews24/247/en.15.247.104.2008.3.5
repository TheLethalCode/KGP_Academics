 BARCELONA, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gloom has descended on Barcelona, despite having cruised through to the last eight of the Champions League, with a new injury setback to live-wire forward Lionel Messi. The 20-year-old left the pitch in tears late in the first half of his side's 1-0 win over Celtic on Tuesday with a thigh muscle tear in his left leg, the fourth time the Argentine has suffered this type of injury in the last three seasons. The fact that Messi's game relies so much on his explosive acceleration has heightened concerns about the latest injury. He was out for five weeks earlier this season with a similar problem in the same leg. "It is a very sad moment for the player," said Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. "The injury is a big blow to all of us and I just hope it isn't as bad as it seems." Rijkaard had come under fire from the local media for leaving Messi out of the starting line-up during Saturday's 4-2 defeat at Atletico Madrid and Barca captain Carles Puyol said they were partly to blame for the injury. "Messi's injury is a lesson to everyone," he told reporters. "You pressured for him to play against Celtic and now look what has happened. What you have to do is show more respect for the medical staff and the coach. "Rijkaard took the decision to rest Leo (against Atletico) at the Calderon because there was a risk of injury. Now I suppose you will be criticising the medical staff because he is injured." Midfielder Xavi, who scored the goal that completed Barca's 4-2 aggregate win over the Scots, said the loss of Messi was a serious blow to the club's prospects in both the league and Europe. "We paid a very high price for this victory," he said. "Leo was in fantastic form. It is a real shame." Tuesday's win over Celtic meant that Barcelona will join Fenerbahce, Arsenal and Manchester United in the last eight. Two other English sides Liverpool and Chelsea also have a chance of going through. Fullback Silvinho said the English Premier League sides posed the greatest threat to Barca in the quarter-finals. "English are now the big force in Europe," said the former Arsenal player. "They are very difficult teams to play against. The only good news for us is that AC Milan are out because they are a very strong team
