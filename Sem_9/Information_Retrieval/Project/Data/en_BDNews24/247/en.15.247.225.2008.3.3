<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday once again appealed to Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia to obey the laws of that country to stay there. The adviser made the appeal after publication of a report in the Saudi Gazette that the police had caught "red-handed" three Bangladeshis with hundreds of forged passes to Palaces of Saudi Princes. "Time and again we have appealed to all the members of the Bangladeshi community in Saudi Arabia to abide by the local laws," Iftekhar told bdbews24.com Monday. Iftekhar said Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus had also appealed to the Bangladeshis to obey Saudi laws. "We are confident that all members of the Bangladeshi community will pay heed to our appeals, and the huge majority will not suffer for the faults of a few," said Iftekhar. He added that flow of Bangladeshi workers to Saudi Arabia was continuing outnumbering other expatriate community there. The adviser said that 20,000 Bangladeshis went to Saudi Arabia in February alone. In recent days, the Saudi government has taken action against some Bangladeshis for violating local laws. bdn
