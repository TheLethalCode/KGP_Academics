 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  One more body was recovered Monday from the Buriganga river after a passenger ferry capsized five days ago, pushing the total death toll to 47. The man was identified as Habibur Rahman, 30, son of late Mohiuddin from Kandahar in Alamdanga upazila, Chuadanga. His father-in-law, Joj Miah, retrieved the body from the waters. Joj said he anchored on the accident site to find the body of his missing son-in-law after the rescue operation was called off following the retrieval of 39 bodies up to Friday. The official rescue team declared there were no more bodies, but many relatives continued to scour the river for their loved ones. Local people said Monday that a school boy, Sajib, and six workers were still missing. The Dohuri (Munshiganj) bound launch sank Thursday with about 150 passengers on board as a cargo vessel carrying sand rammed into it from behind. bdnews24.
