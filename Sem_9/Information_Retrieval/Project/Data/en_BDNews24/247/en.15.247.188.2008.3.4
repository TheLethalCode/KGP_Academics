 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com) -- A daring robbery took place inside a bank Tuesday morning which netted over Tk 12 lakh intended for the salaries of secondary and higher secondary education directorate employees, police said. Education directorate official Korban Khawaja told reporters that he withdrew Tk 12.24 lakh from the National Press Club branch of the Agrani Bank at around ten in the morning and placed the sum in his briefcase. The education directorate official said he then sat down at the desk of the principal officer of the branch, Mohammad Kabir. According to Korban, the briefcase and money were stolen while he was sitting at the desk. "While I was sitting at the principal officer's desk an unknown person approached me, and while pointing to some scattered money on the floor he said 'whose is that?'" Korban explained. "Notes of 10, 20 and 100 taka were lying on the floor. I checked my pocket to make sure it was not mine, it was then that I noticed my briefcase and the unknown man had gone," he said. The education directorate official added that he has been drawing salaries of employees for more than five years. The bank's principal officer Mohammad Kabir told reporters he did not know Korban Khawaja very well. "He is not a previous acquaintance of mine. He was sitting on the chair at my desk while I was busy with my work. It was then that I heard his briefcase had disappeared," said Kabir. Shahidul Islam, officer in charge of Shahbag Police Station, said the money had been stolen using a 'confidence trick'. Police are investigating the matter, although no arrests have so far been made. bdnews24.
