 BEIJING, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A top Chinese Communist Party official on Monday called for more economic and cultural exchanges with Taiwan and avoided mentioning the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control. The relatively low-key comments came just three weeks before self-ruled Taiwan holds a presidential poll, an event which in 1996 had been used as an opportunity by China to conduct war games close to the island. "We should ... actively promote cross-strait contacts and exchanges, improve mutual understanding, and promote economic, technological, educational and cultural exchanges across the Strait," Jia Qinglin told the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that meets once a year. Taiwan will hold an election on March 22 to choose a successor to President Chen Shui-bian, whose pro-independence steps have infuriated Beijing and led to a freeze in most political contact between the two sides, though not economic. Hoping that a candidate favouring eventual reunification will be elected, Beijing has been choosing its words about Taiwan with great care, and has largely avoided talking about the election. Beijing says reunifying with Taiwan is a supreme national goal and rejects any possibility of formal independence for the island that fell away from mainland control after Nationalist forces fled there in 1949 at the end of a civil war. Taiwan claims China aims hundreds of missiles at it. China has repeatedly said it will not rule out using armed force if Taiwan opts for formal independence, but Jia avoided such language in his speech before hundreds of officially-chosen academics, artists and members of minor parties that support the Communist Party. He made no mention of the election, saying only: "We should ... join hands together in opposing and containing separatist activities aimed at Taiwan independence". Jia, the Communist Party's fourth-ranked leader, also made reference to a previous religious meeting held by Buddhists from China and Taiwan. Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the advisory body, said on Sunday that "everyone was paying great attention" to Taiwan's poll. "We hope that the result of this election can improve Taiwan's economic development and ordinary people's lives, and is beneficial to the peaceful development of cross-strait relations," he told a news conference. "The biggest threat to cross-strait relations is 'Taiwan independence' activities, and we hope this kind of activity can be checked," Wu added. In 1996, China lobbed missiles into the Taiwan Strait to try and intimidate the island's voters not to vote for Lee Teng-hui, who Beijing despised for his perceived pro-independence sympathies.
