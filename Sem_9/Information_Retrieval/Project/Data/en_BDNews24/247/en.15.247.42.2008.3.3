<TITLE> Nigerian election dispute taken to Supreme Court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abuja, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One of the losing candidates from Nigeria's 2007 presidential election has appealed to the Supreme Court after a tribunal last week threw out his demand for a re-run, his lawyer said on Monday. Muhammadu Buhari, a former army head of state, had challenged the April poll victory of President Umaru Yar'Adua alleging widespread vote-rigging but the tribunal of five judges dismissed all his arguments in a Feb. 26 ruling. "We have appealed to the Supreme Court. We are going to do everything we can to be in court before the end of the month," Mike Ahamba, who represented Buhari at the tribunal, told Reuters by telephone. The appeal was expected. Buhari had said immediately after the ruling that he would not let the matter end there. Local and international observers had criticised the 2007 polls over widespread vote-rigging and intimidation. The European Union's observer mission said they "fell far short of basic international standards" and were "not credible". The legal wrangling over the outcome of the election undermined Yar'Adua's administration for months, slowing government business and investment decisions in Africa's most populous country and number one exporter of crude oil. Yar'Adua appears strengthened by last week's ruling and the pressure is now rising for him to deliver on his campaign promises to boost electricity generation, improve collapsed infrastructure and create jobs. Buhari's appeal to the Supreme Court prolongs the uncertainty, although the tribunal ruling was so decisive in rejecting every one of his points that it appears unlikely the Supreme Court would reach a different decision. A notice of appeal signed by Ahamba showed that he was appealing against the ruling on eight grounds, including that the judges had "failed to evaluate the plethora of documentary evidence" of fraud. He said he had presented evidence that showed results were manipulated in 80,000 out of 120,000 polling stations, affecting 28 million out of 36 million votes supposedly cast. Official results credited Yar'Adua with 24.6 million votes compared with 6.6 million for Buhari and 2.6 million for then Vice-President Atiku Abubakar. Both Buhari and Abubakar immediately challenged the results. Abubakar had also taken his case to the tribunal and after Tuesday's ruling he too said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, although he has yet to do so.
