<TITLE> Glanbia sees earnings growth as dairy market booms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBLIN, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish food group Glanbia posted a 25 percent rise in 2007 earnings on Wednesday and told Reuters earnings would grow almost 14 percent this year as it expects a boom in the global dairy market to continue. Glanbia, which describes itself as Europe's biggest supplier of pizza cheese, reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) before exceptional items of 28.2 cents, up from 22.6 in 2006 and in line with an average forecast of 28.2 cents in a Reuters survey of five analysts. Shares in Glanbia rose by about 3 percent after it said it was comfortable with market expectations for earnings per share of 32 cents in 2008 and may exceed that. "We set out some targets, I think in '06, of delivering over the three years from then about 10-14 percent growth in earnings, obviously we'll have exceeded that in '07 and we expect to be at the upper end of it in '08, which would get us off the back of at least 32 cents," Managing Director John Moloney told Reuters in an interview. Several analysts said they would raise their 2008 earnings forecasts, saying Glanbia's EPS could grow 15 percent in 2008. Glanbia's consumer foods division saw a fall in operating profit last year due to a lag in the recovery of higher milk costs, but Moloney said Glanbia would seek to pass on costs to consumers and that the dairy market environment was positive. Global dairy demand is growing by 2.4-2.5 percent while supply is only increasing by 1.7-1.8 percent, at a time when consumers in emerging economies are starting to spend more on dairy products, Moloney said. "We see prices being above the long-run averages for dairy out into the future," he said, adding that any downturn in developed economies would only have a limited effect on the food sector, where demand is fairly constant. ACQUISITIONS PIPELINE Glanbia, which processed 4.1 billion litres of milk last year, said unadjusted earnings per share fell 9 percent to 20.4 cents after taking a net exceptional charge of 20.4 million euros on the sale of its pig meat business to management. The firm received 35 million euros for the business, including insurance proceeds for assets destroyed in a major fire in August, but the amount received was under the unit's book value. Glanbia, which operates in Ireland, Britain, the United States, China and Nigeria, plans to use funds from its strong 2007 earnings to buy several US or European firms with a revenue of $100 million to $200 million each, Moloney said. "We have a reasonable pipeline under review and we'd be disappointed if we don't do a deal in 2008," he said. NCB analyst Paul Meade said Glanbia's exit from the meat sector and focus on dairy bode well for its earnings prospects. "The positive demand for dairy ingredients globally and shortage of product from the Southern Hemisphere now materialising due to weather, (mean) Glanbia is well positioned to deliver growth in line with our forecast mid-teen level in 2008, with upside arising from acquisitions," Meade said in a research note. Shares in Glanbia traded at 5.05 euros in Dublin at 1023 GMT, up 2.64 percent, outperforming a 1.9 percent rise in the wider Irish market, but below an earlier high of 5.15 eur
