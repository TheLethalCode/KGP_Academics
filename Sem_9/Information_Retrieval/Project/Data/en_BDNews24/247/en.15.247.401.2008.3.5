<TITLE> Referendum may break Serbia's EU deadlock: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Belgrade, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's ruling coalition is so divided on the European Union that citizens might be asked to decide in a referendum whether the country should seek or reject EU membership, Serbia's parliament speaker said. The prime minister does not want an EU link up without breakaway Kosovo, while the president advocates pushing on with membership. Oliver Dulic, Serbia's third most senior official, told daily Danas the government of nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and pro-Western president Boris Tadic would find it "impossible to survive" in such a climate of discord. Analysts say the disharmony is deterring much-needed investment and rattling the country's fragile markets. The dinar has lost five percent in two months and the index of most active stocks was down eight percent in the same period. Kostunica wants Serbia to reject ties with the EU until the bloc withdraws its backing for Kosovo, Serbia's former province which seceded last month. Tadic says these issues are not related, and nothing should jeopardise Serbia's development. Dulic, a member of Tadic's party, said that unless Kostunica backs down, a snap election or a referendum would be the only ways to break a possible "institutional deadlock". "We should go for early elections as soon as possible and let citizens decide on the future," he said in an interview published on Wednesday. "Whether at elections or at referendum, we have to ask citizens what they think." Kostunica recalled ambassadors from the United States and major EU nations that recognised Kosovo and wants to cool ties as long as the EU insists on sending a supervisory mission to guide the territory to full statehood. He backs a parliamentary resolution saying Serbia cannot join the bloc without Kosovo inside its borders. Dulic said the re-election of Tadic on Feb. 3 over a nationalist challenger showed Serbs see an EU future. After months of sitting on the sidelines while Kostunica worked up nationalist fervour, top liberals such as Dulic have started going on the offensive, especially after violent attacks against foreign embassies and firms in Belgrade late last month. The potential for crisis has not been lost on the EU. Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on Serbia to reaffirm it still sought closer EU ties. The bloc is due to set out plans on abolishing visas, increasing scholarships and offering more development help for all Balkan states in a bid to maintain public support. Analysts say Kostunica is single-minded in his campaign to save territory seen by Serbs as the national heartland, and is unlikely to be swayed by Western cajoling. "Since all parties are in favour of EU membership, there is no point in organising a referendum on whether we want to join the EU," the spokesman of Kostunica's party, Andreja Mladenovic, told Beta news agency on Wednesday. "We should rather have a vote on the issue of whether Serbia should go into the EU with Kosovo or without."
