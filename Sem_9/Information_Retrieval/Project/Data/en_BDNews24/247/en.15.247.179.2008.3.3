 PARIS, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in Airbus parent EADS soared on Monday after it won part of a $35 billion deal to supply the US military with refuelling planes, ousting archrival incumbent Boeing Co. A major breakthrough for the European firm in the world's biggest defence market, it surprised analysts and even company officials and threatens to trigger a political backlash in Washington and a challenge from Boeing. It offers hope for defence expansion plans at EADS which has struggled in recent years with costly delays of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, management feuds and a weak dollar that is forcing it to shed European factories and jobs. EADS shares in Paris rose as much as 11.2 percent, with a full day's average volume traded in less than an hour. At 1136 GMT, the stock was up 8.4 percent at 18.90 euros. French brokerage Oddo Securities raised its rating on EADS stock to 'add' from 'reduce' citing the boost the US deal will give the firm's efforts to reduce its heavy dependence on the cyclical airliner market and eurozone production. Airliners sell in dollars which has hurt Airbus as it sources many of its costs in euros. The euro stood close to its record high of $1.5240 on Monday. The contract has taken some pressure off of EADS ahead of its annual results next week when it is expected to report a 312 million euro loss for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts estimated the value of the contract at between 0.6 and 1.0 euros a share. The U.S. Air Force announced the award after a lengthy contest between Boeing and EADS teamed with U.S. defence contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. The deal sparked controversy in the United States over potential job losses to Europe but was hailed as a sign of improved European-U.S. relations by both France and Germany. Including follow-on orders and in-service maintenance, the aerial tanker contract could be the second costliest military aircraft purchase in coming decades, topped only by Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. ALABAMA ASSEMBLY The initial contract for the newly named KC-45 tanker, a modified Airbus A330 airliner, covers four test aircraft for $1.5 billion. With plans to buy 175 more planes, it would be worth $35 billion overall, the U.S. Air Force said. Airbus will provide A330 passenger jets, which usually sell to airlines for $172 million each, and a refuelling boom developed by EADS. The planes will be assembled in Alabama where Northrop will also fit them with military electronics. Washington hopes to start operating the new tankers in 2013. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Pentagon award demonstrated the "good and trusting cooperation with the United States in the areas of security policy". Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, called the contract an "exceptional success" and said it had been won without low-balling the price. "No we didn't smash the price," he told Reuters. However aerospace analyst Steve East at Credit Suisse said the deal may not generate significant profits for EADS and advised investors in a note to "sell into strength", saying the long-term challenges outweighed the positive short-term news. Citigroup Global Markets said the deal could lead to other contracts and boost export prospects for the existing EADS aerial refuelling tanker, which has already won competitions in Britian, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Australia. But it raised concerns over whether the European company would be protected under the hard-fought deal from swings in the dollar or have to absorb the full currency risk in its margins. Boeing can challenge the decision but said it would only decide whether to do so after a debriefing from Air Force officials. With the US economy in a slump and Boeing backers howling about job losses, the deal could also be held up in Congress where some lawmakers are angry that the purchase coincides with a major trade subsidy dispute between Washington and the European Union concerning Boeing and Airbus. The contract may be an issue in the presidential election. The likely Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, led an investigation that killed an earlier Air Force proposal to lease 100 Boeing 767 tankers after a former top Air Force official went to jail for negotiating a senior job with Boeing as she was still overseeing that deal and others. EADS will also be under pressure to deliver on time. It has been coping with industrial delays of at least six months in Europe's biggest military programme, the 20 billion euro A400M heavylifter programme, which come on top of a two-year delay in production of the A380 superjumbo jetliner. Citigroup said the risk of delays to the tanker programme were smaller since it was based on an existing aircra
