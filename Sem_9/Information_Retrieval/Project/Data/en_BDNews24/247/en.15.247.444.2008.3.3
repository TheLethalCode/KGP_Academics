 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  The decision to cut the interest rate on bank loans by a minimum of 1.0 percentage point takes effect from March, a spokesman for bank owners said Monday. In a meeting with the central bank, private banks made the proposal to narrow the interest rate spread, which received the green light from Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed. The retail banks have decided to keep the interest rate on deposits the same as now but cut the lending rate to lower the interest rate spread to below 5.0 percentage points. The decision was finalised at a meeting between the Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), an organisation of owners and the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), an organisation of bank executives. The decision will be fully implemented in three months from now, said BAB chairman Nazul Islam Mozumder. "We held several rounds of talks with the central bank on interest rate cuts, before we finalised the decision." BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed said: "BAB and ABB placed a rational proposal on cutting the rate of interest on bank loans, which I believe will increase investments in the country." "We have asked the banks to execute the move from March." The governor said the central bank would monitor regularly whether the retail banks were implementing their decisions properly. The retail banks also agreed to reduce different costs and commissions they charged clients for providing services, including opening letters of credit. "Earlier the commercial banks claimed charges of Tk 0.30 to Tk 0.80 from their clients to open a letter of credit worth Tk 100." "Now they have decided to charge Tk 0.50 from clients," Mazumder said. ABB chairman Kazi Mahmud Sattar told bdnews24.com: "We have decided to cut the rate of interest in all sectors, but we have put stress on loans to the industrial sector for which we have fixed the rate of interest at 14.75 percent." Steps will also be taken to reduce the rate of interest on loans for small and medium enterprises. Mazumder said, "We have decided that no interest rates cross 15 percent in any sector." "We will implement the decisions in phases." The average rate of interest on loans by 30 private banks was 13.91 percent and the rate of interest on deposits was 8.07 percent, with the interest rate spread at 5.84 percentage points. The average spread of four state-owned commercial banks was 5.95 percentage points, which means the average rate of interest on loans was 10.88 percent and the interest rate on deposits was 4.93 percent. The average spread of five specialised banks was 2.95 percentage points: the rate of interest on loans was 9.66 percent and the interest rate on deposits was 6.71 percent. The average spread of nine foreign banks was 8.83 percentage points: the interest rate on deposits was 5.05 percent and the interest rate on loans was 13.88 percent. bdnews
