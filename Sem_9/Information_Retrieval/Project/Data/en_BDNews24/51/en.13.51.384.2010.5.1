 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The recently issued rules of procedure for the Election Commission have reduced the power of the chief election commissioner relative to the other commissioners. The Election Commission Rules of Procedure, 2010 provide that all important acts will be accomplished by the commission - not by the chief election commissioner alone. "No programmes can be undertaken without a decision of the commission... Where there is any difference of opinion, it shall be resolved on the basis of the majority," the rules state. "The rules have brought a balance in the authority of the commissioners. It'll play an important role in effectively running the affairs of the EC secretariat," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com. Earlier, the chief election commissioner was vested with the sole authority to control the EC secretariat and its secretary was accountable only to him under the EC Secretariat Law, 2009. The two commissioners were aggrieved with the previous provisions and had expressed their disappointment on several occasions. The new rules, issued on 1 April, do, however, allow the CEC to take any urgent decisions himself - though he is required to have them approved at the next commission meeting. EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com that the new procedural rules have been formulated in line with the EC Secretariat Law, 2009 enacted in the first session of the ninth parliament. Although the commission is a constitutional body, its secretariat used to be under the Prime Minister Office until 2008 when the caretaker government amended the Representation of the People's Order to make it an independent organisation. Commenting on the new rules, former adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan told bdnews24.com: "The EC Secretariat Law, 2009 and the EC Rules of Procedure, 2010 have clearly determined the authority and jurisdiction of the persons concerned. It'll bring dynamism and enhance transparency and accountability to EC activities." RULES OF PROCEDURE The rules say that the CEC will preside over the commission meetings and in his absence the most senior commissioner will act on his behalf - seniority being determined by how long they have been commissioners. When two commissioners have taken the oath on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of their age It says the secretary will make draft minutes of EC meetings through a deputy secretary and submit it to the commissioners for approval. If any commissioner finds any flaws in the minutes, he can send it back to the secretary for correction. It imposes restrictions on divulging EC meeting-related information to the media and gives the commission secretary the responsibility for briefing the media - though other people can be given this responsibility. bdne
