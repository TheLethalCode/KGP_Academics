 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) Ruling Awami League policymaker Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir has asked the Anticorruption Commission to apologise for its two years' activities during the caretaker government regime. "We don't need the Anticorruption Commission that worked for the caretaker government," Alamgir, also the chairman of parliamentary standing committee on public accounts, told reporters emerging from a meeting on Monday. He also defended the amendment proposal of ACC law as being positive. But Monday's committee meeting did not discuss the matter.
