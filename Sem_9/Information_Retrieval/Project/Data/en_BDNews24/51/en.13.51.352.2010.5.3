<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has upheld a High Court ruling that had ordered dismantling of illegal structures on the banks of four rivers in and around Dhaka city. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Md Fazlul Karim gave the order on Monday. The High Court on June 26, 2009 ordered the government to demolish all illegal structures encroaching on the four riversthe Buriganga, Turag, Sitalakhya and Balu--on a petition by rights group Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Another High Court ruling on Jan 24 this year ordered the government to begin demolishing by February the illegal structures on the banks tosafeguard the ecologically threatened rivers which circle the capital. In line with the order, on Feb 9 the Narayanganj district authorities sent a notice to six industrial groups to remove their illegal structures on the bank of Sitalakhya. The industrial groups are City Group, Scan Cement, Akiz Group, Molla Salt, Kamal Vegetable and ACI Group. But they petitioned the High Court against the district authorities' move, which the court rejected. The six groups later filed a petition against the High Court ruling, which the Supreme Court turned down on Monday. The lawyers for the petitioners said at the hearing that the industries had built jetties with legal licences, which is why the High Court ruing should not be applicable to them. Rafique-ul-Haque, Rokanuddin Mahmud and Mahmudul Islam, who stood for the petitioners, said the demolition notices were illegal. Advocate Manzil Morshed, lawyer for Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, argued that the notices were served after earmarking the establishments. bdn
