<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission on Sunday decided again to ask Jamaat-e-Islami to amend its constitution so that it conforms to electoral laws and the country's constitution. The commission will tell the fundamentalist Islamist party to amend certain sections of its constitution by May 31 so that they are compatible with the Representation of the People's Order. The Commission considers there to be at least seven articles in Jamaat's constitution that require changing. NI Khan, joint secretary (law) of the EC Secretariat and convener of the committee on scrutinising party constitutions, told bdnews24.com, "EC has decided to write to Jamaat-e-Islami asking it to amend the controversial articles." The letter will be sent to the party secretary on Monday, he said, adding that that it was the second time that the Election Commission was requesting the party to make the changes. The commission had earlier written to 14 political parties, including Jamaat, asking them to amend sections of their constitutions. Khan said the EC had set a further deadline for Jamaat as it had failed to respond to the EC's earlier call and will decide what course of action it will take if Jamaat fails to respond by then.. Earlier on Mar 25, election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told reporters that measures would be taken in line with the registration guidelines if any party failed to amend its constitution accordingly. Guidelines allow for the scrapping of registration if amended constitutions are not submitted. Shakhawat said, "Although the EC is empowered to scrap party registration, it should not be done hastily." The parties could consult with the EC, which will help resolve their problems, he had added. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojahid told bdnews24.com on Mar 24 that Jamaat leaders had agreed to make two amendments. They, however, did not agree to make the remaining amendments, Mojahid said, adding that they would seek clarification on the articles when they talked with EC. "We will sit with EC after discussing the party constitution at the meeting of majlish-e-sura (the top policy making body of the party)." According to the EC's review committee, the party must be run through democratic processes in line with the constitution of Bangladesh. There is no scope to establishing Islamic rule in the state, the committee observed and stated that elements of the constitution of Jamaat-e-Islami goes against the spirit of the constitution of Bangladesh. A total of 39 political parties registered with the EC on the basis of their revised constitution before the ninth parliamentary elections. EC scrapped the registration of Freedom Party as it failed to submit its constitution by Jan 25. bdnews24.
