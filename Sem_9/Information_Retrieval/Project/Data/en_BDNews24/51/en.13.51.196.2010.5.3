 GROS ISLET, St Lucia, May 2 (bdnews24.com)-- Australia made an impressive start to their Twenty20 World Cup campaign with Shane Watson hammering 81 from 49 balls in a convincing 34-run victory over Pakistan on Sunday. Australia's innings ended in bizarre fashion with a five wicket maiden but their total of 191 was always going to be tough for Pakistan. Despite a lively 41 by Misbah-ul-Haq and 33 off 24 balls from Shahid Afridi, Australia never offered them more than a glimmer of hope. There was some good bowling, with three wickets each for pacemen Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes, and outstanding catching from Australia which ensured they kept the upper-hand, bowling out their opponents with the final ball. Along with the resounding display from Michael Clarke's team, the game will be remembered for a remarkable final over to Australia's innings, in which left-arm pace bowler Mohammad Aamer picked up three wickets while Mike Hussey and Steven Smith were both run out. Australia punished lax Pakistan fielding. Watson, dropped on 11 by Misbah-ul-Haq at midwicket and missed by Misbah, running back at mid-on, both times off Mohammad Hafeez, struck four sixes and seven fours in his blistering 49-ball innings Together with David Hussey, he put on 98 in under nine overs for the third wicket. Hussey, dropped on 18 at long-off by Salman Butt, a relatively easy chance, went on to make 53 off 29 balls with five sixes and two fours. Hussey was especially severe on seamer Mohammad Sami, striking him for 28 runs in the 16th over with the batsman striking four sixes, including three in a row. Eventually Hussey holed out off Saeed Ajmal and, three balls later, Clarke was lbw to the off-spinner to leave Australia 164 for four in the 17th over. There was though an extraordinary end to the Australia innings with five wickets going down for no runs in six balls during the last over from fast bowler Mohammad Aamer. Brad Haddin was caught off the over's first ball, Mitchell Johnson clean bowled off the second with both Michael Hussey and Steven Smith run out by direct hits from wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal as they tried to run byes. Shaun Tait survived the fifth ball but was bowled off the last for nought. Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 21 runs in their first match of the tournament here on Saturday. (Reuters,
