<TEXT>
 Lalmonirhat May 03 (bdnews24.com)  The district Bus, Truck and Motor Owners' Association of Lalmonirhat has called a transport strike in reaction to the attack on the transport owners. The 48-hour strike has started today and is set to continue tomorrow. According to the truck owners and other local sources, the District Truck and Tank-Lorry Labour Union collected tolls from different trucks to observe May Day. But they had also collected from every vehicle at Mostafihat last Wednesday, which gave rise to a dispute among the transport workers. The workers became agitated when the association president Abdul Hakim, general secretary Ashraful Ali Laal and some other owners went there and tried to stop them. The labourers attacked the owners including the association president and the general secretary at this time. Following this, the leaders of the owners' association submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner (DC) on Apr 29. Ashraful said they went to Mostafihat hearing of extortion from the trucks. They asked the workers including their leader Pulin to stop doing so. "But they did not pay heed, rather some of the labourers insulted us," he said. Later the police came and rescued them. A general diary was submitted in the police station regarding this, Ashraful added. However, the labour union convenor Pulin Chandra Barman denied the accusations. He claimed that he went to Mostafihat that day to verify the identity of the workers of that branch. But the general secretary of the owners' association and some others beat him there. The local workers rescued him and confined the owners, he added. Sadr Police Station sub inspector Kiran Chandra said they went to the spot after hearing the news of collision and rescued the owners. DC Md Alauddin Fakir said that the owners' association alleged extortion by workers earlier also. He solved those disputes by sitting with both the parties. He asked the owners and workers to come on Sunday. Though the labour leaders came, the owners did not, he added. bdnews
