<TITLE> Nadal recovers clay court form </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal rediscovered his clay court form after a rare wobble in the semi-finals to beat fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 7-5, 6-2 in Sunday's rain-hit final and claim his fifth Rome Masters title in six years. The chinks in the armour that Latvian Ernests Gulbis exposed in Saturday's three-setter were not in evidence as Ferrer never threatened an upset. The third seed broke serve twice in the gap between two rain interruptions to take the first set and assume command of the second before cruising home.

Nadal turned up the heat and Ferrer surrendered serve again after some valiant resistance in the third game of the second set before the downpours caused another delay. Ferrer, whipped in the semi-finals by Nadal at Monte Carlo 15 days ago, then caved in on serve again with a sloppy game and Nadal held his with ease to triumph more than four hours after the match had started. "Maybe the court was slower and I had problems to make points (after the first rain stop)," Ferrer said. "Rafa had chances in important moments and it's difficult to beat him but I'm happy with my game." Sunday's victory gave six-time Grand Slam winner Nadal his 17th career Masters title to equal Andre Agassi's tally. "I hope to improve his record but you never know," he said. "I'm 23 and I'm happy about what I've done. Seventeen is a very important num
