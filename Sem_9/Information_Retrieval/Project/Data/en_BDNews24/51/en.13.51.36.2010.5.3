 Jahangirnagar University, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  Five students were suspended on Monday over clashes between rival groups of pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League. The five were dismissed for three months, a statement, signed by registrar Abu Bakar Siddiq, said on Monday. Proctor Arzu Mia told bdnews24.com that the decision was taken in line with the suggestions by a disciplinary body. The tudents are Syed Nazmul Hossain (Physics, 37th batch), M Farhadur Rahman (Physics, 34th batch), Md Wazid Hossain Bappy (Physics, 34th batch), Md Zahirul Islam (Mathematics, 32nd batch) and Rezaul Karim Reza (Mathematics, 35th batch). A meeting of the disciplinary committee was held on Sunday evening where the members suggested punishment of those involved in the clash. The clash on Apr 29 involved two feuding groups of Bangabandhu Hall about congratulating the winning teachers in the university's senate election. Witnesses said that after the poll result was published at 10pm on Thursday, Bangabandhu Hall Chhatra League leader Samiul Bashir Sami and his followers went to congratulate the victors. On their return to the hall, other Chhaatra league activists, led by SM Shamim, rebuked them. At one stage, both the factions fought each other leaving six of the activists including Sami and Shamim seriously injured. bdne
