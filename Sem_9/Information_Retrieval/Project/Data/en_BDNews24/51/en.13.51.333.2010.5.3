 DHAKA, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh have called up uncapped paceman Robiul Islam in their 15-man squad for the two-Test series against England starting later this month. Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who made a comeback to the national side for the World Twenty20, has not been included. The 23-year-old right-armer from Khulna Division has been a prolific wicket-taker in domestic cricket and is currently involved in a home series for Bangladesh A team against South Africa A team. "He brings in a lot of energy and has brisk pace. Robiul is strong and aggressive and we feel he can be a handy option in English conditions," said chairman of selectors Rafiqul Alam. Former captain and veteran batsman Mohammad Ashraful also made his way back into the Test side after he missed the home series against same opponents in February-March. Ashraful showed signs of regaining his form in making 65 off 49 balls in Bangladesh's first match in the ICC World Twenty20 that nearly upset defending champions Pakistan on Saturday. Middle-order batsman Aftab Ahmed and left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr have been excluded from the Test side to accommodate uncapped Robiul and paceman Mahbubul Alam, who has been recalled. The first Test starts at Lord's on May 27 with the second Test in Manchester on June 4. Squad: Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mohammad Ashraful, Junaed Siddique, Jahirul Islam, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Mahbubul Alam and Robiul I
