 Rangamati, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  A special court trying 75 suspected BDR mutineers of 9 Rifles Battalion at Marishya has started to hear witnesses. The court heard statements of 12 witnesses on the first day on Monday after proceedings resumed after a three-month recess. The court was previously adjourned on Feb 18 after six witnesses had testified. A total of 85 witnesses have been called for the trial. The special court-4, set up at the Rangamati BDR headquarters, began hearing witnesses from 9am. The court continued its proceeding until 1pm and was adjourned until 9am on Tuesday. The second mutiny trial in the region began on Dec 30, 2009. The verdict in the first trial against 12 Rifles Battalion at Rajnagar in Rangamati was delivered on Sunday. On Monday, all the accused BDR men were brought to the court from the district jail under tight security. Lt Col Shamimur Rahman, prosecutor of the case, told journalists that of the 12 witnesses, one is a retired officer of BDR and the rest 11 are from Marishya. Among the accused there are three Subedars, five Nayek Subedars, 12 Habildars, nine Nayeks, 14 Lance Nayeks and 32 Sepoys. BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam headed the panel of judges, with Lt Col Abdur Rouf and Maj Golam Mostafa Al Mamun being the other judges. Deputy attorney general Mohammed Suhrawardy assisted the court on behalf of the attorney general, while Mosharraf Hossain Kajol represented the state. The accused were assisted by lawyers SM Abdur Rouf and Kazi Boshir Ahmed. The 75 border guards of the 9 Rifles Battalion stand accused of rebellion in solidarity with the mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26, 2009 that resulted in the death of more than 70 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson under BDR law. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. bdnews24.co
