 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdbews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Sunday granted police three days, for the second time, to quiz Zakir Hossain and Ali Haider, arrested by RAB, in relation to the killing of sub-inspector Gautam Roy. Detective Branch inspector and investigation officer Ruhul Amin requested for a five-day remand. Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mostafa Shahriar Khan granted three days after the hearing. The request said they needed time to recover arms used in the killing and to detain the others involved. The police officer, based at Bangshal Police Station, was shot dead at Dholaikhal on Apr 20 midnight while returning home after duty. RAB on Apr 25 arrested Zakir alias 'Kailya' Zakir, 25, and Haider from the city's Jatrabari and Lalmohan Saha Street. They were earlier remanded on Apr 27 for four days. Moreover, Johnny Hossain Manik, arrested from the court premises on Apr 28, suspected for having links with the case, was sent to jail after a two-day remand. bd
