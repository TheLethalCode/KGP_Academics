<TEXT>
 BERLIN, May 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Germany coach Joachim Loew said Monday that Schalke striker Kevin Kuranyi, one of the Bundesliga's top scorers this season, will not be in the World Cup squad to be unveiled later this week. "After full consideration in the training team we came to the conclusion that we have other ideas for the make-up of our World Cup team, both tactically and when it comes to personnel," Loew said. "I said this quite openly to Kevin." Kuranyi, 28, who has played 52 times for Germany, has had the best season of his career, scoring 18 goals with Schalke, who are second in the Bundesliga, three points behind Bayern Munich with one game to play.

"The disciplinary event ... didn't matter to me at the end of the day. It would not have been a problem to have given him another chance in the national team.

Another is Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling, top scorer in the Bundesliga this season, level with Wolfsburg's Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko with 21 goals. The final decision on which 23 players will travel to South Africa for the June 11 to July 11 tournament is expected to be made during the team's training camp in northern Italy in time for FIFA's June 1 deadline. "I gave all I could this season on the pitch, but sadly it wasn't enough," Kuranyi said. "But it is the national coach's decision, and I respect and accept it. I wish the coach and all the team all the best for South Africa. "Like every fan, I will have my fingers crossed in front of the TV." Germany have drawn Australia, Serbia and Ghana in Gro
