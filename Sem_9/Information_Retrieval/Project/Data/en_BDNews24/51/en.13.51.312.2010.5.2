 ROME, May 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Roma moved a point clear of Inter Milan at the summit of Serie A on Saturday after goals from Francesco Totti and Rodrigo Taddei earned a nervous 2-1 win at Parma. Ahead of Inter's away match in Rome against Lazio on Sunday, Totti struck after five minutes and Taddei doubled the lead with a quarter of an hour to go after Parma had bossed the match. Substitute Davide Lanzafame's 81st-minute strike set up a tense finale, but Roma, seeking their first scudetto since 2001, held on and with two matches to play will now be cheering on their city rivals. "I told my players to battle and then see if the ball would run for us. Last week it went against us but today it went for us," admitted Roma coach Claudio Ranieri, whose team slumped to a 2-1 home defeat to Sampdoria last weekend. "I'm not thinking about Lazio but obviously if they play their part tomorrow's game should be a tough one to win." Roma skipper Totti gave his team the perfect start with a superbly taken goal on five minutes. Chesting down a fine through ball from fellow Roman Daniele De Rossi, Totti calmly lobbed a stranded Antonio Mirante for the simplest of strikes. Sampdoria's smash-and-grab comeback last weekend still seemed to be on Roma's minds though and Julio Sergio was kept busy as the home side quickly carved out chances. The Brazilian goalkeeper saved from Jonathan Biabiany on 18 minutes before finger-tipping Francesco Valiani 20-yard effort around the post. Luca Antonelli nodded Valiani's centre into the side-netting on 35 minutes, Biabiany then headed over and Hernan Crespo, on for Bojinov, shot inches wide on 53 minutes as Roma wobbled. Seconds later Totti cracked a right-footer against the upright before Lanzafame's left-foot strike clipped the crossbar with both sides pressing for the critical second goal. It was Roma who won with 15 minutes to go when Totti delivered the perfect centre for Taddei to head into the far corner to double the lead. Six minutes later though Biabiany crossed for Lanzafame to head home for 2-1 and set up a frantic 10-minute finale in which Parma's Luis Jimenez was sent off after a second caution. "Lazio are playing for survival so I expect them to play like Parma did against us today," said midfielder Daniele De Rossi whose side are seeking a fourth title. "We'll believe in the scudetto until the final minute of the season." At the San Siro, AC Milan consolidated third place, going seven points above Sampdoria after inching past Fiorentina 1-0 in a subdued affair. After Marco Borriello headed wide on 18 minutes, the match developed into a contest between Ronaldinho and Sebastien Frey. First the Brazilian tried a cheeky finish at the near post, then a clever flicked header eight yards out before bending two 25-yard free kicks either side of half-time. But on each occasion though the goalkeeper stood firm, parrying to safety. After Clarence Seedorf blasted over from the edge of the box on 70 minutes, Ronaldinho finally got the better of Frey - but only from the penalty spot following Per Kroldrup'd two-footed lunge on Marco Borriello. With three minutes to go Massimo Ambrosini was sent off after a second caution but late long-range efforts from Juan Vargas were too little too late for Fiorentina, who stay ninth ahead of Sunday's fixt
