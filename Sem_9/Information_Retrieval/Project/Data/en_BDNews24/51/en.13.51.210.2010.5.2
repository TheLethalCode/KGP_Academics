 Bangkok, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security forces in Thailand threatened to dislodge anti-government protesters on Sunday from one of the areas they have occupied in central Bangkok, using force if necessary. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told reporters late on Saturday the government had ordered police to regain the area around Chulalongkorn Hospital, near the Silom business district, to ensure safety for the public there. "Tomorrow the police chief has to continue clearing the area by all means, from talks to the use of force if necessary," Sansern told reporters. "We believe the police can handle this. If we have to use force, it does not mean that we want to disperse protesters at Rachaprasong junction, but we just want the hospital area back." That junction is a ritzy shopping area that the red-shirted protesters have occupied since April 3 as part of their movement to force early elections, prompting the closure of many malls and luxury hotels. "Red shirt" demonstrators, supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, caused outrage when about 200 of them barged into the hospital grounds on Thursday, looking for soldiers they thought were stationed there and preparing an attack. Their leaders apologised and have moved back part of their barricade in the area to allow better access to the hospital. However, that appears to be the only concession and around 1,000 demonstrators were behind the barricade by the business district by daylight. There were no more police than normal in recent days and no attempt to dislodge them, a Reuters photographer said. The protest rally is now in its eighth week in the capital and the authorities have found no way to disperse it without the risk of serious bloodshed. Some evenings, tens of thousands of protesters gather in the occupied shopping district. DEATHS One bungled attempt to dislodge them from a different part of Bangkok on April 10 ended with 25 people dead and more than 800 wounded. Another person died in still-unexplained grenade attacks on the Silom business district on April 22 and a soldier died in skirmishes on a suburban highway on April 28. One conflict resolution body, the International Crisis Group, said the standoff could deteriorate into an "undeclared civil war" and said neutral figures with authority could help a slide into greater violence. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was due to hold a cabinet meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis. The "red shirts" say he came to power illegitimately at the head of a coalition put together with the backing of the military. Thaksin, who was toppled in a bloodless coup in 2006, lives abroad to escape a jail sentence handed down for corruption. Bangkok anxiously awaits an army operation to evict the red shirts from their tent city, fortified at six entry points with barriers of tyres doused in fuel, razor wire and sharpened bamboo poles. The fault lines are widening between the establishment -- big business, aristocrats, the military brass and the middle class -- and the protesters drawn from the rural and urban poor. The crisis has cast a pall over the economy, decimating the tourist industry, closing businesses and depressing consumer confidence. Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij said on Friday economic growth could be cut by 2 percentage points if it continues all
