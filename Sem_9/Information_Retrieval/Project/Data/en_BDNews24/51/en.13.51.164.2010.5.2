 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruk Khan has blamed the international market trend on price hike of yarn and collusion of businesses. He said the local businessmen were exploiting the price hike to make windfall profits. He also said that it was necessary to import yarn from African countries and India, and called for initiatives from businessmen along with the government. The minister was addressing a programme, unveiling Sramabarta's yearly issue and awarded the top ten labour-friendly knitwear factories, at Osmani Memorial Auditorium, organised by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) on Sunday. BKMEA chief M Fazlul Hoque, vice-president MA Rashed and others also spoke at the programme. Later the minister handed over the awards. Abani Knitwears Ltd, Irish Fabrics Ltd, Interstof Apparels Ltd, Grameen Knitwear Ltd, Ragadi Textiles Ltd, Vieratex Ltd, Concern Ltd, Fakir Apparels Ltd, 4H Lingerie Ltd and Benetex Ltd received awards for being labour-friendly. Khan said that a conspiring section was responsible for the recent workers unrest and that their identities have been found out with the help of owners and workers. Legal steps will be taken against them. Addressing the issue of the yarn price hike, the minister said, "Prices have suddenly gone up in the international market making the market somewhat unstable." "But it is also true that some unfair businessmen are also trying to exploit the situation." The commerce minister, highlighting the necessity of good relations between workers and owners, said that the industry could not flourish without it. He also expressed hope that the new wage structure will be in place soon. b
