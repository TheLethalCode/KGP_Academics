 Gazipur, May 1 (bdnews24.com)A domestic aid in Gazipur is about to die because of torture by her mistress. The victim Shimu, 11, hails from Namazpur in Pirojpur. She worked at a house at Arispur of Tangi upazila. Shimu accidentally broke a flower vase on Wednesday when she was tidying a room of the house. The mistress of the house, Mahfuza Akthar Soma, became enraged. She then inserted a hot cooking implement, commonly called khunti (iron ladle) into Shimu's anus. Although Shimu was seriously injured her employers did not take her to a doctor or arrange for medical attention. She was unable to answer the call of nature and thus her stomach became inflated. Soma went away after taking Shimu to the emergency department of Tangi Government Hospital on Friday night. Md Ismail Hossain, a doctor of the hospital said on Saturday that her stomach was inflated because of an infected anus. She is also running a high fever. She was sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Friday night as her situation worsened. Mostafizur Rahman, a sub-inspector of Tangi Police Station said that the child was not given treatment to hide the torture. The extent of torture, however, was evident after she was brought to the hospital, he said. Md Shahin, a sub-inspector of Tangi Police Station filed a case on Friday in this concern. Soma, Shimu's employer was arrested the same night. But she denied that she had tortured the child. Shimu has been working in Soma's house for 5 years. bdnew
