 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Sayeed Eskandar, the brother of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, as well as her advisor, secured six months' anticipatory bail on Monday from the High Court in a corruption case. The court also asked the government to explain why Eskander should not be permitted permanent bail. The bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhad Miah and JBM Hasan granted bail on Eskander's petition. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan and barrister Badruddoza Badal stood for the BNP leader at the court while deputy attorney general Bhismadeb Chakrabarty represented the government. The advisers of Eskander told the court that the cases were filed against him from 'political ill motives'. The Anti-Corruption Commission on Apr 28 filed the case against Eskandar with Ramna Police. He was charged with amassing illegal wealth and failing to provide information about his wealth in a statement he submitted to the commission. Sub-inspector of Ramna Police Station Rozina Akhtar had previously told bdnews24.com that the case was filed against Eskandar for concealing information more than Tk 47 million. The commission has filed several other corruption cases against Eskandar. bdne
