 Rangamati, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  The special BDR court in Rangamati has convicted all nine BDR members charged with mutiny. One of the mutineers was given the highest penalty of 7 years in prison. This is the fifth court to hand down a verdict relating to charges over the BDR mutiny. Special tribunals in Satkhira, Feni, Panchagar and Thakurgaon have also given verdicts previously. The nine border guards of the 12 Rifles Battalion were convicted of rebellion in solidarity with the mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Pilkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26, 2009 that resulted in the death of more than 70 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson under BDR law. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. The Rangamati court was the first to begin trials for mutiny on Nov 24. bdnews24
