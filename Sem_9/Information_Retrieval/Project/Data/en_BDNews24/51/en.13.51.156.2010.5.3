 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Dhaka, May 03 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Bhutan are set to enter a reciprocal arrangement on the import and export of seasonal vegetables While Bhutan looks set to export winter vegetables to Bangladesh at the height of summer, Bangladesh could export them in winter when temperatures in Bhutan are forbiddingly low for much farming activity. Consumers in Bangladesh can look forward to getting winter vegetables such as cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes this summer as Bhutan is likely to export them from July, officials say. According to an agreement, winter vegetables from the Himalayan kingdom will get duty-free access to Bangladesh market. This process will be facilitated by the fact that India will allow good-laden Bhutanese trucks to travel up to Bangladesh border through its territories.. In Bhutan, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, beans and other vegetables grow in June-July when temperature rises above 15 degrees Celsius. But Bangladesh's weather does not permit cultivation of such vegetables due to heavy rainfall with the mercury rising well above 30 degrees Celsius. "We are very grateful that Bangladesh has given duty-free access to 18 Bhutanese products that includes vegetables," Daw Penjo, Bhutan's foreign secretary, told bdnews24.com last week. He said his country could export winter vegetables to Bangladesh in June-July and import them from November to March when they become abundant in Bangladesh and scarce in Bhutan. "Hopefully we will be able to export winter vegetables to Bangladesh from this June-July," Sonam Tshering, Bhutanese secretary for economic affairs, told bdnews24.com at his Thimphu office on Apr 27. He said Bhutanese farmers used to only produce vegetables to meet their own demands as there were no opportunities to export the produce. "We have already started encouraging the Bhutanese farmers to produce more vegetables as Bangladesh can consume a huge quantity," said Tshering. The secretary said prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her Bhutan visit last November said she would allow vegetables to get duty-free access to help the poor Bhutanese farmers. Again, the farmers in Bangladesh would be benefited by exporting vegetables to Bhutan in November to March. "This will bring benefit for both countries," said Tshering. "We can export vegetables to Bangladesh as India allows Bhutanese trucks to move freely through Indian territories," said the secretary. Dhaka and Delhi in January agreed that Bhutan and Nepal would use Indian territories to trade with Bangladesh. Bangladesh's nearest land port Burimari is over 60 kilometres off the Bhutanese border. Tamabil is another land port that the Bhutanese use. Thimphu recently proposed another land port in Nakugaon in Sherpur which will be the nearest port for Bhutan. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan amount to less than $1 million, while Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh stand at around $14 million according to the commerce ministry. Bhutan's main exports are minerals, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oats. Commerce ministry officials say if Bhutan can export winter vegetables, consumers in Bangladesh will get them at more affordable prices. Bangladesh produces a huge quantity of cauliflowers, cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes and others between November and March. The winter vegetables turn so cheap that sometimes farmers are forced to let them rot in the field. But these are not available during summer. The little that are available, are so costly that ordinary consumers cannot afford them. Diplomatic observers say that Bangladesh may not be in a position to export vegetables to Bhutan as Delhi is yet to allow Bangladeshi trucks go up to the India-Bhutan border through its territories. But foreign ministry officials expect that India might soon give that permission.
