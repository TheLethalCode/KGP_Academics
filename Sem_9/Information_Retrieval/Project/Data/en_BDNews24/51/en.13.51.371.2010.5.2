<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)The ownership of one of the country's leading newspapers, Ittefaq has changed hands. Children of the newspaper's founder Tofazzal Hossain Manik Mia signed a deal on Sunday at the Sheraton Hotel to that effect. This deal essentially gives ownership of Ittefaq's title and goodwill to Anwar Hossain Manju and his sisters, while his brother Mainul Hosein was given ownership of the building. One of the oldest and most prestigious Bengali newspapers in Bangladesh, Mainul's share of Ittefaq was valued at Tk 10 crore. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque, representing Manju and present at the closed-door meeting at Sheraton, confirmed bdnews24.com of the deal. He said Manju, his sisters and all their children would remain the owners of Ittefaq. "Mainul Hosein for his part will get Tk 10 crore, ownership of the building and some other property." The brothers have been involved in a long drawn out rivalry over the years but it came to a head last year. The two brothers have taken their turns in running the influential newspaper as political power seesawed between them. Mainul became law adviser to the 2007-2008 military-installed caretaker government before he quit abruptly. Manju, head of his faction of the Jatiya Party, was forced into exile facing a slew of charges, and was convicted in more than one case, during the period when Mainul was adviser. Mainul, chairman of the editorial board, took over control of the paper this period. But previously Manju has acted as the publisher and editor of Ittefaq too. Manju was a powerful member of the ousted military dictator HM Ershad's cabinet in the 1980s. Subsequently, he was communications minister in the 1996-2001 cabinet of Sheikh Hasina, the incumbent prime minister. Ittefaq was founded by Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani and Yar Mohammad Khan, and it started publication on Dec 24, 1953. As both men were occupied in active politics and in the anti-Pakistan movement, they appointed Tofazzal Hossain as its editor, who was then working in Kolkata as a journalist. Ittefaq had a significant role in the general elections of 1954, and it contributed to the victory of the United Front. The broadsheet strongly opposed all military rule in Pakistan starting from those under Ayub Khan to Yahya Khan. President Ayub Khan censored its publication from June 17 to July 11, 1966, and then again from July 17, 1966 to Feb 9, 1969. The editor Tofazzal Hossain, popularly known as Manik Mia, was imprisoned several times. Manik Mia died on June 1, 1969, and since then the newspaper has been managed by his two sons. The Ittefaq's office was burnt down by the Pakistan army on Mar 25, 1971. Its publication could not be resumed until May 21, 1971 under direct control of Pakistani officials. Ittefaq was nationalised on Jun 17, 1975. Nurul Islam Patwary was made the chief editor and it was published from New Nation Press at 1 Ramkrishna Mission Road, Dhaka. Ownership was returned to Manik Mia's sons on August 24, 1975. bdn
