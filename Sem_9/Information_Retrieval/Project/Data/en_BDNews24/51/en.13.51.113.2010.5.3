 MUMBAI, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court on Monday found Pakistani citizen Mohammad Ajmal Kasab guilty of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the first verdict delivered in a case that has worsened ties between New Delhi and Islamabad.

Two Indian nationals accused of being members of the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and of conducting reconnaissance in Mumbai before the attack, were aquitted of all charges, according to the court. The Mumbai attack prompted New Delhi to break off peace talks with Pakistan, saying Islamabad must first act against militants operating from its soil, including the LeT, of which Kasab is accused of being a member.
