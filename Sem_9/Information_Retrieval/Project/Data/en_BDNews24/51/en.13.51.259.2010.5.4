 Pabna, May 3 (bdnews24.com) -- At least 30 people were injured in a student-police clash in Pabna on Monday over formation of pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League's new district and Government Edward College committees. Pabna Sadar Police Station officer in charge Matiar Rahman told bdnews24.com that the clash broke out at noon when students, failing to secure positions in the new committees, threw stones at the police during a procession taken out on the campus demanding dissolution of the committees. The injured, who include the officer in-charge, sub-inspector Shaheed, assistant sub-inspector Bijoy and 10 constables of police and newly elected president of BCL's Edward College unit MA Sajib, were admitted to Pabna Sadar Hospital. Additional police have been deployed on the college campus and at important places in the town. Earlier, on Sunday, the agitating BCL activists went on the rampage across the town. Police said outgoing general secretary of BCL district unit Mostak Ahmed Azad and general secretary of Jatiya Jubo League's Sadar upazila unit Sajjad Hossain have been arrested in connection with the incident. Preparation was on for filing case over the incident on Monday night, they said. The new committees were formed on Sunday in the organisation's district council where state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku was the chief guest. BCL central committee president Mahmud Hasan Ripon declared the names of the new committees in the afternoon. But a section of the BCL activists, failing to get any positions, started demanding that the 'pocket committees' be dissolved. They claimed the committees have been formed at Circuit House, not at the council, ignoring the opinion of the councillors. bd
