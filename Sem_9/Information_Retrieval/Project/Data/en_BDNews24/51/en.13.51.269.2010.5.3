 Rangamati, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  A special court trying 75 suspected BDR mutineers of 9 Rifles Battalion at Marishya in Rangamati resumed proceedings on Monday after a three-month recess. The special court-4, set up at the Rangamati BDR headquarters, began hearing witnesses from 9am. The court was previously adjourned on Feb 18 after six witnesses had testified. A total of 85 witnesses have been called for the trial. The second mutiny trial in the region began on Dec 30, 2009. The verdict in the first trial against 12 Rifles Battalion at Rajnagar in Rangamati was delivered on Sunday. The 75 border guards of the 9 Rifles Battalion are accused of rebellion in solidarity with the mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Pilkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26, 2009 that resulted in the death of more than 70 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson under BDR law. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. bd
