<TITLE> Pakistan Taliban leader threatens US cities </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has vowed to attack major US cities in two purported new videos released months after his reported killing in a US missile strike. The videos emerged after an attempted car bombing in New York City, for which his faction claimed responsibility in a third video, and provided the most substantial evidence so far that he survived a barrage of US missiles. Mehsud threatened to retaliate against the United States within a month for the killing of Islamist militant leaders, appearing in a nine-minute video allegedly made on April 4, after his supposed death in January. "The time is very near when our fedayeen will attack the American states in the major cities," said Mehsud, who was seen flanked by two armed and masked men in the video released by the SITE and IntelCenter monitoring groups. The video is the first showing Mehsud since January and was issued on the heels of a claim by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan that it was behind the attempted bombing in New York's Time Square on Saturday. US officials believed Mehsud was likely killed in a US drone strike in northwestern Pakistan on January 14, but the Taliban denied his death and Pakistani intelligence officials said last week that he had survived. The Islamist leader, who took over leadership of the TTP last August, poured scorn on reports of his death, describing them as an "open lie and propaganda by the kuffar (non-believers)". "Inshaallah (God willing) very soon in some days or a month's time, the Muslim ummah (world) will see the fruits of most successful attacks of our fedayeen in USA," Mehsud said. He made similar remarks in an audio message in another TTP video Monday that was apparently recorded on April 19 and features Mehsud's face next to a map of the United States showing multiple explosions across the country. IntelCenter, a US-based group that monitors Islamist websites, said it believed all the TTP videos issued since the New York car bomb scare were credible. "It is our assessment that this threat is credible and that there is a high threat of further attacks like the NYC attack during the coming days and weeks ahead," it said. US officials initially dismissed the TTP claim of responsibility, which also met with scepticism in Pakistan, where the faction's capability had been seen as dented following military offensives and US drone attacks. If the claim -- made in a video broadcast on YouTube -- was authenticated, it would be the first attack by the TTP against a target in the United States. Mehsud assumed leadership of the faction, which is blamed for the deaths of thousands of people in attacks across Pakistan, after his predecessor Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in August 2009. The January US missile attack was launched after Mehsud appeared in a video alongside the Jordanian double agent who blew himself up on a US base in eastern Afghanistan in December that killed seven CIA agents. Islamabad has offered a reward of 50 million rupees (about 590,000 dollars) for information leading to the militant's capture, dead or alive. Mehsud, believed to be aged about 31, said the TTP would attack the United States "for having martyred many of our great Muslim leaders including Baitullah Mehsud and many respected brothers from Al-Qaeda", SITE reported. "Our fedayeen have penetrated the terrorist America, we will give extremely painful blows to the fanatic America." Mehsud, bearded and with long hair, also warned members of NATO and other allies to abandon the United States, telling them: "You will face even worse humiliation, destruction and defeat than America itself." A Pentagon spokesman had said last week that it was unclear if Mehsud was dead or alive, but that he was no longer running the TTP. "I certainly have seen no evidence that the person you speak of is operational today, or is executing or exerting authority over the Pakistan Taliban as he once did," Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. Rahimullah Yusufzai, one of Pakistan's most prominent experts on the tribal belt where the Taliban are holed up, dismissed the claim of the attempted New York bombing as a vain attempt at recognition. "They have the capacity to do it in Pakistan. They can do it in Afghanistan, but I doubt they are capable of doing it in the United States," he s
