<TITLE> TIB fears a toothless ACC </TITLE>

 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)The planned changes to the Anticorruption Commission law will reduce the graft-busters to a virtual toothless body, fears Transparency International, Bangladesh. At a news conference on Sunday, the Berlin-based global graft watchdog's Bangladesh chapter also urged the government to reconsider its decision to amend the law. The cabinet on Apr 26 had in principle approved amendments to the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004 which meant that the commission would be accountable to the president and the government would appoint officials. "The amendments to the Act are not consistent with the election pledges of the government," Hafizuddin Khan, chairman of the TIB trustee board said. If the proposals are implemented, the ACC would not be able to work independently anymore, which will throttle efforts to curb corruption, he said. TIB's executive director Iftekharuzzaman said that the provision that the ACC would be accountable to the president meant the government or political parties might exert influence on the graft watchdog. He urged the government to allow the ACC to be under the Supreme Judicial Council or Law Council. He also lambasted the proposed provisions that would mean secretaries to the ACC would be appointed by the government. The TIB was also critical of the provision that the ACC should take prior permission from the government to file graft cases against public servants. Iftekhar said if the government officials were kept outside the ACC purview, it would encourage corruption in the administration. Former TIB chairman Muzaffer Ahmed said government control on the ACC would turn it into a weak organisation. bdne
