 LONDON, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of political parties took to the streets on Sunday on the last few days of campaigning before Thursday's election to try to convince voters that they had the best plan to pull Britain out of its economic malaise. Weekend opinion polls had shown the opposition Conservatives gaining momentum, but the latest surveys for Monday's newspapers found no party had made a significant breakthrough. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is fighting for his political life, said a Conservative victory would mean job losses and a retreat back into recession. Conservative leader David Cameron mocked Brown as a "shrunken figure" and promised bold plans for getting Britain back to work. Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who has thrust his perennially third placed party into a pivotal position, accused the Conservatives of serving a clique of vested interests. Despite the headway made by the Conservatives, no new poll has indicated the centre-right party will win an outright majority. And Labour, which won a landslide victory under Tony Blair in 1997, could come a humiliating third place on May 6 in the popular vote behind the Liberal Democrats. But no party has clearly spelled out where and how deeply it intends to slash public spending, with deep cuts expected whoever wins. Wary of scaring voters, politicians have so far only outlined a fraction of the cuts needed to rein in a record budget deficit while Britons worry about the future of the national health service, the education system and immigration. After boom years under Blair, Britain has suffered its worst recession since World War Two as result of the global financial crisis and is stuck in an unpopular war in Afghanistan. BIG AND BOLD OR NURTURING ROOTS? The Conservatives plan 6 billion pounds ($9.22 billion) of spending cuts in an emergency budget if they gain power but Labour and the Lib Dems want to allow a tentative economic recovery to take root. "The right and the first step we will take, is we will have the biggest, the boldest, the most comprehensive programmes for getting Britain back to work any government has ever introduced," Cameron told a rally in southwest England. Brown said this would be the worst thing that could happen. "They cannot do it without making thousands of people redundant, and then the impact on the rest of the economy...is that we run the risk of going back into recession," he said. Liberal Democrat leader Clegg targeted the banks whose taxpayer-sponsored state bailouts rescued them from the 2008 financial crisis and plunged Britain deep in the red. "Never again can we allow a small clique of financiers in the city of London to hold a gun to the head of the rest of the British economy, (the Lib Dems are) going to get the banks that you own lending money to businesses and households," he said. Cameron said his party was still fighting to secure a conclusive victory and urged voters to give his party a strong mandate. "Anything else will be uncertainty or fudge or muddle," he told the rally. Opinion polls point to an inconclusive election result, or hung parliament, a result not seen in Britain since 1974. Financial markets fear a period of horse-trading to form a coalition government, or a government with a weak mandate when decisive action is needed to tackle the budget deficit. In a bad week for Labour, three newspapers withdrew their backing in the same weekend polls showed weak Labour support. Brown on Wednesday made the biggest gaffe of the election when he was unwittingly taped calling a Labour voter "bigoted" when she challenged his immigration policy. A day later, Cameron was judged to have won a televised leaders' debate. In an interview in the Observer newspaper, Brown admitted Labour was the "underdog" and on Sunday was on a whirlwind 10 stop tour around London to shore up support. "I'm fighting for my life, but i'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for the British people," he said in south London. The Lib Dems, Britain's third-largest party, have gained in popularity after Clegg's performances in a series of television debates and his support could be key in a coalition government. But there was little sign of any overtures by political leaders to their rivals. "We're talking about the future of our country. We're not talking about who's going to be the next presenter of a TV gameshow," Brown said of Clegg in an interview in the Observer. Cameron in turn launched an attack on Brown. "And what a shrunken figure Gordon Brown now cuts. Once hailed as an economic colossus and political genius, he resorts to desperate smears and hysterical scares," Cameron said in the Sunday Telegraph newspa
