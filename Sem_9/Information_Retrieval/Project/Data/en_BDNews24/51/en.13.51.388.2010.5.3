 Khulna, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  The 49 BDR members of 23 Rifles Battalion, accused in a sedition case for their involvement with the mutiny on Feb 25-26 last year, were brought to a Khulna court on Monday. Khulna's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Md Barekuzzaman after the hearing asked the investigation officer to press charges immediately following the probe. The date for next hearing was set on May 20. Former Khalishpur Police Station OC Md Qayyum Ali Sarder had lodged the case with the CMM court on May 12 last year. The investigation officer and current OC of Khalishpur station Md Abu Mokaddem Ali told bdnews24.com that the 49 BDR men were detained under Section 54. The case was later taken into congnisance on Feb 2 this year and sent to the District Judges' Court. But, the case was sent back to the CMM court due to some legal fault although Apr 21 was set for framing charges, the IO said. The acting sessions' judge Moinul Huq, regarding the return, in his order said since the mutiny trial was taking place under the BDR Act of 1952, further trial procedure should be determined after the police report. Following this order, the court on Apr 28 ordered the Khalishpur OC for further probe into the matter. bdne
