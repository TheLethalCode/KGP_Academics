 ROME, May 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- She may be turning 30 next month but Venus Williams said in Rome on Sunday that she has no intention of hanging up her racket as long as she keeps winning. The world number four and five-time Wimbledon champion has been in good form this year, winning two titles in February, reaching the Miami final in March and the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January. And ahead of the start of the Rome Open here on Monday, she said as long as she's still at the top of the women's game, she'll carry on. "Well, when I'm feeling rotten and no good at tennis then I'll say to myself 'get out of here'," she said. "But on this wave of wins there is no real need for me to think about quitting. We'll see." Venus has been a professional tennis player for 16 years, having made her tour debut back in 1994. Her first tournament victory came in 1998 while her one and only win here at the Rome Open came a year later. She has won 43 singles titles in her career including seven Grand Slams -- five Wimbledon crowns and two at the US Open -- and has often been accused of saving her best for the big ones. And she admits that somewhere in the back of her mind, she gives something extra in the Grand Slams. "Well, I try to approach every tournament the same but it probably isn't possible," she said. "I guess it's all a mental thing. Everyone definitely plays better or plays worse mentally at the big tournaments and I have been blessed enough to play a great mental game and to bring my best tennis in at the toughest time and I'm still trying to do this every day." However she insisted she is here to try to win, even if part of her aim will be to develop her clay game. "Usually when I play I want to win. I don't come and hope to win a few matches and say 'God, send your blessing down on me'. "I just get out there and I grind. With that being said, I'll be working on my game and getting ready to win a title." Meanwhile, younger sister Serena is playing her first tournament since winning the Australian Open and the world number one admitted she is just relieved to finally be able to get back on the competitive courts. "Actually I had been spending a lot of time on court up to the stage where I was saying 'not another practice session," she said. "I still haven't gone on vacation because I have been focusing on my rehab. But it's just been gym, practice and sleep. "I really felt as if I was Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. I was even teased about it because I was so frustrated and so I'm really glad to be out of the United States for a while." However, the 28-year-old, who admitted to being cheeky, said she's not expecting to be at her best. "I think when you first come back you're never really at 100 percent. At first you just have to start playing some tournaments and see how it g
