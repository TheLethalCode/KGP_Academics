 KABUL, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The governor of Kandahar on Monday played down the military side of a major planned campaign to drive the Taliban from the southern Afghan province, and said it would be halted if residents oppose it. US troops are massing in Kandahar, spiritual homeland of the Taliban, in what will be the largest offensive of the nearly nine-year-old war, expected to begin next month. US commanders and Afghan leaders have stressed the planned offensive's political aims -- to extend the reach of the Afghan state -- and have tried to play down the likelihood of heavy fighting in the city, the largest in Afghanistan's south. Speaking to reporters via video conference in Kabul from Kandahar, provincial governor Tooryalai Wesa said his authorities planned to hold meetings with residents to discuss how to resolve their issues. "I have to say it is not a military operation. No tanks, artillery, aircraft or bombings are discussed," Wesa said. "It is very much contrary to the operations we conducted in Marjah," he said, referring to a military campaign by thousands of Afghan and foreign troops in villages in neighbouring Helmand province earlier this year. "As we agreed, and as President (Hamid) Karzai said earlier, no operation will be conducted without the agreement of Kandahar's people," Wesa said. Karzai told Kandahar residents at a council meeting in April that he would call off the offensive if they opposed it. US commanders have said the remarks were not a sign that Karzai wanted to block the offensive, but that he was determined to build support for it among the population. Security in Kandahar has worsened considerably in recent weeks, with the Taliban vowing to fight against efforts to take the city. Militants have carried out bomb attacks and assassinations, prompting the United Nations to shutter its office and withdraw foreign staff. Despite commanders' determination to play down the likelihood of fighting when the operation begins in earnest next month, the chief of US Central Command, General David Petraeus, warned Kandahar residents last week to expect violence ahead. "The enemy is going to take horrific actions to disrupt the progress that Afghan and coalition civilian and military elements are working so hard to achieve," Petraeus said. "The enemy will fight back." The Kandahar operation will involve a large share of the extra 30,000 US troops being sent by President Barack Obama to Afghanistan this year in an effort to turn the tide. At least 23,000 ground troops -- half of them Afghan soldiers and police -- will be involved, including a brigade of 3,500 US troops that will escort about 6,700 Afghan police into urban areas now largely in the grip of fighters. A chief of one of Kandahar's districts, who declined to be named, said many people in the province were wary of the operation because previous military campaigns by Afghan and international troops had harmed civilians. "The people will not agree with any operation unless they feel they are protected and not bombed by NATO or America
