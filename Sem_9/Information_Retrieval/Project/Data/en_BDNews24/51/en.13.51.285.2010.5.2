 GROS ISLET, Saint Lucia, May 1 (bdnews24.com, with AFP)-- Bangladesh gave world champions Pakistan a mighty scare before going down by 21 runs in the teams' opener of World Twenty20 match at the Beausejour Stadium on Saturday. Mohammed Ashraful took away with himself the Tigers' chances as he fell in the 18th over, chasing 173 for victory. Bangladesh eventually managed 151 for 7, chasing about 20 runs more than they would have liked against a strong attack, due to poor bowling and fielding at the start although they came back strongly in the final overs. Pakistan made 172 for three off their 20 overs after winning the toss. Their imposing total was built around a huge first-wicket partnership of 142 between openers Kamran Akmal and Man of the Match Salman Butt, who both made 73. It was the third highest opening stand in all Twenty20 internationals and just shy of the tournament record posted by the West Indies duo of Chris Gayle and Devon Smith against South Africa at Johannesburg in 2007. Two quick wickets in the 16th over took steam off the chase as captain Shakib Al Hasan (47 off 31 balls) and Mahmuddullah (0) fell to Mohammed Sami, with the captain playing a tired-looking drive. Shakib's wicket proved to be the turning point while Ashraful's demise was the killer blow. The match looked all over when Bangladesh were 31 for two in the sixth over of their reply, losing Imrul Kayes for nought in the first over, and dangerman Tamim Iqbal (19). But Shakib and Ashraful would not be fazed and made their rivals sweat by unfurling some classy strokes, putting on 91 in 10 overs for the third wicket. Ashraful, whose fifty came off 38 balls, struck Pakistan captain and leg-spinner Shahid Afridi for six high over long-off and Shakib struck Hafeez for two big sixes over long-on. With five overs left, Bangladesh needed 53 runs for an improbable win. But, two balls later, Shakib holed out off Mohammad Sami to long-off. Sami then turned 122 for three into 123 for four when he had Mahmudullah caught at point. Ashraful though was undaunted driving Afridi for six and Bangladesh's target was down to 38 off 18 balls. However, his innings ended on 65 when he was caught behind by diving wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off left-arm quick Mohammad Aamer, having faced 49 balls with three sixes and six fours. Sami took three wickets for 29 runs and Aamer two for 16. The world champions' main bowlers Aamer (two for 16), Sami (three for 29) and Saeed Ajmal (one for 18) turned in great spells under pressure in the absence of fast bowler Mohammed Asif who was dropped. The win more than atoned for Pakistan's warm-up loss to Zimbabwe and set them up nicely for their Group A match on Sunday against Australia, who also lost to the Africans in the preliminaries. Akmal was dropped on 13 by Ashraful, running back at mid-on, off Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, whose four overs cost 39 runs. Fellow paceman Abdur Razzak's four overs were even more expensive, going for 41 runs and Bangladesh's spinners were unable to repair the early damage. There was little respite for Bangladesh as Pakistan, who beat Sri Lanka in last year's final at Lord's, made a strong start to their title defence. Butt's fifty took just 29 balls, with two sixes and six fours, while Akmal reached the landmark in 43 balls, with six boundaries. Shakib did though take two wickets for 27 runs with his slow left-armers. In the post-match ceremony, Shakib admitted that they did not start well with the ball , though we finished well. He, however, was sanguine about the next game against Australia, which they must win to have any chance of progressing to the next round. "We are confident about the next game. Ashraful and I played really well, and one of us should have stayed till the end. We will give our 100% the next time as well," said the Bangladesh captain. His Pakistan counterpart Afridi said,"Shakib and Ashraful worried us a bit, but we had confidence in our fast bowlers. Sami was specially very good." "It was a great performance, especially from our openers. The old ball is not easy to hit on this pitch, so I thought 170 was a very good total Pakistan have beaten their Asian rivals in all their three previous matches in this format. Bangladesh, who have now lost 11 Twenty20 internationals in a row, their last win coming in September 2007 at the inaugural World Twenty20, play Australia on May 5 in Bridge
