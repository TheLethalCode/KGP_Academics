<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, May 02 (bdnews24.com)  Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain has said the Bangabandhu Bridge, over the Jamuna river, is not under threat. He said this to journalists after a visit to the vulnerable areas of Sirajganj Sadar upazila and Sirajganj Town Protection Embankment on Sunday. He said, "Erosion in Jamuna can not be stopped without dredging." Hossain said that already one dredger has reached for pilot dredging and three more would be there within next seven days. Dredging will change the course of the river Jamuna and the town protection embankment will be saved from erosion, he said. Answering a question about a crack in the bridge, the minister said that already tender has been called for repairing the section. The minister had assured the people of Sirajganj in July last year that it would shortly start dredging the river, when about 1,000 feet of the town's embankment went under water. bdnews2
