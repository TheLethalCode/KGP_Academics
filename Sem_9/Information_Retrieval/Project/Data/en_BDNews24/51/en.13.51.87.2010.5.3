 Sirajganj, May 03 (bdnews24.com)  Sirajganj weavers have decided to launch a countrywide demonstration involving weavers from around the country. The demonstration is in protest against the high price of yarn, dye and other weaving materials. They also demand the resumption of tax-free yarn import through land ports. Prior to the start of this movement, the weavers called a press conference in Sirajganj, Narsingdi and Narayanganj. The first press conference was held in Pabna on Apr 18. According to the Handloom and Powerloom Owners' Association, they will announce a programme of blocking the Narayanganj-Chittagong, Dhaka-Sylhet, Sirajganj-Dhaka, Sirajganj-North Bengal and Pabna-Kushtia highways.. Vice president of the association M Haider Ali Mollah said a local weavers' meeting will be held at the Alhaj Siddiqui High School field under Belkuchi upazila of Sirajganj on Tuesday. The weavers of Sirajganj and neighbouring districts are expected to take part. Central president Lokman Hossain, general secretary Ayub Ali and others are set to attend the meeting. Haider Ali claimed they had wide support from the top trade bodies in apparels and textiles. Knitwear exporters (BKMEA), textile manufacturers (BTMA), garment exporters (BGMEA) and textile exporters (TEA) have already extended their support, he said. He said that several meetings with a number of ministers about the problems of the weavers pressing for resumption of imports through the land ports had taken place. "They promised to resolve the problem but no actions were taken," he added. The weavers decided to launch a movement as they are facing hard times, he said. They accuse a syndicate of spinning mill owners doubling the price of yarn in the past 7-8 months, citing the excuse of increased international price of cotton, Moreover, the price of the other materials like dye, pollex, wax, paper and others had also increased. On the other hand, the weavers are forced to sell their products at a loss Due to the continuous loss and loans piling up, many weavers have begun to get rid of their looms. bdnews24.
