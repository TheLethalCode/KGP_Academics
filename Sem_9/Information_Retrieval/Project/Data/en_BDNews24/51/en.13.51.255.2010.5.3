 KALAYA, Pakistan, 3 May (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security forces killed 16 militants in clashes on Monday in the northwestern lawless regions, government officials said. The clashes broke out near the Afghanistan border after militants ambushed a security post and patrol in Orakzai and Bajaur, respectively. Khaisat Rehman, a government official, said militants attacked a checkpost about 18 kilometres east of Kalaya, the main town of Orakzai. "The gunfight lasted for two hours and we have at least 11 militants dead," he said. Two soldiers also died in the clash. In Bajaur, a Pakistani patrol killed five militants, including a commander, an official in the region said. Pakistani forces recently stepped up assaults in Orakzai and Khyber after assaulting positions on the Afghan border and the northwestern Swat valley of al Qaeda-linked militants who want to topple the pro-U.S. government of President Asif Ali Zardari. The military says several hundred Taliban fighters have been killed in operations. There has been no independent confirmation of that. The Taliban usually contest the army's death toll figures. On Sunday, Pakistani fighter jets killed at least 19 militants in raids in Orakz
