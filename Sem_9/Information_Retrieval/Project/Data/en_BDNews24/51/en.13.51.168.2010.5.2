<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has topped David Beckham in the Sunday Times' Sport Rich List of current or retired British and Irish sportsmen and women published on Sunday. Beckham's personal wealth has been estimated at 125 million pounds (191m dollars), but Whelan, who qualifies for the list having played professionally for Blackburn, has amassed a fortune of 190m pounds (290m dollars) after setting up the JJB Sports retail chain. England star Beckham is three years into a lucrative five-year contract with the American Los Angeles Galaxy team, but is currently out of action because of an Achilles injury. Behind Whelan and Beckham, seven of the top 10 are linked to motor racing, including current Formula One world champion Jenson Button, who comes in at 10th in the overall list with 43 million pounds and top in the list of sportsmen and women aged 30 or under. McLaren team-mate Lewis Hamilton is third on 35m pounds, while England football star Wayne Rooney's wealth is estimated at 33m pounds, putting him fourth. Dr Philip Beresford, compiler of the list, said: "Motor racing has several factors that combine to make its stars highly rewarded. "There are big, often global television audiences and vast commercial interests at stake. And unlike football, you only need to pay one or two drivers per team - not 11 or more. For the best drivers that can make salaries and sponsorships huge." Sunday Times Sport Rich list top ten 1. Dave Whelan (Football) 190m pounds 2. David Beckham (Football) 125m 3.
