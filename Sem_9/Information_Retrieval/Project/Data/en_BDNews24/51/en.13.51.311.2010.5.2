 Dhka May2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain urged the government to shun the mentality of shifting blame on others. Delwar was addressing a discussion on May Day and the 31st anniversary of BNP's workers wing Jatiyabadi Sramik Dal at Mahanagar Natyamancha on Sunday. He said the government should work for the welfare of the workers shunning the habit of shifting blame on others. Delwar demanded that the third force, as the prime minister had claimed, responsible for the recent garment sector unrest, to be apprehended. He questioned, "Who are the third forces?" "Those who are destroying our garment industry must be traced out. Those who are opposed to the garment industry's growth are creating anarchy," he said. He said the prime minister should find them out rather than giving speeches. Delwar said the government came to power promising welfare of the farmers and workers but after assuming power, mills and factories are being shut down and workers are being fired. "These show that the government is not worker-friendly." The discussion chaired by Jatiyabadi Sramik Dal president Nazrul Islam Khan was also addressed among others by senior joint secretary general of BNP Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. bdn
