 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Abdul Matin, chief of the investigation agency on war crimes in the war of 1971, has denied the allegation of a government policymaker that he was an activist of an Islamist student organisation. Prime minister's advisor on education, social development and political affairs Alauddin Ahmed on Friday had alleged that Matin had run for a college election as a member of defunct student organisation Islami Chhatra Shangha, predecessor to Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat's top leaders are alleged to have perpetrated war crimes in the nation's war of independence from Pakistan when they were students. He said, "The investigating agency chief was the nominated presidential contender of a college section by Chhatra Shangha. "With him heading the agency, it is easy to conceive the future of the trial, the matter should be treated seriously," the advisor added. He also said one of the investigations agency's members had refused to start work, apparently for his lack of confidence in the agency chief. There are allegations that the Al-badr, composed of activists from Chhatra Shangha, were involved in the abduction and killing of intellectuals on Dec 14, 1971. But Matin, a former bureaucrat, on Sunday said that he had run for the vice presidency in the BM College students' union elections as an independent candidate in 1963. Denying the allegation against him, he said, "I have never been involved with any political party since my student days until now." Matin was speaking to reporters at the International Crime Tribunal office at the old High Court building on Sunday. "I contested for the vice-president position in the students' union election as an independent candidate. There was no question of having a nomination from Chhatra Shangha or any political party," he added. Matin said after completing his master's, he joined the Mymensingh Judges' Court as a civil judge at the end of 1971 considering his family's position and 'surrounding situation'. "Doing a job and being a razakar (collaborator) are not the same thing. "I was not a razakar, rather I was committed to the cause of the liberation war," the former additional secretary claimed. Asked if he would resign following the allegation, Matin said, "The government has appointed me in this position. I will decide if it wants me to." The government formed a tribunal to hold the trial of crimes against humanity on Mar 25. The seven-member investigation agency was also constituted then with Matin as its chief. bdnew
