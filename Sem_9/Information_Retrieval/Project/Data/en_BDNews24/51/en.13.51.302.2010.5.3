 BANGKOK, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said on Monday he would soon unveil a "road map" to end a two-month crisis that has killed 27 people, playing down the risk of more violence from anti-government protests. Thousands of protesters who have paralysed Bangkok showed no sign of leaving the city's main shopping district, a day after Abhisit warned of new "clashes and losses" if they remained. Speaking in parliament in Monday, Abhisit struck a more conciliatory tone, saying the government hoped to resolve the impasse through talks and that he would soon produce a plan to pull the country back from the brink of civil conflict. "I will bring a proposal which could provide a political solution or a road map," he said. "But it has to be from the opinions of every side -- not just the government, politicians, protesters and counter-protesters. It has to be a real collective solution," he added. The British-born, Oxford-educated Abhisit is under intense pressure to end the stalemate that has choked off tourism and prompted the International Crisis Group to warn Thailand could slide into an "undeclared civil war". The finance minister said last week the protests could cut growth by 2 percentage points if they continued all year. The unrest could also delay an expected interest rate rise in June, say economists, pointing to government data on Monday showing inflation slowing in April, reducing the need for a rate rise. "Our conviction in a call for a rate hike in June is being eroded as the political unrest is prolonged," said Vishnu Varathan, an economist at independent research house Forecast. Thailand's financial markets, closed for a market holiday on Monday, have underperformed regional peers since April 10, when the protest turned deadly with a gunbattle in the heart of old Bangkok that killed 25 people and wounded more than 800. Over the past month, the benchmark SET index lost 3.1 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent rise in Asia's markets outside of Japan, making Thailand Asia's poorest performer as foreign investors sold $155 million (102 million pounds) of Thai stocks. Last week the baht currency suffered its largest weekly loss since January. FORTIFIED ENCAMPMENT On Monday, thousands of the red-shirted supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra remained in their 3 sq km (1.2 sq-mile) fortified encampment, continuing to demand parliament be dissolved and an election held within three months. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told reporters the security forces could use armoured vehicles to disperse the protesters, but did not indicate when such a move might happen. "Armoured vehicles will be sent in to ensure safety for troops and police," he said. "These vehicles will allow us to move to protesters without using arms if not necessary." The mostly rural and urban poor red shirts say Abhisit lacks a popular mandate after coming to power in a controversial parliamentary vote 17 months ago and heading a coalition cobbled together with help from the military. Abhisit has rejected a red shirt proposal for an election in three months, saying he would not negotiate amid threats. He has offered to call an election in December, a year early. About 1,000 people in a new protest movement known as the "multi-coloureds" rallied in Bangkok's old quarter, urging Abhisit to end what they say are illegal red shirt protests. "If they use violence we will not reconcile with them," said multi-coloured shirt protest leader Tunl Smithisamwong. Some army commanders, including army chief Anupong Paochinda, are reluctant to use force because of the inevitable bloodshed. On some evenings, tens of thousands of protesters gather in the occupied shopping district, women and children among them. The crisis underscores a widening fault line in Thai society between the establishment -- big business, royalists, the military brass and the urban middle classes -- and the protesters who broadly back Thaksin, who lives abroad to escape a jail sentence handed down for corrupti
