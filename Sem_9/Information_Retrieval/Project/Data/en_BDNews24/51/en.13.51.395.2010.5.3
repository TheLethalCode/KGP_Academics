The organisations areRahman Shipyard and Messrs Mahin Enetrprise at Maddhyam Shonaichhari and Ambia Ship Breakers at Madambibir Haat of Sitakunda coastal area. Director Saiful Asrab of the directorate filed three separate cases against them with Sitakunda Police Station after submitting complaints to the Divisional Environment Court. Acting director of the directorate Mostafizur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the cases were filed as those organisations were operating without approval.
