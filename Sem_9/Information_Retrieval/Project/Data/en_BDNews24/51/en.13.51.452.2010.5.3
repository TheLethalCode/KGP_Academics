<TEXT>
 LIVERPOOL, May 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Carlo Ancelotti kept his feet firmly on the ground after Chelsea moved to the brink of claiming the Premier League title with a 2-0 win over Liverpool. Manchester United's 1-0 victory at Sunderland just hours after Chelsea's success at Anfield on Sunday ensured the title race will go down to the wire. But Ancelotti's team will secure their first title for four years if they defeat Wigan in next Sunday's final round of fixtures after goals by Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard swept aside weary Liverpool. "I am happy because it was a difficult game. It was the key game I think for the fight for the title and we played very well," said Ancelotti, who has now masterminded home and away league wins over Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge. "We deserved to win. We did a fantastic job because there was a lot of pressure on us in this game. But we controlled our emotions," Ancelotti added.

Benitez, who has been linked with Juventus, is due to meet the club's new chairman Martin Broughton in the next few days. The Spaniard, who celebrates his sixth anniversary at Anfield next month, waved to supporters at the end of the game, Liverpool's final home match of the season. Asked afterwards whether he could give any assurances that he will still be in charge after the summer, Benitez said: "I prefer to concentrate on the next game and I will try to see the chairman. "I have four more years on my contract and we will wait and see. "I have been talking about all the speculation for the last two or three weeks. We have another game to play and I prefer to talk about that now. "I will not talk too much about the future." Liverpool have failed to win any silverware since they won the FA Cup in 2006 and their remaining hopes of addressing that this season vanished last Thursday when they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atletico Madrid. "It has been very disappointing," added Benitez. "Everyone was expecting us to be top of the ta
