<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) --- An 18-year old corruption case against ousted military dictator H M Ershad was delayed once again on Sunday as the plaintiff did not appear before the court. The court has set Jul 8 for the next hearing. The case was filed by assistant police superintendent Ali Haider of the then Bureau of Anti-corruption on irregularities in a radar purchase from the US, against the former military strongman and four others. Rafiqul Islam, a court official, told bdnews24.com that the court summoned and issued arrest warrant against the plaintiff 15 to 16 times. The court has also ordered the inspector general of police and the director general of the Anticorruption Commission to have the plaintiff appear. It issued an arrest warrant against the plaintiff on Monday, having done the same on Feb 11 and Mar 18. Copies of the court orders were sent to the IGP and ACC office. The arrest warrant stated that this case, filed on Apr 4, 1992 with the Cantonment Police Station, was being delayed due to the absence of the plaintiff. Case documents state that Ershad, along with the four others, bought radars from the US instead of France despite a higher price, causing the state over Tk 640 million in losses. The investigators pressed charges against the five on Nov 27, 1994 and the court indicted them on Aug 12, 1995. Former president Ershad was represented by his lawyer. Among the other accused, former chief of air force, Sultan Mahmud, was present on Monday. Momtaj Uddin Ahmed, another former air force chief, also accused in the case, was absent and asked for time through his lawyer. The other two accused were not present. In his report to the court, Asaduzzaman, sub-inspector of the Ramna Police Station, stated that no one knows the address of the plaintiff and thus it was not possible to arrest him. bdnew
