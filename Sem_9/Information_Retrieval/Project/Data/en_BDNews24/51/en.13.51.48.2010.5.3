 Chittagong, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury claimed that recent allegations against him have maligned the city corporation's image The mayor made these comments at the monthly general meeting at the Thandachharhi resort on Sunday, Jahar Laal Chowdhury, a participant at the meeting, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. On Friday, 10 councillors complained about the mayor's style of administering the affairs of the city corporation at a press conference. They also protested the decision to arrange the monthly meeting at the newly built resort at Fatehabad. The resort was constructed under the initiative of the Chttagong City Corporation. They said there was an ongoing case over the resort's land with Baitus Sharf, a local organisation. They also announced that they would not join Sunday's meeting. Sunday's meeting, attended by 33 councillors, out of 55, was headed by the mayor. It was the first time ever that a monthly meeting was conducted outside the Nagar Bhaban, the city corporation headquarters. Jahar Laal, quoting the mayor, said, "There is no conflict with Baitus Sharf regarding Thandachhori." He said that it was a conspiracy that this had been made into an issue. "It has been a government land since 1941. Moreover, the High Court has recently ordered that there should be no interference," the statement said. Sunday's meeting saw 15 councillors give speeches including Sabiha Musa, Mohammad Aslam and Shahidul Alam. The 10 councillors on Friday alleged that the mayor was running the city corporation 'according to his whims'. They also questioned the mayor's role regarding the ownership and transparency of the financial statements of Bijoy TV, Mayor Hajj Kafela and Premier University. All of the 10 councillors are either current or former Awami League activists. Among them, all except Hassan Mahmud Hasni, were once known as the mayor's followers. The Awami League's Chittagong metropolitan committee is yet to be constituted because of a rift between Mohiuddin, also the city AL president, and Nurul Islam BSC, vice president and MP from Chittagong-8. bdnew
