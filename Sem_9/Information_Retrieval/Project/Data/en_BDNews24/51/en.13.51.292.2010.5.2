 Rangamati, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  The special BDR court in Rangamati will on Sunday afternoon hand down its verdict on nine riflesmen charged with mutiny. This will be the fifth court to hand down verdicts on BDR mutiny cases. Previously, verdicts have been returned following trials taking place at Satkhira, Feni, Panchagar and Thakurgaon. The nine border guards of the 12 Rifles Battalion stand accused of rebellion in solidarity with the mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in the capital on Feb 25-26 2009 which resulted in deaths of more than 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The Rangamati court was the first to begin trials for mutiny on Nov 24. In the event of a guilty verdict for rebellion, the maximum penalty is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson under BDR law. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. bd
