 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruk Khan has blamed the high cost of yarn on high international prices and local businesses exploiting this situation to make windfall profits. He also said that it was necessary to import yarn from African countries and India, and called for initiatives from both businessmen and the government. The minister was addressing a programme organised by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) on Sunday at Osmani Memorial Auditorium which gave awards to the top ten most labour-friendly knitwear factories,. The top ten companies were Abani Knitwears Ltd, Irish Fabrics Ltd, Interst of Apparels Ltd, Grameen Knitwear Ltd, Ragadi Textiles Ltd, Vieratex Ltd, Concern Ltd, Fakir Apparels Ltd, 4H Lingerie Ltd and Benetex Ltd. Khan said that there was a conspiracy responsible for the recent workers unrest and that the identities of those involved have been found out with the help of owners and workers. Legal steps will be taken against them, he said Addressing the issue of the yarn price hike, the minister said, "Prices have suddenly gone up in the international market making the market somewhat unstable." "But it is also true that some unfair businessmen are also trying to exploit the situation." The commerce minister, highlighting the necessity of good relations between workers and owners, said that the industry could not flourish without it. He also expressed hope that the new wage structure will be in place soon. bdne
