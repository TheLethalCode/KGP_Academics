<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday launched the beginning of the construction of Kuril flyover that will connect Purbachal New Town, an under-development satellite town, to the capital Dhaka. The 3.1 km flyover, scheduled to be built in two years, aims to ease traffic congestion at the Kuril intersection and on Airport Road and save commuter time. The cabinet purchase committee on Mar 1 approved the tender proposal for the flyover at an estimated cost of Tk 153 crore. The one-way flyover is to be built on 12.6 acres of land above the Joar-Sahara rail crossing. Bangladesh Railway will provide 10 acres of land and the rest will be locally acquired. It will be 6.7 to 9.7 metres wide and 14.63 metre high. A 13-km long and 300-feet wide link road is also being developed for the Purbachal project.
