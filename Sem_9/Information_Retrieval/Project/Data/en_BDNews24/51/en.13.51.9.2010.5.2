Mehnaz was arrested on Oct 24, 2009 for her alleged links to a bomb attack that took place three days earlier which left 13 people injured and is thought to have targeted ruling Awami League MP Fazle Noor Taposh. Advocate Helaluddin Mollah stood for the defendant at the court while additional attorney general MK Rahman represented the government. Taposh, also a lawyer in the Bangabandhu murder case, had filed a case with the Motijheel police on Oct 22. He accused some unidentified associates of Bangabandhu's killers for involvement in the attack. Taposh's parents, Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzu Moni, were killed in the military coup on Aug 15, 1975. Sheikh Moni was the nephew of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Police have so far arrested seven people in connection with the bomb attack on Taposh. Of them, five are related to men convicted of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman: The men who have been arrested are: Kamrul Haque Swapon, brother of Shariful Haque Dalim; Ataul Huda, brother of Bazlul Huda; Nazmul Hassan and Mahbubul Hassan Imran, sons of Lt Col Mohiuddin; Freedom Party leaders Shafiuddin Safu and Abdur Rahim; and one Sohel Rana, who is said to have threatened Taposh over phone. bdnews24.com
