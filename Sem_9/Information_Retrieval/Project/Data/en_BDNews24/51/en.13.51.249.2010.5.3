<TEXT>
 India, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday found a Pakistani man guilty of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the first verdict delivered in a case that has worsened ties between New Delhi and Islamabad. The court found Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks, guilty of charges including waging war on India and murder. Sentencing will be on Tuesday and he could now face the gallows. Here are some facts on the trial and the others accused in the attack, which killed at least 166 people. The prosecution filed a chargesheet that ran into some 11,000 pages and examined more than 650 witnesses during the trial, which lasted nearly a year in a special court in the high-security prison where Kasab was held. Kasab was charged with 86 offences, including waging war against the nation, punishable with death. India had charged 38 people in connection with the Mumbai attack, most living in Pakistan. Two Indian nationals, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, accused of being members of Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba and conducting reconnaisance in Mumbai before the attack, are also on trial. The trial had several twists and turns, including an unexpected confession by Kasab followed by a retraction, the dismissal of two defence attorneys and the shooting dead of an attorney for one of the co-accused. The badly decomposed bodies of the other nine suspected gunmen were buried in an undisclosed location in Mumbai in January by the police after Muslim clerics refused to let them be buried on their grounds. Seven members of the LeT are on trial in Pakistan for their alleged role in the attacks and Islamabad has sought the extradition of Kasab and Ansari. India has been pressing Pakistan to prosecute LeT founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, but Islamabad says New Delhi has not provided enough evidence against him. India also seeks access to a Chicago man, David Headley, who pleaded guilty to helping plan the Mumbai attack. New Delhi wants to interrogate him and try him in an Indian court. The United States has said it will allow Indian investigators to question him, but not extradite
