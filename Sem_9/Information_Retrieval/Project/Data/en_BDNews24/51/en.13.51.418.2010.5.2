 JERUSALEM, May 02 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Israel aims to start indirect peace talks with the Palestinians within days, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said on Sunday after a US-brokered plan to break the impasse won Arab League support. "From the very start we have been in favour of peace talks without preconditions and the objective is to start in the coming days, at the latest next week," Ayalon told public radio. "It is a positive development. The Arabs also want to break the deadlock," Ayalon added, referring to Saturday's Arab League decision to endorse the US initiative to restart so-called proximity talks. "There may be a ceremony, this is still not clear, but more important is the process, which will deal with the basic issues," he added. Direct talks, which were launched in the final year of president George W. Bush's administration, collapsed after Israel launched a brief offensive in the Gaza Strip in December 2008, just before President Barack Obama assumed office. In March, the Palestinians, with Arab League backing, reluctantly agreed to hold indirect US-brokered talks for a period of four months. But those plans swiftly collapsed when Israel announced during a visit by US Vice President Joe Biden that it would build 1,600 new settler homes in annexed east Jerusalem. The announcement infuriated the United States and the international community. The Cairo-based League's decision to endorse the indirect talks was taken by its committee of foreign ministers after "guarantees" from Obama in a letter to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. "Despite the lack of conviction of the Israeli side in achieving peace, the committee affirms what was agreed on the 2nd of March 2010 in regards to the time period for the indirect negotiations," an Arab League statement said. Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told a Cairo news conference on Saturday that a final decision on indirect talks with Israel would be taken by the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee. Erakat warned, however, that any Israeli construction in disputed east Jerusalem would bring an immediate halt to the process. "If they build one unit out of the 1,600, we will not go to the talks," he said. Asked in Sunday's radio interview if Israel was considering a construction freeze in east Jerusalem, Ayalon said: "On the ground, we will not prevent life from continuing because a question of principle, even of morals, is involved." Israel has welcomed the Arab League endorsement but said it awaited a formal acceptance by the Palestinians. "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praises the progress made in renewing the peace talks," his office said in a statement. "Israel is ready to negotiate with the Palestinians at any time and in any place." However, the Islamist Hamas movement which rules the Gaza Strip condemned the League's decision. "Hamas completely rejects any negotiations with the occupation," it said, calling US guarantees "a trick." On Friday, after a visit to the region by Obama's Middle East envoy George Mitchell, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she expected the Israelis and Palestinians to begin indirect talks next week. "Ultimately we want to see the parties in direct negotiations and working out all the difficult issues that they must" tackle, Clinton told reporters in Washington. But the Arab League in its Saturday statement insisted that the indirect talks should "not be immediately succeeded by direct talks." Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani told a news conference that the time period for indirect talks was two months, by when their usefulness would be assessed. "If these negotiations go well, we will extend the perio
