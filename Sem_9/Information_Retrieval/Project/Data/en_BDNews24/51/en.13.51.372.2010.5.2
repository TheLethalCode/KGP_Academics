 Dhaka May 02 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said that writing off bad debts by financial institutions will not be allowed any more. He was speaking to reporters at a 'Meet the Press' session, organised by Dhaka Reporters' Unity, on Sunday. He also added that, as an economist, he saw no benefit in allowing the chance to whiten black money. "Strict measures need to be taken for this", he added, calling for the attention of National Board of Revenue chairman. The governor suggested that strong measures were being taken to collect default loans and that currently net default loans have come down to below three percent. "The average defaulted loans are 9.2 percent," he said, stressing that strict control would soon be put in place so that this figure does not increase.
