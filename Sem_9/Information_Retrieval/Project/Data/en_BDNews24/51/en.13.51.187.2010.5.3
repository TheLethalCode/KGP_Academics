 SEOUL - SOUTH, May 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) Korea's government on Monday announced plans to spend US$7 million (S$9.6 million) developing high-performance electric motorcycles by 2013 to reduce petrol consumption and emissions. The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement a consortium led by South Korea's top motorcycle maker Daelim Motor would develop machines equivalent to 110cc petrol-powered motorcycles. It would receive government funds of 7.84 billion won for research and development over the next three years. Among other customers the new bikes would gradually replace all 12,000 conventional motorcycles operated by the post office by 2020, it said. The replacement would annually save each motorcyclist 740,000 won in fuel costs and 736 kg in carbon dioxide emissions, it said. The new bikes will travel at up to 80 kilometres per hour, cover 70 kilometres before a recharge and be able to climb a slope of up to 30 degrees, the ministry said. The country has already developed less powerful 50cc-equivalent electric motorbikes but the ministry said their performance did not satisfy users. It said it would seek to export the new electric motorbikes overseas. The ministry added that 24.14 million electric bikes were sold worldwide last year, mostly in China, and sales are likely to surpass 30 million this year
