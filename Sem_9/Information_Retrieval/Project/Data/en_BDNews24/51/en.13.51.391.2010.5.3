 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)--The cabinet has formed a high-powered committee to examine the memorandum for a final agreement on power import from India, a government spokesman said. Finance minister A M A Muhith, planning minister A K Khandaker and the prime minister's finance adviser Moshiur Rahman will examine and finalise the process of ratification of the deal, Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, said at a press briefing on Monday. The cabinet meeting in the Secretariat was presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A memorandum of understanding on power import was signed during Hasina's recent visit to India. Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, said this in a press briefing on Monday after a cabinet meeting in the secretariat. Azad said the government has decided to import power from the friendly nation to meet the demand alongside producing electricity locally. He added that a contract would soon be signed between Bangladesh Power Development Board and the National Thermal Power Corporation of India on the import. The cabinet approved the final draft of 'Bangladesh Parjatan Board Act 2010,' for the improvement of services in the tourism industry. Earlier on Dec 24, 2009, the cabinet sent back this law for amendments and final approval. The cabinet has also approved the final draft of 'Battalion Ansar (Amendment) Act 2010' to regularise the jobs of the Ansars after nine years of service, which previously was 12 years. The meeting approved the amendments to the 'Non-government Primary Teacher Welfare Trust Act 2000,' under which a teacher would be the member secretary of the welfare trust and there would be two vice-chairmen in place of one. The cabinet was also informed about employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain's visit to Lebanon to explore market there. bd
