<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Spurs will go all-out to beat Manchester City in their clash for fourth place, Harry Redknapp said, while his opposite number Roberto Mancini refused to say his job depended on a win. Mancini's City kicked Aston Villa out of the race to finish fourth in the English Premier League with a 3-1 win on Saturday while Redknapp's Tottenham beat Bolton 1-0 to set up a battle royale for the final Champions League spot. Spurs go into Wednesday's crucial clash between the pair at Eastlands with a one-point advantage although Liverpool could still spoil the party and bag fourth. "We're right there. We have two big games to come," Redknapp said. "It's a massive game and we would have taken this at the start of the season. "City are tough opposition. City's front two are a threat to anyone but we have good strikers too. "I wouldn't want to go there and be negative. We have attacking midfielders and wingers so we won't change too much." Meanwhile Mancini refused to be drawn on how the result against Spurs would affect his position. "Everyone asks me this but I don't know. It's not important for me, it's important that the squad win the next game and get the fourth position," the Italian said. "I do this job because I enjoy being a manager and enjoy football. I like this job." He added: "We must win against Tottenham, we must be strong." At Eastlands, Norway striker John Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute, beating City's emergency goalkeeper Marton Fulop. But Argentina striker Carlos Tevez converted a 41st-minute penalty and Emmanuel Adebayor put the Blues ahead two minutes later. Wales forward Craig Bellamy sealed the victory in the 89th minute. At White Hart Lane, Spurs stretched their impressive home run to eight straight wins thanks to midfielder Tom Huddlestone's stunning 22-yard strike in the 38th minute. Spurs therefore held onto fourth place on 67 points, with City one point behind them. Both have one more game after their midweek clash. Aston Villa, with one game left, are on 64 points with Liverpool, who have two matches to go, on 62. Everton blew their slim chances of grabbing seventh place and a Europa League spot with a goalless draw at the Britannia Stadium. That meant local rivals Liverpool qualified for the Europa League at least. "We are very disappointed," said Everton assistant manager Steve Round. "We are determined to be in Europe every year. That's the ambition of the club. We want to be in the Champions League, if not the Europa League. "It does test your resources but we want to be in these competitions." Portsmouth gave their fans something to cheer in their final game at Fratton Park before bowing out of the top flight with a 3-1 win over Wolves. Aruna Dindane put the hosts ahead with a 20th-minute header. Kevin Doyle equalised in the 35th minute but John Utaka put Portsmouth ahead four minutes later and Michael Brown sealed it in the 67th minute. "If anyone in the world wants a lesson about passion and commitment, then Fratton Park is the place," Pompey boss Avram Grant said. "They can take points from us, put an embargo on us, but they cannot destroy our spirit - never! "I love this club, and it will always stay in my heart, but we need to know first what the future of the club will be. My own future is not so important. "We will have to wait and see if we can be in a position to build the club again from the beginning." Birmingham City beat relegated Burnley 2-1 at St Andrews, the Clarets having now lost 17 of their 19 away league games. Burnley goalkeeper Brian Jensen scored an own goal in the 29th minute. Ecuador forward Christian Benitez doubled the Blues' lead four minutes before the break. Steven Thomson scored an 87th-minute consolation. "I want to be at the club next season, no question about that," said Burnley boss Brian Laws. "We have been preparing for some time for next season, whether we are in the Premier League or the Champions
