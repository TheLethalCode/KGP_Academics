 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US blue-chip stocks fell on Thursday as uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates hurt financial shares, while a brokerage's downgrade hit shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The Nasdaq index reversed losses, however, after government data on gross domestic product in the second quarter suggested business spending on technology was holding up. A report showing a rise in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the recent week also spurred caution, along with a warning from the chief executive of homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc that the risk of recession has grown. "The jobless claims' increasing ... is not a sign of economic strength," said Charles Campbell, senior sales trader at Miller Tabak in New York. "Given the other issues in the financial area, you need to have the consumer in the game and in order to do that they have to have jobs in order to spend." The Dow Jones industrial average was down 41.62 points, or 0.31 percent, at 13,247.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 4.79 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,458.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 6.55 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,569.71. Among financial stocks, Citigroup fell 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Wal-Mart dropped nearly 2 percent after theflyonthewall.com reported that Merrill Lynch had downgraded the stock to a "sell." Even so, continuing buzz around the expected launch of Apple Inc's newest iPod digital media players lent support to technology shares. On Wednesday a letter from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke helped a rally in stocks when he said the central bank was "prepared to act as needed" to ensure credit market troubles did not harm the economy. But on Thursday an article by Wall Street Journal Fed correspondent Greg Ip said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates, curbing investor optimism. Ara Hovnanian, chief executive of Hovnanian Enterprises, told CNBC television "clearly a rate cut would be helpful to the overall economy right now." Citigroup shares dropped to $46.31 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Wal-Mart fell to $43.37. Shares of insurer American International Group were the biggest drag on the Dow, down 0.9 percent at $65.57. Shares of diversified manufacturer General Electric, an economic bellwether, fell 0.9 percent to $38.37. But shares of Apple climbed 1.6 percent to $136.13, making the stock the biggest advancer on the Nasdaq.
