 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus Wednesday said the government was on right track toward implementing next elections. But he said: "The government should focus on the main target. It shouldn't emphasise small issues." "The government's main task is to strengthen democracy through a free and fair election. The government is going ahead in the right direction. We have to keep patience over the next 15 months so that we are not deviated from our target," Yunus told reporters in Dhaka. He was speaking to reporters after a brief ceremony of launching memorial postal stamps on him and his Grameen Bank for winning the Nobel Peace Prize last year. "The caretaker government has taken many big decisions in a short span of timein the areas where political governments failed," he said. He said all must keep their eyes on a flawless electoral roll. "A correct electoral roll is necessary for all to take part in next voting," he said. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed officially opened the stamps. Yunus' wife Afroza, his two brothers and finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam also attended the programme. bdnews24.
