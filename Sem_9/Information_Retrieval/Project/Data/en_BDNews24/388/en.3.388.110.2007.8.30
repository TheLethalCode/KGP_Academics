"New Zealand Cricket, and indirectly our professional player group, depends upon the value of the media rights associated with official international events to provide a majority of our income. "It is therefore in the best interests of New Zealand Cricket not to support unofficial events such as the ICL," Vaughan added. He said no contracted player had asked for permission to take part in the ICL competition. The rebel league was launched in May by India's Essel Group, which controls the country's biggest listed media firm, Zee Telefilms.
