 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  The verdict on former BNP lawmaker Monjurul Ahsan Munshi and his wife and two sons who face charges of illegally earning money and suppressing information about their wealth will be delivered on Sept 20. The case chargesheet, submitted on June 17, said the accused concealed the extent of their wealth to the amount of Tk 3.13 crore and earned a further Tk 5.37 crore illegally. The Anticorruption Commission's deputy assistant director Abu Saeed filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on March 27 against Munshi, his wife Majeda Ahsan and two sons Rezwanul Ahsan and Rizviul Ahsan. Judge Ashraf Hossain of Special Judge's Court-5 fixed the verdict date Wednesday following arguments from state and defence lawyers. Two separate verdicts will also be delivered on Sept 2 in cases relating to tax evasion against former minister Mirza Abbas' wife Afroza Abbas. The National Board of Revenue filed the two cases against Afroza on Aug 5 for evading tax on property worth Tk 4.67 crore and earnings of Tk 11.58 lakh. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-2 fixed the verdict date Wednesday after hearing the state's evidence. The authorities have so far been unable to trace Afroza Abbas. bdnews24
