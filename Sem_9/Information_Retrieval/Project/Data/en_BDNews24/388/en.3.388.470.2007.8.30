 SYDNEY,Thu Aug 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sydneysiders won international praise for their welcoming and friendly nature during the city's 2000 Olympics, but it seems their hospitality does not extend to the political leaders of the Asia-Pacific region. Thousands of Sydney residents plan to flee their harbour city next week, when it hosts the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit, according to travel and real estate agents. Those remaining plan to boycott the centre of the city, which will become a fortress to protect the Asia-Pacific's 21 leaders, including US President George W. Bush. "The chief difference is that the Olympics was about young people and their great achievements which made us proud, while APEC is about tired old politicians...," a disgruntled Sydney resident Richard Keyes wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald. "There will be no lingering feelgood factor, just relief when it's over," wrote Keyes. What annoys many Sydneysiders is the major security operation for APEC, which will see railway stations and roads closed and a concrete and steel wire fence virtually cutting off the harbourside end of the city, isolating the leaders in the famous Sydney Opera House. "It is going to be a damned nuisance, you'll have to produce passes to get in and out, you'll be stopped and quite possibly searched," said Sydney 2UE radio announcer Mike Carlton. "But hey we're a grown-up city, this sort of thing happens, get over it." Officials say the security operation is the biggest in the nation's history, with thousands of protesters expected to demonstrate against the war in Iraq and global warming, and have warned people to stay out of the city centre during APEC. "There is no public viewing platform top see these world leaders. If you want to see these leaders, stay at home and watch television," warned New South Wales Transport Minister John Watkins. Watkins also told people to stay away from Sydney Harbour during an APEC fireworks display. Thousands of families usually crowd the harbour foreshores during fireworks displays. In an effort to help security operations and minimise disruptions the New South Wales state government has declared a public holiday on Friday, Sept. 7 -- and thousands of residents plan to disappear for the APEC long weekend. Air New Zealand has offered "Escape APEC" packages. Travel Web site lastminute.com has promoted APEC holidays under the headline: "Bush heads to the city, the city heads to the bush". Bookings for regional holiday spots outside Sydney have risen by up to 60 percent, said Raine & Horne real estate agency. Demand for a holiday retreat from APEC has seen prices soar, with some Sydney residents paying A$2,000 (US$1,640) for three days at a beach house just north of the city. "In addition to being a great time of year to enjoy a break, it's a sure-fire way to avoid traffic snarls and reduce the risk of running into George Bush," said Angus Raine, chief executive officer for Raine & Horne. The APEC security operation has even soured some wedding celebrations and pregnancy plans in Sydney. Six couples have rescheduled their weddings at Sydney's harbourside botanic gardens, which is adjacent to the summit and will be affected by security checks and traffic restrictions. The gardens usually has 45 weddings booked for September, the start of spring and the peak wedding season, but no bride has been brave enough to book the APEC weekend for her nuptials. Some Sydney hospitals plan to postpone or cut elective surgery for five days during the APEC week, in case of an emergency, which has annoyed patients and prospective mothers. "I don't feel great about it," said Judy Hannah, who was due to have a caesarean on Sept. 6. "(My husband) thought it was ridiculous and it shouldn't be impacting on our day-to-day livin
