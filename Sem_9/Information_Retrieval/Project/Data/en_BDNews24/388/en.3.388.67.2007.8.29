 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com) Two-day foreign secretary level talks between Bangladesh and Pakistan got underway at the Padma state guesthouse in Dhaka Wednesday. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain led the eight-member Bangladeshi delegation to the fourth round of talks while his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan headed the visiting team. Officials declined to talk to the press on the conclusion of the first day's talks saying they would hold a joint-press conference at the Padma Thursday. Some of the issues discussed, according to the meeting paper, were the initiation of free trade between the two countries and launching a direct shipping line between Chittagong and Karachi. Talks were also held on the possibility of narrowing the trade gap between Bangladesh and Pakistan. The balance of trade is in Pakistan's favour. In fiscal 2005-06, Bangladesh imported Pakistani goods worth over $150 million. During the same period, Pakistan imported commodities from Bangladesh worth only $54 million. bdn
