India's only batsman with a triple-hundred in test cricket is hoping to display his touch ahead of a busy period for the national side that includes home series against Australia and Pakistan followed by the tour Down Under. Hosted by South Africa, the inaugural Twenty20 event will run from Sept. 11-24. "It is a new format for cricket and I love it," Sehwag told a news conference on Wednesday. "We played (a Twenty20 game) in South Africa last year and we beat them when I was captain. "I'm working hard on my batting and fitness," he said. "It is important for me to get back into the one-day and test side and I'm looking forward to the it."
