<TITLE> AL council without Hasina possible: Amu </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League policymaker Amir Hossain Amu Wednesday said a party council could get through although his party chief was in jail awaiting trial. "The leader's detention should not be an obstacle to convening the council," Amu told reporters at his Eskaton home in the city. Amu, known as one of the leading so-called party reformists, also said there should be no problem to sit with the Election Commission for talks on electoral reforms in absence of Sheikh Hasina. He said a big political platform like the Awami League is capable of taking part in any voting no matter what the situation was in the country. A key member of the AL's presidium, Amu also detailed his stand on some other issues. He believed the next elections would be held by the end of next year in line with the government's announcement. "I think the government is serious about holding the elections within 2008." "But no elections are possible under the emergency rule," he said. On whether he endorsed acting party chief Zillur Rahman's contention that cases filed against Hasina were baseless, Amu said, "Well, the merit of the cases will substantiate their worth, if any. Many such cases have been filed in the past against many of us, you know." He said he was all for implementation of the reforms proposed by some other influential party colleagues. "Yes, changes to the party must come when time and scope permit them." On the planned dialogue by the Election Commission with the political parties, he said: "We'll sit with the commission, if necessary. We'll surely discuss the reform issues inside the party, if necessary, and if the government does not put up any obstacles to that." "If the government thinks consultation with the political parties will help resolve any standoff, let them do that." About recent campus violence, Amu said students played a major role in Bangladesh politics in the past. "But you see, this time how was the students' cause snatched away? By who? No one desired what happened this time," said Amu. Asked to comment on the competing official versions on whether the incumbent administration was a 'military-backed national government', Amu said, "Let them clarify on their own." The senior AL leader was dismayed at the government's attitude toward Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh while swords have been brought down on two major political parties. "The government must decide about how it'll handle the case of Jamaat." Amu plans to leave Dhaka for Singapore Sunday with his ailing wife for treatment. bdnews24.
