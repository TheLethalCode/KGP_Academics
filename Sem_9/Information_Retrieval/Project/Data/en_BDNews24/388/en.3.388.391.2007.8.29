 KOLKATA, India, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Villagers in eastern India have been lining up to get their cattle photographed as part of a new scheme to stop smuggling of the animals into Bangladesh, officials said on Wednesday. "A bit strange it may sound, but the photo identity cards of animals and their owners is helping us, as well as the local police, keep a tab on illegal trade," Somesh Goyal, a top Indian Border Security Force (BSF) officer told Reuters. The export of cattle is illegal in India where the cow is considered a sacred animal by the majority Hindus. But in Bangladesh, whose large Muslim population eats beef, Indian cattle are in great demand with smugglers paying Indian villagers up to 3,000 rupees ($70) for an animal. In 2006, about 435,000 cattle were smuggled from the Indian state of West Bengal, across unmanned and riverine parts of the border and into Bangladesh, officials say. "Now, since we are armed with their photographs, the owners cannot give us any excuses," Goyal said.
