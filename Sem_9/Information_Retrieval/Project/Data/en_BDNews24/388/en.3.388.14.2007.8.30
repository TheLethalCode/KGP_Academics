 TEHRAN, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Iranian nuclear official on Thursday praised the International Atomic Energy Agency for a report issued to board members, saying it showed US charges about Iran's intentions were baseless. "We praise the International Atomic Energy Agency for its professional attitude towards this issue and we are hopeful that this attitude will continue," Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, told Iran's IRNA news agency. "This report ends all baseless accusations by the Americans regarding the separation and reprocessing of plutonium." Iran insists its atomic work is purely civilian in nature. The United States says Tehran is trying to build atomic bombs.
