 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investment bank Rothschild has been appointed to value Metronet, the troubled firm responsible for maintaining and upgrading most of London's underground transport network. "We expect the valuation to be completed by end of September," a spokeswoman for administrator Ernst & Young (E&Y) said. "Following that, the administrators will consider whether it's appropriate to invite bids for the businesses from potential purchasers." Transport for London, the parent of London Underground, said last week it had lodged a formal expression of interest with E&Y for the two Metronet companies that filed for administration and which cover three-quarters of the network. A formal offer could be made by Sept. 30, TFL said on Friday. Metronet collapsed as banks denied it access to funds amid a projected overspending of about 2 billion pounds ($4 billion). TfL has provided E&Y with a debt facility worth "hundreds of millions" of pounds to carry out Metronet's day-to-day business, E&Y administrator said at a press conference last month. TFL has also been talking to the government about sharing the costs. The administration will not lead to a liquidation or sale of assets, but is expected to include the restructuring or refinancing of debt and may also include a sale. Metronet is owned by WS Atkins, Balfour Beatty, Bombardier Transportation (the rail equipment unit of Bombardier Inc.), EDF Energy (part of EDF SA) and Thames Water. The firm is responsible under a 30-year public-private partnership (PPP) contract for the infrastructure of the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria, Waterloo & City deep Tube lines via Metronet BCV, and the Metropolitan, District, Circle, Hammersmith & City and East London sub-surface lines via Metronet SSL.
