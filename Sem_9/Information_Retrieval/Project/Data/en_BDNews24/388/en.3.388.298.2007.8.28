<TITLE> EU executive may probe Catholic Church's tax breaks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission has asked the Roman Catholic Church in Italy for information on tax breaks on its income from property, after receiving complaints that they amount to illegal state aid. "We have addressed the Italian authorities and asked them for information about this. We are talking about certain tax concessions for the Catholic Church in Italy," Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd told a news briefing on Tuesday. "We have not decided yet if an investigation will be opened. We need further information ... It would be a state aid investigation." If the Commission opened an official probe and found the Church had received aid illegally, it would be up to the Italian authorities to recover the money, Todd said. The Catholic Church in Italy benefits from a series of tax breaks, most notably on sprawling real estate holdings that it leases out. The Italian government forgoes upwards of 700 million euros in tax revenues, according to some estimates. Still, the Vatican argues such privileges are hardly unusual and centre-right lawmakers who align themselves politically with the church cried foul at the possibility of an EU investigation. "This offensive is incredible," said Maurizio Gasparri, of the centre-right National Alliance political party, accusing the EU of siding itself with an "anti-Catholic left" in Europe. "The EU must avoid serious interference, which would be intolerable." Brussels has clashed with the Roman Catholic Church in the past. In 2005 the Commission said Spain was breaking EU law by exempting the Church from value added tax on goods such as candles, pews and land for building churches. But much of the concern this time has come from inside Italy, and critics of the state's tax policy include Paolo Cento, an outspoken undersecretary at the economy ministry. Centre-left Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who was head of the European Commission until 2004, did not comment on the EU request, despite calls for him to take a stand on the issue. Prodi sought Vatican support in the past month in his campaign against rampant tax evasion in Italy. The Italian leader says one in three Italians dodge the taxman and has asked priests to preach from their pulpits that stealing from the state is a sin. The Italian church, which wields enormous power in Italian society, supported Prodi on that issue, but does not want to pay more taxes itself. "To those who put into discussion the agreement between the Holy See and Italy, it's worth taking into consideration that this has produced social peace and collaborative benefits to all the Italian people," said Giuseppe Betori, head of the Italian Conference of Roman Catholic bishops.
