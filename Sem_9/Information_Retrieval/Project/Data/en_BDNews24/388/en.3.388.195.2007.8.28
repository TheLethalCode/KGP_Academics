 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 of Britain's leading shares ended down 1.9 percent on Tuesday following a six-day run of consecutive closing highs as global credit fears weighed on bank stocks. The UK's main index ended 117.9 points lower at 6,102.2 as jittery investors returned to their trading floors after Monday's public holiday. The banking sector, most likely to be affected by a credit squeeze, accounted for about 31 negative index points. HSBC fell 1.9 percent and Lloyds TSB by 3 percent. "London equities have struggled through the first session of the week with subprime woes from across the Atlantic continuing to unsettle stocks, and the blue chip banks are amongst the worst performers," said Paul Webb, a trader at CMC Markets. But on a quiet day on the corporate and economic calendar, traders said the session was not helped by a 1 percent fall on Wall Street as data showed that U.S. home prices suffered their worst decline since at least 1987 in the second quarter. A second report showed consumer confidence fell in August to its lowest in a year. "This week is going to be packed with that type of data," said Les Ames, a trader at WH Ireland. "It's (credit worries) something that is there, and we can't get away from it ... I don't believe that we're out of the woods, but neither are we lost in the forest." "Come the back end of October, if we are still jumping and skittering every time something comes out on Wall Street, then we're in trouble." In other banking sector news, Barclays shed 3.6 percent despite denying a Financial Times report that it has several hundred million dollars of exposure to failed debt vehicles structured by its investment banking arm. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) dropped 3.1 percent. The RBS-led consortium of banks seeking to buy Dutch bank ABN AMRO is concerned Dutch regulators will impose onerous conditions on its proposed acquisition, making the deal unattractive, a source close to the consortium said on Friday. Britain's mortgage banks also dipped, with Bradford & Bingley down 5.2 percent, after JP Morgan cut its price target and said it saw the UK mortgage market at a turning point. HBOS fell by 2.3 percent, Alliance & Leicester by 3.9 percent and Northern Rock by 3.7 percent. OIL HEADS SOUTH Oil stocks fell, along with the price of London Brent,on concerns about global economic woes and as peak summer driving demand was drawing to a close. BP lost 1.9 percent, and rival Royal Dutch Shell dipped 2.4 percent. In other commodity news, base metal prices dragged, taking mining stocks into negative red territory. Lonmin led the loser's board, down 6 percent, while Kazakhmys fell 1.1 percent. Rio Tinto lost 2.8 percent after it said on Monday it had received US antitrust clearance for its $38.1 billion acquisition of Canadian aluminium maker Alcan. In other news, supermarket group J. Sainsbury dipped 2.5 percent after the Financial Times reported on Saturday that the firm had given Qatari-based investment fund Delta Two more time to boost the equity component of its 10.4 billion pound takeover bid. The Times reported on Monday that Delta Two is considering seeking informal guidance from the Office of Fair Trading on whether its plan to bid for J Sainsbury would lead to a regulatory inquiry. On the limited upside, Punch Taverns gained 0.1 percent as traders cited bid talk surrounding Britain's biggest pubs operator. "(There's) talk of a bid from Mitchells & Butlers," one dealer said. Mitchells' stock dipped 2.2 percent. Punch Taverns was not immediately available for comment, while rival Mitchells & Butlers declined comment.
