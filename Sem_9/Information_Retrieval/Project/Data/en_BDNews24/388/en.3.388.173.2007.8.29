<TITLE> Tanzania says corruption hurting public procurement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAR ES SALAAM, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Corruption is a major problem in Tanzania's procurement procedures and the government must stamp it out to provide proper services, an official from a state procurement regulator said on Wednesday. The east African country passed an anti-graft law earlier this year that gives officials powers to confiscate any property acquired through corruption. "One of the major problems with procurement ... is the issue of corruption. If we can get rid of corruption, we are likely to achieve value for money for the public," said Ramadhan Mlinga, chief executive of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). "Corruption can erode a lot of public finances. Money that was meant to be spent on infrastructure, providing some services end up in people's pockets," he told a news conference. Mlinga said the PPRA, established two years ago, was issuing standard procurement procedures to government departments for running tenders. It also had powers to investigate any irregularities. He said so far there was no information on losses resulting from embezzlement but that such data will be available once PPRA started monitoring tenders from the moment they are issued to delivery. "Actually one of the serious things is lack of information. Basically all these efforts will be able to give some correct statistics on procurement," Mlinga said. Stamping out graft has been among President Jakaya Kikwete's top priorities since he came to power in late 2005. Under Tanzania's new anti-corruption law anyone found guilty of graft through procurement could face fines of between 1.0 million shillings ($782.4) and three million, or three and five years in prison.
