 LONDON, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks reversed losses and rose by midday on Wednesday as a bounce in US stock futures eclipsed worries that the turmoil in the US subprime market poses a threat to economic growth. Gains by oil and gas producers as well as technology stocks, led by Finland's Nokia, helped offset declines in auto shares and miners. By 0825 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,491.89 points, having risen from an intraday low at 1,477.32 points. "Stocks ... are very cheap now, and that may or may not explain the latest turnaround this morning, but at some point people will start to step in," said HSBC strategist Patrik Schowitz. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has all but erased this year's gains but is still showing a 5 percent rise from the eight-month lows of mid-August. "At the moment it is actually pretty one-sided. I think people are massively overreacting to negative news, because it confirms their negative view," Schowitz said. Nokia rallied 1.8 percent, making it the top-weighted gainer on the FTSEurofirst 300, after Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said he expected a 50 percent increase in the multimedia phone market this year. Renault fell by nearly 3.5 percent after investors worried that comments from the company's chief executive on sales targets for 2009 could be interpreted as meaning the French carmaker may struggle to reach its goals. French utility Suez was among the top-weighted gainers on the FTSEurofirst, rising nearly 3 percent after Gaz de France said the ball was in Suez's court to complete a planned merger, renewing speculation that it could become a takeover target again if the merger falls through. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX was down 1 percent and France's CAC 40 was down 0.7 percent. US housing and consumer confidence data and German measures of consumer and business confidence rekindled concern that the volatility in financial markets could weigh on the broader economy. The latest victim of subprime-related trouble was Cheyne Finance Plc, a structured investment vehicle managed by British fund Cheyne Capital Management, which on Wednesday said it was seeking to restructure after the value of its investments fell enough to force it to sell assets. The deterioration in the U.S. housing market has stripped many securities backed by riskier home loans of much of their value, forcing bankruptcies among several U.S. lenders, fire sales at some funds and causing market volatility to spike. "Now the question is not so much where the losses are and how far the cancer has spread, but how much of the business and consumer economy are affected," said Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Management. Miners were the biggest drag on the FTSE 100, with Xstrata down 0.7 percent, Rio Tinto down 0.4 percent and copper miner Antofagasta down 0.8 percent even after the company posted an 8.4 percent rise in first-half profit. German engineering group Siemens fell 1.1 percent, making it the largest drag on the DAX after a brokerage cut its price targ
