 NEW YORK, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks were bruised on Tuesday by investors' deepening concerns about credit markets and the toll a slumping housing market may exact on the US economy, while Treasury bonds and the yen rose. Major US stock indexes dropped more than 1 percent as a brokerage lowered its profit forecasts for big investment banks and as renewed credit concerns hit shares of financial companies. Also, several reports fueled doubts about the outlook for the US economy. One report showed US home prices suffered their worst decline since at least 1987 in the second quarter and a second showed consumer confidence fell in August to its lowest in a year. "Deteriorating values in homes is the real problem, and also stagnating real income and the slow rate of job formation," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "Everything we've seen indicates it will slow further, reflecting contraction in financial services. My guess is we're heading for a consumer-led recession beginning in a few quarters. The consumption boom is over." The Dow Jones industrial average was down 134.37 points, or 1.01 percent, at 13,187.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 17.50 points, or 1.19 percent, at 1,449.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 31.95 points, or 1.25 percent, at 2,529.30. Global investors fear that a weakening U.S. housing market may both undermine growth and, through failed mortgages, threaten financial stability among lenders and availability of credit. Merrill Lynch lowered its recommendation for Bear Stearns Cos Inc, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Citigroup Inc, citing turbulence in the debt markets, slowing takeover activity and upheaval in the mortgage sector. European shares broke a seven-day rally on Tuesday, weighed down by financial stocks on concerns about the widening fall-out from the crisis-hit subprime mortgage market in the United States. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares unofficially ended down 1.8 percent at 1,488.92 points, having erased almost all of this year's gains. The index is still about 4 percent higher than the eight-month lows struck on Aug. 17. Tokyo shares edged down. The benchmark Nikkei average lost 13.90 points or 0.1 percent to 16,287.49, while the broad TOPIX index fell 0.2 percent to 1,584.60. Investors increasingly sought US government bonds for their relative safety. "There seems to be a bid for Treasuries, which is more to do with what is going on in the stock market of late and news of European exposure to subprime related issues," said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist for global wealth management with Morgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32 in price with its yield falling to a five-month low around 4.53 percent. A series of newspaper reports suggested some investment houses, including British bank Barclays Plc, faced hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to asset-backed securities, stoking more uncertainty over the spread of the crisis in the US mortgage sector. Barclays investment banking unit structured many of the asset-backed investment vehicles that have recently suffered steep downgrades by credit rating agencies. The bank denied the reports, which helped push its share price down nearly 4 percent. Jittery foreign exchange investors also drove the yen higher as they unwound risky carry trades, in which investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to buy a high-yielding one. The Swiss franc, another low-yielding currency, also rose while the pound slipped. The yen rose more sharply after a S&P/Case-Shiller report showed U.S. home prices had the biggest year-on-year decline in the second quarter since at least 1987. The dollar fell about 1 percent against the Japanese currency to 114.61 yen though the dollar was still off its 14-month low around 111.60 yen set earlier in August. Japan's currency has become something of a proxy recently for risk aversion -- rising as investors flee risk -- because of its role in the carry trade. The euro was trading down about 0.2 percent at $1.3623 against the dollar. US crude oil futures slipped Tuesday on weak US. data showing declining consumer confidence and home values. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX October crude was down 41 cents or 0.57 percent at $71.56 per barrel. Weaker prices for equities and base metals pushed gold futures lower in New York. Comex gold for December deliver was down 0.5 percent at $672.8 per ounce.
