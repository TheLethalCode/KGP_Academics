 KABUL, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber detonated a car packed with explosives near an entrance to the Afghan capital's airport early on Friday, killing at least one Afghan and wounding several other people, police and witnesses said. "The bomber was in a car and tried to get into the airport through an entrance under the control of ISAF," said police official Ali Shah Paktiawal, referring to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "I know that one Afghan has been killed and there are wounded people too. I do not know about ISAF casualties." The bomber crashed his car into a NATO vehicle and the explosives detonated a while later, said an Afghan soldier who witnessed the attack. The blast killed one Afghan soldier nearby, he said, but did not know whether anyone in the NATO vehicle was wounded. An ISAF spokeswoman said she had no details. It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast. Taliban insurgents have carried out numerous attacks against Afghan and Western troops in the past 19 months, the bloodiest period since the Taliban were driven from power in 2001. The last suicide attack in Kabul occurred a fortnight ago and was aimed at a NATO convoy. Three alliance soldiers were wounded. Copying Iraqi insurgents' tactics, the Taliban largely rely on suicide attacks and roadside bombs as part of their campaign against the Afghan government and foreign troops.
