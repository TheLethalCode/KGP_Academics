<TITLE> London bomb survivors begin legal fight for inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Survivors and relatives of those killed in the London bombings of July 7, 2005, began legal action on Thursday to force the government to hold an independent inquiry into the capital's worst peacetime attacks. The group argue that official accounts of the suicide bombings on London's transport system carried out by four young British Islamists that left 52 commuters dead have been insufficient, inaccurate and misleading. The 7/7 inquiry group, made up of bereaved relatives and those who escaped the bombings, argue the refusal to hold a public inquiry breaches the European Convention on Human Rights and intend to seek a judicial review of that decision. "We're submitting papers to the High Court today," said a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the group. The government has rejected demands for an independent review of the bombings, which opposition politicians have also called for, saying it would distract the already stretched security services when the country is at serious risk of attack. Britain is currently at its second highest threat level, "Severe", meaning an attack is highly likely. In June, a jeep laden with petrol canisters was rammed into Glasgow Airport, just days after two cars packed with gas canisters, petrol and nails were found in London. "As we have consistently maintained, experience has shown that a fuller public inquiry can take years and divert huge resources," a Home Office spokeswoman said earlier this month. But the 7/7 inquiry group say there are vital unanswered questions about the bombings that need to be addressed, particularly how much was known about two of the bombers, ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, before the attacks. They were photographed, recorded and followed by intelligence operatives several times in early 2004 in the company of plotters who have since been jailed for planning attacks using fertiliser-based bombs. However, the government said in the aftermath of the July 7 strikes that all the bombers were "clean skins" who had not previously crossed the authorities' radar. The group say that means an inquiry is required to determine whether the government had failed in its duty to protect life. "We would very much like answers to the questions we have raised. We don't understand why we haven't received them," Jacqui Putnam, who was on board the train blown up by Khan, told Reuters.
