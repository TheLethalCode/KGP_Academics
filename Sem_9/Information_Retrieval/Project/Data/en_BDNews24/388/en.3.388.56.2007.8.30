 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh and Pakistan Thursday underlined the need for raising two-way trade volume to $1 billion from the present $300 million a year. The Joint Economic Commission (JEC) of the two countries will meet in early 2008 in Islamabad to increase the volume of trade and commerce, according to a decision taken at the fourth foreign secretary-level meeting between Bangladesh and Pakistan in Dhaka. Pakistan is favoured by the balance of payments. In fiscal 2005-06, Bangladesh imported Pakistani goods worth over $150 million, and Pakistan imported commodities from Bangladesh worth only $54 million in the same period. The repatriation of over two lakh stranded Pakistanis remained unresolved at the meeting. "From our point of view, this matter (repatriation of stranded Pakistanis) was substantially addressed (before)," Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan told reporters at a joint press conference at the Padma state guesthouse, after conclusion of the two-day talks. "However, we will continue to look at this issue ... it should be addressed from the humanitarian point of view." bdn
