 HONG KONG, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stock markets rose on Friday as technology shares advanced following upbeat profit results from sector heavyweight Dell, while the yen edged lower ahead of a speech by US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Comments by Bernanke in a speech on "Housing and Monetary Policy" later on Friday will be closely watched by financial markets, which are already expecting the US central bank to cut interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point at its Sept. 18 meeting. "All eyes are on Bernanke for clues on the US interest rate outlook. The market could be volatile throughout today before his speech," said Kim Young-gak, a market analyst at Hyundai Securities in Seoul. Markets are also awaiting a speech by US President George W. Bush, who is expected to propose reforms on Friday intended to help homeowners with subprime mortgages to avoid default, his first public step to address a crisis that has roiled financial markets around the world. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan climbed 1.4 percent by 0406 GMT to three-week highs, while Japan's Nikkei average gained 1.9 percent. The MSCI index looked set to end higher for a second straight week. It has risen about 18 percent from a five-month trough plumbed on Aug. 17, but is still down about 7 percent from its July 24 peak. Stocks in major centres from Hong Kong to Singapore were all up more than 1 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index put on 1.2 percent. "Generally, we've had a very good reporting season so that is providing support, but I'd expect the market to remain volatile because the debt issues in the US are not going to go away," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO in Australia. Markets have been trending higher since the Fed slashed a key bank lending rate on Aug. 17 and central banks around the world injected cash into banking systems to tackle a global credit squeeze triggered by the crisis in the US subprime mortgage market. TECHS RISE Technology stocks were in the lead for a second day after Dell Inc, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, beat expectations with a 46 percent rise in quarterly profit. Shares in the PC maker's Asian suppliers such as Taiwan's Asustek Computer Inc rose. Dell's improving margin was also positive news to its Asian competitors, said Citigroup analysts. Lenovo, the world's No. 3 personal PC maker, climbed 3 percent. Expectations that Apple Inc will launch its latest iPod music players further kept the sector alight. Japanese electronics components maker TDK and Sony both advanced about 5 percent, while LG Electronics, the world's fifth-largest mobile phone maker, gained 3.4 percent. "In addition to technical moves, tech shares are being bought on the relative stable yen and the Nasdaq's advance on Thursday," said Zenshiro Mizuno, senior managing director at Marusan Securities of Japanese tech stocks. YEN SOFTER The Japanese currency eased, weighed by expectations of yen selling linked to launches of mutual funds, but remained in a relatively narrow range compared with the wild swings seen in the last few weeks. The dollar rose above 116 yen while the euro climbed towards 159 yen both up from late New York levels. The single currency was also firmer against the dollar, rising to US$1.3672 up from around US$1.3640 in late US trade. Commodity prices were subdued ahead of Bernanke's speech with spot gold trading between US$664 and US$667 an ounce, while copper futures in Shanghai and London were steady. Concerns over low oil stocks in the United States and a possible tropical storm forming in the Atlantic kept oil prices firm. US crude rose 21 cents to $73.57 a barrel, while London Brent put on 14 cents to $72.04 a barrel. Gains in stocks took a toll on demand for safe-have Japanese government bonds (JGBs), driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB up 2 basis points to 1.585 percent.
