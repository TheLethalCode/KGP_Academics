 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks rose on Wednesday, rebounding from Tuesday's sharp drop as investors exited safer investments like US Treasuries and snapped up beaten-down shares. That pushed US Treasury debt prices sharply lower as fears over recent credit problems took a back seat with major stock indexes rising more than 1 percent. The yen dropped against the euro and dollar as rising stocks were taken as a cue to slash short-term bets that the Japanese currency would strengthen. With the S&P 500 starting the day up just 1 percent year-to-date, shares looked inexpensive to some investors, while others who had been betting the market would fall reversed their short positions. "The market was clearly oversold yesterday and we're getting a rebound and some short covering. But the backdrop even amid the rally is the belief the Fed needs to do more to prevent an economic downturn," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management, in Birmingham, Alabama. After a report on tighter crude and gasoline supplies, energy stocks were higher, with Exxon Mobil Corp. up 1.6 percent to $84.32 and Chevron Corp. up 2.1 percent to $86.05. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 107.79 points, or 0.83 percent, at 13,149.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 12.93 points, or 0.90 percent, at 1,445.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 26.07 points, or 1.04 percent, at 2,526.71. With the flight to quality in reverse for now, the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was down 11/32, with the yield at 4.547 percent while the 2-year US Treasury note was down 5/32, with the yield at 4.1526 percent. The yen, which rose on Tuesday as US stocks fell, retreated as stocks moved higher. Dealers said there was an unwinding of carry trades, in which investors borrow cheaply in currencies such as the yen. The dollar was up 0.75 percent at 115.00 yen The euro gained 1 percent to 157.03 yen, and also up 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.3650. On the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX October crude was up $1.39, or 1.9 percent, at $73.12 a barrel. A government report showed US inventories of crude oil and gasoline falling by more than expected in the week ended Aug. 24. A storm in the Gulf or Mexico and refinery problems were cited as factors in the decline. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up around 0.5 percent after reversing some of the sharp losses of the previous session. Earlier, Japanese stocks hit their lowest close in a week after earlier falling by nearly 3 percent. The benchmark Nikkei average lost 274.66 points or 1.69 percent to 16,012.83. The broad TOPIX index ended down 1.7 percent at 1,557.55. Stocks of Japanese exporters fell after the losses in Wall Street stocks on Tuesday.
