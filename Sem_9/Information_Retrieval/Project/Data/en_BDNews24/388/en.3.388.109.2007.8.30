 MADRID, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla aim to turn the European Super Cup against AC Milan into a tribute to midfielder Antonio Puerta, who died on Tuesday, three days after collapsing in a league match against Getafe.

"We have been crushed by what happened but Antonio has gone and life must continue. "From now on, Sevilla will be invincible because the spirit of Antonio Puerta will be with us always. Our opponents had better start denouncing us because from now on we will be playing with 12 players." "It's true we thought about postponing the match and Milan were prepared to do so, but given the congestion in the calendar we decided that the best thing was to play the game." Sevilla headed to Monaco for Friday's match with a full squad of 24-players including fullback Daniel Alves, who has been pushing for a move away from the UEFA Cup winners.
