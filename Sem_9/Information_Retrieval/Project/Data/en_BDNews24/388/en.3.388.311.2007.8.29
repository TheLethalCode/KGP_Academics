 LONDON, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares slipped in early trade on Wednesday as global stock markets responded to worries about the US economy with a fresh spate of selling. At 0825 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.6 percent at 1,481.60 points, turning negative for the year to date. Banks and oil producers were the top-weighted losers on the pan-European index, as oil prices also slipped on economic concerns. The index lost 1.7 percent on Tuesday following news of US house price falls, weak consumer confidence data and on growing fears of banks' exposure to asset-backed securities. This snapped a seven-day rally when markets appeared to be gingerly recovering from a fall sparked by concerns about the broader impact of a crisis in risky U.S. mortgages. "Now the question is not so much where the losses are and how far the cancer has spread, but how much of the business and consumer economy are affected," said Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Management. French carmaker Renault fell 4 percent, and rival Peugeot fell 2 percent, after investors worried about growth in the sector. Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn said in Austria that if the financial crisis turned into a longer-term adjustment, it would hurt companies. Miner Anglo-American was the biggest drag on the benchmark, falling 2 percent and lead mining stocks lower as copper prices fell more than 1 percent. German engineering group Siemens fell 1.5 percent after a brokerage cut its price target. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX was down 1 percent and France's CAC 40 was down 0.7 percent. Adding to investors' worries about the impact in Europe of U.S. subprime mortgage problems, the Financial Times said a $6.6 billion investment vehicle run by Cheyne Capital, a London hedge fund, had become the latest victim of a crunch in short-term lending. "Investors will be waiting for the next announcement from the next hedge fund, to follow the line of money to see who's affected," said Stewart. The FTSEurofirst 300 index is 9.5 percent off a year high hit in mid-July but nearly 4 percent higher than a year low struck on Aug. 17, having staged a tentative recovery after the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate. Among gainers, Britain's Whitbread, owner of Premier Inn Hotels and Costa Coffee, gained 1.9 percent after posting a rise in first-half sales, and French hotels group Accor rose 2.5 percent after posting strong first-half profit and launching a 500-million-euro buyba
