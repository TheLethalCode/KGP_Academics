 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP minister Shahjahan Siraj, wife Rabeya Siraj and son Rajib Siraj were each handed down eight years in jail Wednesday for tax-dodge and concealing information about tax. Judge Shamsunnahar of Special Judge's Court-4 at the Sangsad Bhaban gave the verdict in three separate cases against the three who are on the run. Shahjahan and Rajib would have to serve five years out in prison for suppressing information about income tax under article 166 of the Income Tax Ordinance. They were fined Tk 1 lakh each and faced another six months in jail for failing to pay the fines. Each of them was jailed for three more years and slapped with Tk 1 lakh in fines, failing to pay which they will have to suffer another six months in jail. Rabeya was fined Tk 1.5 lakh and would have to suffer another nine months in jail if she did not pay the sum. The punishments of Shahjahan and Rajib will come into effect one after another, meaning they would have to spend eight years behind bars. The sentence of Rabeya who had been jailed for eight years on two counts of charges would take simultaneous effect and she would have to spend five years in prison. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) on July 16 filed 11 cases against the three for dodging income tax. The case filed against Shahjahan by NBR assistant tax commissioner Mosammat Rahima Khatun alleged he had evaded paying Tk 2.48 lakh tax by not showing Tk 9.20 lakh he spent including for the marriage ceremony of his daughter in the income tax returns in tax year 2003-04. NBR assistant tax commissioner Pratap Chandra Pal filed the tax evasion case against Rabeya Siraj, alleging she had bought 3.28 katha of land in Sutrapur in the capital valued at Tk 4.32 lakh. But she suppressed the purchase and dodged Tk 58,619 in the tax year 2006-07. The court ordered confiscation of the land. Deputy tax commissioner Abul Kalam Azad filed the tax evasion case against Rajib alleging that Rajib, a director of the Precast Concrete Industries Ltd, had spent Tk 4.33 lakh through his National Bank credit card. He did not mention the spending in his tax returns for tax year 2003-04 and evaded Tk 63,079 in taxes. The court framed charges on August 8. On August 27, the court in four separate cases of tax evasion and suppression of tax-related information jailed Rabeya for 32 years. Rabeya's five cases run a total of 40 years in jail, but she will have to serve only five years from the day she is arrested or surrenders, public prosecutor AFM Golam Fattah told bdnews24.com. Verdicts in four other cases against Rajib on similar charges are set for delivery on September 5. Shahjahan's daughter-in-law Farzana Khan was given six years' prison term on August 15 on charges of tax evasion. She is also absconding. bdnew
