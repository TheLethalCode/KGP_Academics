<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com) - As many as 161 teachers of Dhaka University Wednesday demanded that the government release detained teachers unconditionally. In a statement, they condemned the detention of five university teachers of Dhaka University and Rajshahi University. The security officials arrested the teachers in separate raids on their homes and later charged them with giving provocative statements and instigating recent campus violence that had spilled out into streets across the country. The statement termed the detention without any warrant notice and taking them into remand "sad" and "unwanted". "We are deeply concerned," the statement reads. The way the detained teachers had been handled by the security officials was a clear testimony to "human rights violations", it says. The statement brushed aside the government's claim that the teachers had backed the student protests to damage the government's image. "The teachers did not have any ill intention to unseat the government or damage its image. The teachers had just stood by the students because it was our moral duty in that particular context," the statement says. Some signatories to the statement are Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique, Abul Barkat, Syed Manzoorul Islam, Durgadas Bhattacharya, Shishir Bhattacharya, Israfil Shahin, Sadeka Halim and Sheikh Hafizur Rahman. bdnews25.com
