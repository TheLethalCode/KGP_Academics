<TITLE> Iraq's Sadr suspends activity of his militia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr suspended the activities of his feared militia on Wednesday after gunbattles killed 52 people and forced hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to flee the holy city of Kerbala. The battles in Kerbala appeared to pit Iraq's two biggest Shi'ite groups against each other -- followers of Sadr and his Mehdi Army, and the rival Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council (SIIC), whose armed wing controls police in much of the south. Sadr said the militia should suspend its activities for up to six months. It was not immediately clear what the suspension order meant, but the militia has kept a relatively low profile since the start a major US crackdown in Iraq in February. The unexpected order was read out to Reuters in a statement by a top Sadr aide. It said the militia, which has thousands of gunmen across Iraq, should suspend activities "to restructure it in a way that will preserve its principles". The aide, Hazim al-Araji, told Reuters that Sadr had ordered all his movement's offices shut for three-days of mourning following the violence in the southern city. Sadr, a youthful anti-American cleric, set up the Mehdi Army in 2003 after the US-led invasion of Iraq. A year later he led his militia in two uprisings against US forces before getting involved in mainstream politics, culminating in the key role he played in the rise to power of Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in 2006. But in a split with Maliki, Sadr withdrew his six ministers from the cabinet in April when the prime minister refused to set a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. The Pentagon in the past has called the Mehdi Army the greatest threat to peace in Iraq. Earlier, Maliki flew to Kerbala and announced his forces had restored order in the city. But the violence among Shi'ites spread overnight, with gunmen attacking SIIC offices in at least five cities and setting many of them ablaze. Maliki blamed "outlawed armed criminal gangs from the remnants of the buried Saddam regime" for the violence and sacked the army general in charge of the Kerbala command centre. "The situation in Kerbala is under control after military reinforcements arrived and police and military special forces have spread throughout the city to purge those killers and criminals," the prime minister said in a statement. Sporadic and occasionally sustained gunfire could still be heard after dawn in the city, coming from the area around the revered shrines of Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas, focal point of Shi'ite celebrations on Tuesday. Sirens of police cars and ambulances wailed and police loudspeakers ordered pilgrims out of the ancient centre of the city, 110 km (68 miles) south of Baghdad. The fighting on Tuesday killed 52 people and wounded 206, a senior security official in Baghdad said. A health official in Kerbala said 42 people had been killed and 329 wounded. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims had gathered to commemorate the 9th century birth of Imam Mohammad al-Mahdi, the last of 12 imams that Shias revere as saints. US military officials said earlier they believed Sadr was in neighbouring Iran, although his aides have insisted he was in Iraq. Analysts say Sadr does not fully control his militia and that rogue splinter groups operating in his name have their own agenda. While his ministers have left the cabinet, the cleric's political bloc holds 30 seats in parliament. It is part of the ruling Shia Alliance.
