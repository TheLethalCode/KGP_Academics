 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)  Thailand's state-owned CAT Telecom has decided to penalise Huawei Technologies up to 20 billion baht ($614.3 million), said Forbes magazine Wednesday quoting Bangkok Post. CAT has been blaming the largest Chinese telecoms equipment maker for delaying the nationwide expansion of CDMA mobile network. CAT has also threatened to take legal action against Huawei if it fails to pay the penalty by an unspecified deadline, the paper added. CAT's board will announce the exact amount of penalty on Sept 11. Huawei however claims it has successfully delivered the CDMA mobile-phone network to CAT Telecom and it is fully operational. Huawei said it had received no official notification from CAT about any penalties in relation to the CDMA network project, and that it "remained in dialogue" with CAT on this matter. CAT Telecom has bought 7.1 billion baht ($218.1 million) telecoms gear from Huawei to roll out a nationwide CDMA mobile network, according to the Bangkok Post. But Huawei has missed a Jan 26 deadline this year for delivering 800 switching and base stations in 51 provinces in the second phase of CAT's network expansion. Huawei would also be fined for the late delivery of a critical product it agreed to supply CAT Telecom as part of the overall sale package--high-speed data chipsets for video downloads on the mobile phones--even though its provision was intended as a throw-in to the deal. CAT Telecom's spokesman, Air Vice Marshal Piriya Siriboon told Bangkok Post that its directors had agreed to impose a heavy fine on Huawei and that the value of the fine would be calculated on the basis of lost business opportunities and commercial revenues as a result of the delay. The terms of CAT's contract allow it to levy a penalty of 90 million baht ($2.76 million) a day for late delivery. The dispute has been long unfolding. In its first phase of expansion, CAT complained about late delivery by Huawei but took no action. At the time, Huawei blamed unusually severe weather conditions, mainly in northern Thailand. Huawei's Asia-Pacific public relations manager, Thong Poh Wah, told Bangkok Post Monday that the company had complied with original terms in the delivery of the base stations. Huawei's PR manager has also blamed the overseas chipset supplier's belated delivery which had deferred the complimentary high-speed data solution delivery to CAT. But CAT insisted it never accepted delivery of the base stations because of product defects found by its inspectors that prevented proper connectivity until more than seven months past the deadline. It also took the view that the high-speed data chipsets, despite being offered for free, were central in its decision to award Huawei the contact against other bidders, as they allow the speedy download of television programs on mobile devices. Huawei Technologies reported US$11 billion in revenue globally in 2006, 18 percent of which or $2 billion came from the Asia Pacific region. The group expects $15 billion in revenue this year, including $2.4 billion from the region. bdn
