<TITLE> Canada to expel Sudan diplomat in tit-for-tat move </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OTTAWA, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canada will expel a Sudanese diplomat in response to Khartoum's decision last week to kick out the Canadian charge d'affaires, Ottawa said on Wednesday. Nuala Lawlor and the European Union's ambassador were ordered out for allegedly interfering in Sudan's internal affairs. Khartoum said the diplomats had sent letters to the heads of Sudan's security and intelligence services about the detention of a prominent opposition politician. "Canada considers the expulsion of our charge d'affaires to be entirely unjustified," Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said in a statement. "Wherever they are posted, Canada's diplomats will continue to work to uphold Canadian values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law," he added. The Sudanese diplomat will be expelled this Saturday. Khartoum later backed down and allowed the EU ambassador to stay until his tenure runs out next month after the union apologized. Bernier said earlier this week he would not follow suit. Sudan has regularly been criticized for its counter-insurgency campaign in the western Darfur region. Canada is a major donor of aid to Sudan.
