 WARSAW, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish prosecutors detained the sacked former interior minister on Thursday and charged him with hampering a corruption case, in a further escalation of Poland's political crisis as the country heads to an early election. Former minister Janusz Kaczmarek, fired earlier this month, has embarrassed Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski with accusations he used secret services to spy on rival politicians. Kaczmarek has denied interfering in the corruption case. The opposition and human rights groups denounced the charges against Kaczmarek as politically motivated. They said the move was an attempt by the government to muzzle critical voices and cover up abuses of power in an anti-corruption crusade ahead of a parliamentary vote next week on calling the a snap poll two years ahead of schedule. The political turmoil in the European Union member is being closely watched by other EU countries, which have already had run-ins with Prime Minister Kaczynski and his twin brother, President Lech Kaczynski. "The public perception is that the fight with corruption has intensified," Anna Urbanska, head of the Polish chapter of Transparency International, told Reuters. "But it is not a positive sign that people can be freely charged in the name of that fight. This is just spreading fear." A former police chief who served under Kaczmarek and the head of the state-owned insurance giant PZU were also charged with hampering the investigation into a leak in an anti-corruption case, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they were also seeking to detain a fourth man in the anti-corruption case, billionaire Ryszard Krauze. Opinion polls show that despite a booming economy Kaczynski's Law and Justice (PiS) party faces an uphill battle to remain in power. Its rule has been marked by conflicts with its coalition allies and rows with EU partners over issues ranging from the EU treaty to gay rights. On the home front, it has clashed with Poland's professional elites and angered many young urban voters with its socially conservative views and talk of a "moral revolution." Analysts say Law and Justice's best chance of fighting back is to re-establish its anti-corruption credentials and mobilise its rural power base where Poland's fast growth has been slower to improve living standards. Prime Minister Kaczynski played to such audience on Thursday, accusing the opposition of defending "criminals" and spreading chaos by demanding a parliamentary inquiry into the spying affair, dubbed by some commentators a "Polish Watergate". "We want a normal democratic Poland ruled by law," Kaczynski told reporters in the southern city of Lubin. "I hope public support will allow us to finish this task." He said a snap poll, which would require the consent of two-thirds of parliamentary deputies, was the best way out of the political crisis. Parliament will vote on whether to call a snap election for Oct. 21 at its session next week. The motion looks set to pass after the leftist opposition said it would also vote in favour. Financial markets have largely ignored the crisis, hoping the election will hand victory to the main opposition party, the pro-business Civic Platform, which leads in opinion polls. But shares in several firms owned by Krauze, Poland's fifth richest man with wealth estimated at 4.5 billion zlotys ($1.60 billion), fell sharply following talk about his possible detention.
