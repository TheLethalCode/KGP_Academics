 NEW DELHI, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian police released the sketch of a 25-year-old man on Wednesday who they said was a suspect in bomb blasts that killed 40 people in the southern city of Hyderabad at the weekend. The man, who wore spectacles in the sketch, was suspected in the explosion at the Lumbini amusement park in Hyderabad city during a laser light show in which nearly a dozen people were killed late on Saturday. The rest were killed by a bomb minutes later at a small but popular restaurant in the heart of the city's commercial district. Police said the sketch was based on information from one of those hurt in the attack but gave no details. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but police suspect Islamist militants in Pakistan or Bangladesh, who were also blamed for bombing a mosque in the city in May, could be responsible. Both Islamabad and Dhaka have rejected the accusation, saying Indian authorities were jumping to conclusions without evidence.
