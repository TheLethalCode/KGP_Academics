 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks climbed on Thursday, led by technology shares, which gained on a bet that business spending will support the sector's profits even as the housing slump hampers growth in other parts of the economy. The Dow and the S&P had see-sawed earlier, dropping first on news that dangerous chemicals had been discovered in a United Nations building in New York, but reversing those losses when UN officials said there was no danger. The tech advance outweighed a drag from financial shares, which fell after Lehman Brothers downgraded major investment banks and on uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Shares of Research in Motion Ltd rose more than 3 percent on renewed market speculation that Microsoft Corp could be interested in buying the BlackBerry maker. "Investors are buying into the technology sector. We've started to see a shift in investor psychology to growth stocks," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale Illinois. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 12.11 points, or 0.09 percent, at 13,301.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 2.75 points, or 0.19 percent, at 1,466.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 20.69 points, or 0.81 percent, at 2,583.85. Apple Inc. led the Nasdaq's advance with a gain of 2.5 percent to $137.47, amid continuing buzz about the expected launch of the company's newest iPod digital media players. International Business Machines Corp led the Dow's climb, with a gain of 0.9 percent to $115.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cisco Systems shares boosted the S&P 500 with a gain of 2.8 percent to $31.87. Keeping the Dow's gains in check was Wal-Mart Stores Inc, whose shares fell 1.7 percent to $43.45 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the retailer to "sell" from "neutral," saying its operating margins are likely to compress further.
