 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  The council of advisers Tuesday approved the Banking Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2007, further raising the capital base to Tk 200 crore from Tk 100 crore. The amendment goes tougher on loan defaulters, officials present at the meeting told bdnews24.com. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, attended by advisers, the cabinet secretary and other secretaries. The cabinet also approved the government's signing a memorandum of understanding with India for exports of eight million pieces of readymade garments a year and approved an amendment to the purchase of power from private companies, the Press Information Department said in a statement. No organisation will be allowed to use the name 'bank' under the Banking Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 unless approved by Bangladesh Bank. The new law, which is the amended version of the Banking Companies Act 1991, will impose strict controls on loan defaulters and their guarantors, BB officials, asking not to be named, said. "A person will be treated" as loan defaulter, if he has classified loans as defined by the central bank for the loan for "his own or interested concern", according to the new law. The amended law will also restrict the size of a board of directors to 13. The law will also help increase the jail term for illegal banking, tampering or hiding information on balance sheets or accounts. The loan defaulter will not be allowed to enjoy further loan facility from any bank or financial institution and will also be banned from national elections. The interim government approved the draft law on March 19 in principle. bdnew
