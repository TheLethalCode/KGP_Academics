<TITLE> Motorola's market share is collapsing: Gartner </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick LONDON, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/telecomtv.com) Motorola's lacklustre performance continued through its second quarter as rivals still claw away - with apparent ease and impunity  at the Chicago-headquartered handset manufacturer's market share as the company's senior executives look on like rabbits caught in the headlights, seemingly unable to do anything about the fact that they are being turned into pate. Research newly published by Gartner reveals that Motorola's market share is in danger of collapsing completely. It has declined by an incredible 7.3 per cent in just twelve months. This time last year Motorola claimed a global market share of 21.9 per cent. It is now down to 14.6 per cent and is still falling. That catastrophic decline has permitted Motorola's arch-rival Nokia to add three percentage points to its own market share that now stands at a 36.9 per cent whilst Samsung of Korea, a distant third in the world rankings a year ago, snatches second place. Gartner analyst, Carolina Milanesi, believes Motorola will not be able to regain its lost market share until next summer at the very earliest, and that the struggle will be hard, bloody and long. The research company says that a Motorola recovery might be fuelled by the intelligent and creative inventory management the company has successfully carried through over the most recent reporting quarter. During that period Motorola successfully offloaded an excess of handsets that had accrued since Q1 while Samsung's current gains could be mitigated by an inventory backlog of its own. Motorola sold 39.5 million phones in Q2 and Gartner estimates that 270.9 million handsets were sold globally in that period driven by a remarkable 41 per cent growth in the Asia Pacific region. To put that surge into perspective, the whole of the North American market grew by just seven per cent in the same period. In light of real sales figures achieved during the first half of the year, (rather than on the corporate wishful thinking exhibited in some company's forecasts) Gartner predicts that annual sales figures will peak at 1.13 billion handsets, down from an earlier forecast of 1.15 billion.
