<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  National cricketers left for Kenya Wednesday morning to take part in a four-nation tournament in preparation for the next month's ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa beginning Sept 11. The Tigers had two weeks of trainingthey spent the first week undergoing military training in Sylhet and the second mostly on practice matches. "I think our preparation for the World Cup will be complete fully through the tournament in Kenya as we played the practice matches at home among us," said captain Mohammad Ashraful at the Zia International Airport. The Tigers had to wait 45 minutes at the airport following delay of their Emirates flight. "We don't have much experience of playing Twenty20 matches, again what experiences we gathered were by playing among ourselves. "It might have been difficult for us to adopt to the inaugural version of Twenty20 World Cup had we not had the chance to play twenty20 tournament in Kenya. "I think the final preparation for the World Cup will be complete when we play Pakistan, Kenya and Uganda," said Ashraful. Bangladesh face Kenya in the opener on Sept 1 and play Pakistan on Sept 2 and Uganda on Sept 4. "We should beat Kenya and Uganda in the tournament and we can beat Pakistan if we can make most of the short duration of a twenty20 game," said the Bangladesh captain. "If we emerge champions in Kenya, it will boost our morale for the World Cup," said the 23-year old top-order batsman. The Tigers will leave Nairobi on Sept 6 and play two warm-up matches against Scotland and Kenya in Johannesburg on Sept 8 and 9. Bangladesh will start the World Cup campaign taking on the West Indies in Group A on Sept 13 before playing their last group match against hosts South Africa. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Alok Kapali, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wicketkeeper), Farhad Reza, Junaed Siddiqe, Mahmudullah Riyad, Nazimuddin, Nadif Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel and Ziaur Rahman. bd
