<TITLE> Strong investment pushes US Q2 growth up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Robust business investment helped push US second-quarter growth ahead at an upwardly revised 4 percent annual rate, the government reported on Thursday, the fastest pace since early last year but one that is unlikely to be sustained. The Commerce Department revised its estimate of gross domestic product -- the measure of total goods and services output within U.S. borders -- up from a 3.4 percent rate that it published a month ago. That was in line with Wall Street economists' forecasts and far outstripped the first quarter's anemic 0.6 percent rate of expansion. Since then, a credit squeeze that stems from rising default rates for subprime mortgages and has disrupted financial markets worldwide has caused policy-makers and analysts to scale back estimates for US growth in coming quarters. There was scant evidence of any inflation problem in the second quarter. So-called core prices that exclude food and energy items rose at a low 1.3 percent rate instead of 1.4 percent as previously thought, down from 2.4 percent in the first quarter and the lowest since a matching 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2003. Key sources of the upward revision in second-quarter growth were healthier business investment and a better trade performance than the department estimated a month ago.
