 HARARE, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Veterans of Zimbabwe's war of liberation marched on Wednesday in support of Robert Mugabe's candidacy in next year's presidential election. More than 5,000 war veterans from around the country marched in the capital's streets, temporarily disrupting traffic in a city plagued by food, fuel and foreign currency shortages and the world's highest inflation rate of over 7,000 percent. "The war veterans have a covenant with Mugabe.We will back you to the hilt," they chanted in the local Shona language. "They (West) want to take our land, no no no no, over our dead bodies." War veterans, who fought in the 1970s conflict, along with members of his now ruling ZANU-PF, occupied many white-owned farms in 2000, often with violence. There are 35,000 war veterans in Zimbabwe. Mugabe turned on Zimbabwe's white minority after voters rejected a new constitution that would have given him more power in a referendum in 2002. These days, he is pursuing a strategy of trying to draw attention away from Zimbabwe's economic crisis by blaming Britain, the United States and Australia, which have imposed sanctions, for the country's hardships, analysts say. Mugabe was elected to a third six-year term as president in 2002 but his crackdown on the opposition and journalists increased his international isolation. Zimbabwe's leading state-run Herald newspaper accused Australia on Wednesday of trying to oust Mugabe and urged the Zimbabwean government to expel Australian diplomats. Mugabe, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking another five-year term in next year's presidential election after 27 years in power. Victory would make him one of Africa's longest-serving rulers. The former Marxist guerrilla hopes to push through a bill through the ZANU-PF dominated parliament which would give him room to choose a successor if he were to retire. If passed, it would allow the 83-year-old leader to step-down mid term to allow for a dignified exit and give him an opportunity to influence Zimbabwe's future, analysts say. Mugabe also wants to give Zimbabweans a majority share of foreign companies, a move which critics say would drain what little confidence is left in the economy. The veterans sang for hours denouncing Western sanctions, which have failed to weaken Mugabe. The country's weak and divided opposition, which has failed to challenge him, hopes an economic collapse will bring Mugabe down. "We will die with our president," read one placard. Another one read: "Mugabe be our candidate for 2008".
