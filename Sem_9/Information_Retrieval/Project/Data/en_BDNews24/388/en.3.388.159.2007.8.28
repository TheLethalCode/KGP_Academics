 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  A security alert that militants of the outlawed Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh could kidnap bureaucrats to demand freedom of some of the detained operatives spiked concern among officials. The home ministry in the security alert for the Secretariat asked the bureaucrats to be cautious during their travels. A copy of the letter sent to various ministries and departments has been made available to bdnews24.com. Many of the bureaucrats expressed unease Tuesday after they received the notice, they said. The subject of the letter signed by the ministry's senior assistant secretary Abdul Baten Mian is "Security Threat-JMB". Home secretary Abdul Karim also said that they had alerted the bureaucrats. "After getting reports of possible threats, we have alerted the officials," Karim told bdnews24.com late Tuesday by phone. Naim Ahmed, commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, however said that he had no idea about the notice. "I'm not aware of it," Ahmed told bdnews24.com, also by phone. The officials in the Secretariat said Tuesday they felt the security should be heightened for them. The letter dated Aug 12 has been sent to all secretaries, including the cabinet secretary, the principal secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office, the principal staff officer of the Armed Forces Division and the secretary to the office of the president. Various ministries have issued separate notices on different dates to alert their officials after getting the home ministry's letter. "It has been learnt that the JMB members in guise of taxi drivers or with the help of the drivers are planning to kidnap high officials to bargain for the release of some JMB Shura members recently arrested by the government," the home ministry letter reads. "Their aim is to demand freedom of the JMB members by giving death threats to the officials." "To do this they (JMB members) have already started monitoring movement of some top officials," it says. The letter asked the ministries to alert their officials so that they could resort to cautious movements. Meanwhile, the officials told bdnews24.com that they lack adequate government vehicles to travel to work and return home. Some of them said they have started leaving office before schedule to reach home safely. Others who stay until the end of the office hours do not think of returning home without an office transport. Many are giving their colleagues rides home. bdnews24
