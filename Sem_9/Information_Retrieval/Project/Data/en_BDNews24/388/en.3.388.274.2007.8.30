<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of couples getting divorced in Britain has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, figures released on Thursday showed. The numbers were down 4.5 percent to 148,141 between 2005 and 2006, the Office for National Statistics said. It is the second consecutive year they have fallen, and the lowest since 1977. The number of couples formally splitting peaked in 1993, at 180,018. Numbers in England and Wales fell 6.5 percent to 132,562 last year, but rose in Scotland by 19 percent to 13,014 and in Northern Ireland by 9 percent to 2,565. The provisional divorce rate in England and Wales also fell, for a second consecutive year, by 7 percent to 12.2 for every thousand married men and women, and is at its lowest level since 1984. The overall average age at which couples divorce in England and Wales is rising, partly reflecting the trend for men and women to delay marrying. During the past 10 years, the average age at divorce for men has risen from 39.8 years to 43.4 while that for women has gone up from 37.3 to 40.9. Nearly 70 percent of all divorces in 2006 were granted to the wife, with behaviour the most common factor.
