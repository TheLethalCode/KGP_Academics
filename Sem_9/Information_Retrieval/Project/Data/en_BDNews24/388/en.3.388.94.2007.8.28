 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh all-rounders Saqib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim have been nominated for the International Cricket Council (ICC) emerging player award for this year along with other five players.

"I think Saqib will win the award if the emerging award goes to Bangladesh. He has a lot more achievements in international cricket than me. Besides, he possesses a good average with performing brilliantly in the ICC World Cup in the West Indies," said Rahim. "It is a big affair for me to be nominated emerging cricketer," Saqib told bdnews24.com in his initial reaction. "I may have a chance to win the award if my World Cup performances are considered," replied Saqib after hearing that Mushfiqur preferred him for the award.
