<TITLE> Nur needed for Darfur peace, but talks will proceed </TITLE>

 KHARTOUM, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Darfur's peace process needs rebel leader Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur's support, but his failure to participate will not halt talks to end the conflict in western Sudan, African Union envoy Salim Ahmed Salim said. Nur has refused to join the ranks of Darfur rebel commanders and groups who agreed a joint position earlier this month in Tanzania, saying he wants international troops to disarm militias to secure the region before talks with the government. "He is certainly needed in the peace process, but the peace process takes its own momentum and I would hope that Mr. Abdel Wahed becomes a part of that momentum," Salim told reporters on Tuesday after a week-long visit to Sudan. "I can't see this peace process being stopped because the people of Darfur want peace. They are really tired to go through the agonies of what they are going through now," he added. Nur commands few troops in Darfur, but enjoys huge support among the 2.5 million people who have fled their homes to camps in Darfur and across the border in Chad during 4-1/2 years of fighting. Mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003 accusing central government of marginalising the arid west. Khartoum mobilised militias, known locally as Janjaweed, to quell the revolt. An AU-mediated 2006 peace deal was signed by only one of three negotiating factions, Nur's rival Minni Arcua Minnawi. Salim said any final agreement reached in renewed peace talks needed to address Darfuris' demands that the militia be disarmed. "Whatever agreement that arrives must ... address this issue. Without addressing this issue you will still have a lot of concern, a lot of insecurity in the area," he said. He said the security situation in Darfur was "disturbing" with many complaints of insecurity and the spread of arms. Salim added last year's Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), which he helped negotiate, was a fact of life and had to be counted. But he added it could be built upon. "We are going to focus on issues of concern which have not been sufficiently addressed in the Darfur peace agreement," he said, giving the issue of compensation as an example. The DPA gave just $30 million compensation to the Darfuris. Khartoum has since agreed to pay $100 million, but the victims say it's not enough and demand individual compensation.
