 MADRID, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Emergency services evacuated 125 people from their homes in eastern Spain on Thursday as forest fires spread, whipped up by strong summer winds. The blazes started in the province of Castellon, north of Valencia, on Tuesday and have so far scorched at least 3,000 hectares, environment minister Cristina Narbona said. "We are at the mercy of the wind," an emergency services spokesman said. A preliminary police investigation found the fire was probably started accidentally by somebody working on power cables in the area. Fires razed 35,000 hectares in the Canary Islands earlier this summer, and blazes in Greece have killed 63 people. Narbona said better public awareness and cooler and damper weather than in recent years mean there had been relatively few fires in Spain this summer.
