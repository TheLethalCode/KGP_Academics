<TITLE> Responding to EC's call will show AL's goodwill: Amu </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu has said the party may sit for talks with the Election Commission to demonstrate its goodwill and spirit of cooperation. Speaking to reporters at his Eskaton home Thursday, Amu said he did not want the AL to be blamed for pushing the scheduled elections further back. "Our main goal ahead is holding a free and fair election. The latest AL council decision to lend all cooperation to the process still holds good, I believe." "I can see the EC is advancing well towards implementing its election roadmap. They didn't halt the voter list preparation activities despite the floods," he added. Asked what his stance was regarding the issue of lifting the ban on indoor politics, he said the government should return to all political parties their suspended rights to carry out full-scale political activities. "I would like to have my right to practise politics back. However, under the circumstances, relaxing the restriction on indoor politics as a first step might also be welcome," Amu said. He also emphasised that AL's progress cannot be expected to be thwarted or slowed down by resorting to arrests and oppression of any sort. "An arrest, at times, might strengthen people. I don't think political movements are necessarily weakened by arresting people," said Amu. "The AL has attained its present stature through countless arrests, oppression and repressive measures adopted by the adversaries of democracy. One might be tempted to conclude that the AL is gradually petering out, but I'm sure it'll endure the current predicament." Asked if Hasina's arrest should have been followed by political programmes in addition to the inevitable legal crusade, he said: "She is a political leader. So, undertaking political programmes too was a requirement, in my estimation." On whether he endorsed acting AL president Zillur Rahman's declaration that the party would not participate in any discussion or election unless Hasina was freed, Amu said: "I believe that Sheikh Hasina's strength lies in her party and so the AL has to be strengthened further through its continued activities." "Many are attempting to take advantage of the situation by uttering emotion-packed statements. But I'm a politician. I have to look to be in politics," he added. Asked what he thought about Hasina's arrest and Khaleda getting away scot-free so far, he said: "It must be condemned that nationally and internationally infamous graft suspects are managing to remain untouched by the caretaker government. On the other hand, Sheikh Hasina was arrested and it surely looks odd." On what he thought about an adviser's recent claim that the caretaker government is a military-backed national government, Amu said: "I consider the comment to have come straight from the horse's mouth!" Urging the government to step up measures to control prices during Ramadan, Amu said: "It looks like the businessmen are stalling a bit and watching for the government's moves. I think the caretaker government has to reassure the business community, so that they feel free and enterprising to serve the nation and carry out their vocation without any qualms." Amu said he would meet with Zillur Rahman soon, adding that the AL leadership was in good shape. bdnew
