 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday stayed the proceedings of an audit case against Khaleda Zia, tied to Dinkal Publications Ltd, and allowed the troubled company to wind up. The former prime minister, one of the directors of Dinkal, faces an order to appear in the trial court that deals with her case involving failure to submit the company's financial statements to the Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms. Earlier, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka set Sept 27 for Khaleda's appearance in court in connection with the case. But the proceedings of the case have come to a halt because of the HC order. In a statement, the authorities of Bangla-language daily Dainik Dinkal Tuesday said there was no connection between the Dinkal Publications Ltd and the newspaper. "The daily will go on," said the statement signed by managing editor Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas. On June 11, Abdul Mannan, deputy registrar of the Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms, filed the case with the trial court against 13 Dinkal directors including Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and former BNP lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu. In Monday's order for liquidation of the company, the HC asked the Dinkal directors to donate Tk 5 lakh to flood-affected people and deposit Tk 1 lakh in the Supreme Court Employees' Welfare Fund. The closure order came after former speaker Sheikh Razzak Ali and Rokonuddin Mollah, also Dinkal directors, submitted twin writ petitions to the High Court in July to wind up the company. A single-judge HC bench of Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed declared Dinkal Publications defunct after reviewing the appeals. The court said Dinkal Publications had not been working for the past eight years. "So the company should be liquidated." The court in its verdict also said the directors would submit the accounts of the company to an official liquidator in 21 days from receiving a copy of the verdict. The liquidator would turn in the details of the wealth of the company to the High Court in 60 days. In reaction to the verdict, the main counsel for the petitioners, senior advocate TH Khan said: "There is no relation between the Dinkal Publications Ltd and the daily Dinkal." "The daily will be published as usual." He said the newspaper was being published since 1991, before Dinkal Publications Ltd was set up in 1999. bdnews24.co
