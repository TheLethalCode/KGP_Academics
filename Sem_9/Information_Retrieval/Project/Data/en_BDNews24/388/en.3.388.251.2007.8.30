 BOSTON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hedge funds were responsible for 30 percent of the trading volume in US debt markets in the last year, double the 15 percent these loosely regulated portfolios generated in the previous period, a study shows. Greenwich Associates released the statistics on Thursday. The survey shows how hedge funds, often considered among the financial markets' riskiest investors, are playing an increasingly dominant role in fixed income securities, once considered one of the most conservative asset classes. Greenwich said trading volume in fixed income securities increased 10 percent to roughly $25 trillion last year. That marks a slowdown from the 20 percent to 25 percent growth rates seen in the past three years, the group found. Within debt markets, Greenwich Associates found that hedge funds make up more than 85 percent of US trading volume in distressed debt and nearly 55 percent of US trading volume in emerging market bonds.
