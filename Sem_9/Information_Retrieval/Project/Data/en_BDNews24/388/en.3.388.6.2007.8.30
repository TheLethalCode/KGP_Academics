 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com)  Economic growth appears to have slowed down, and excluding the hope of a crop bonanza after the floods, major indicators point to tension rather than relief in the near future. Economists and policy analysts attribute the situation mainly to the deterioration of business confidence against the backdrop of the government crackdown on corruption and tax evasion. They suggest measures to help businessmen regain confidence. Despite a tightening monetary stance of the central bank, inflation is on a surge threatening the purchasing capacity of the majority of the population, of which 40 percent or 56 million struggles to earn its daily bread. "Inflation must be reined in. It has already affected the majority of the population," said Zaid Bakht, a research director at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. Decline in overall farm output and rise in global commodity prices has also affected price levels. An about Tk 6.0 billion loss in agricultural output due to the flood has further worsened the situation. M Asaduzzaman, another BIDS research director, suggested rehabilitation support to agriculture following the flood to control further price hike. Improvement in supply of essential commodities is also needed, he said. Growth in exports, the country's main earning source, slumped substantially, indicating a possible fall in employment generation. "It may influence depreciation of the taka against the dollar and up prices of import- led commodities. The fall in exports may also hurt employment," a central bank analyst, who preferred not to be named, said. The growth of exports fell 5.94 percentage points to 15.69 percent in the fiscal 2006-07 from 21.63 percent a year back. Decline in exports of tea, jute and jute products contributed mainly to the fall, according to official statistics. The price fall of export items in the global market and a narrow export basket mainly contributed to the fall, analysts said. The relief, the BB official said, was the moderate reserves with the Bangladesh Bank, a steady increase in remittance inflows, rise in imports of consumer goods and anticipation of better production of the aman crop. Growth in deposits and savings certificate sales also descended to 17.09 percent and 9.59 percent in the July-June period of the 2006-07 fiscal from 18.42 percent and 35.55 percent a year ago. Inflation, which stood at 9.20 percent in June from 8.02 percent in May on a month-to month basis, was a disincentive for the depositors as it had already sent the real interest rate on deposits into negative territory and hampered deposit growth. "Banks have surplus funds now. But if deposit growth drops, it may affect banks lending capacity and thereby investment," the BB official said. The anticorruption and tax evasion drive as well as 10 percent tax has affected investment against savings certificates. It may encourage increased government borrowing from the banking system, the BB official said. The drive against corruption and tax evasion had also affected business confidence, analysts said. The private sector credit growth, an indicator of investment, also dropped to 15.12 percent in the last fiscal year from 18.27 percent the preceding year due to deterioration of business confidence, although banks sat with Tk 142.79 billion in excess fund, according to the BB. "Businessmen should be allowed to manage their money with ease and make their own decisions," says Mamun Rashid, a banker who sees the economy in a correctional phase and showing some symptoms of slowing down especially on the investment sideboth domestic and foreign. "It is a politically-driven economic correction. If it is short lived, it is okay. But if it is long standing, it will be a painstaking journey," he said. Yawer Sayeed, a senior stock market analyst at AIMS of Bangladesh said, "A realignment of business and trade is necessary to come out of the situation." bd
