<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's eyes glinted Wednesday seeing her relatives, but teared when the picture of her 1 -month old grandson was given to her. She wept holding the photo of the newborn son of her Washington-based daughter Saima Wazed Putul to her chest, the relatives said. Hasina's aunt Alima Sarwar Lulu, cousins Sheikh Mili and Firoza Begum and niece Mita Chowdhury went to see the Awami League chief in the special jail at the parliament complex at around 4pm. They stayed there for one and a half hours. Lulu and Mili later told journalists Hasina was mentally strong. But she was missing not talking to younger sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy and daughter Putul by telephone. "We didn't talk politics in the entire time we spent with her. We had chats about family matters," Lulu said. "We had taken along Putul's one and a half-month old son's picture. She cried for quite sometime pressing it to her chest." The relatives said Hasina feared that she might not get justice and that she had sought blessings of the people. Mili said they had taken along some dry food including halua for Hasina. bdnews24.com/l
