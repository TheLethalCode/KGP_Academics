<TITLE> Egyptian movement seeks to hold up privatisation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian former public-sector manager says a movement he began earlier this year is mobilising opposition to the government's privatisation programme and has started to have some effect on the pace of sales. Yehia Hussein Abdel Hady told Reuters in an interview that his campaign group, called "No To Selling Egypt", wants all sales of state assets halted, on the grounds that the government cannot be trusted to dispose of companies properly and has seriously undersold some state assets. "We are not against all privatisation but we are against privatisation by this government," he said. "We want to stop any selling until a new, democratic regime comes ... that can ask the people what kind of privatisation programme they prefer," added Abdel Hady, who ran a state-owned retail company until, he says, his views led to demotion. Privatisation has been central to President Hosni Mubarak's economic liberalisation, and includes the sale of hundreds of companies, among them one of the country's biggest banks. Supporters of privatisation say it has stimulated economic growth, now running at about 7 percent a year, helped lure foreign investment and reduce the budget deficit. But many Egyptians say they have not felt the benefits or fear it could cost them their jobs. The focus for the moment is on Banque du Caire, one of the three big state banks and an early target for privatisation. The movement says it has forced the government to backtrack on the size of the stake it will sell in the bank, which Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif expects to fetch more than $1.6 billion. The government initially said it planned to sell 80 percent of the bank. Then it said the stake could be 60 percent and now it says the stake has not been decided. While the movement has little chance of preventing the sale, it has been gaining support and publicity over the past few months and reflects public suspicion of a government seen as dominated by business interests. "We may not stop the sale but we have succeeded in changing the plan," Abdel Hady said. "At least now everyone in Egypt is talking about the sale of Banque du Caire." Abdel Hady said his movement groups activists from across Egypt's political spectrum, including politicians ranging from the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood to the liberal nationalist Wafd Party. "Formally we have about 20 seats in parliament but the rest of the Muslim Brotherhood in parliament is with us as well," he said. Brotherhood members have 88 seats in parliament. "People take off their party affiliation in this movement." Abdel Hady says his is a popular movement similar to Kefaya, the opposition group which came to prominence in 2005 by opposing a fifth six-year term for Mubarak. Opponents of selling Banque du Caire have staged at least one street demonstration but -- like Kefaya's demonstrations in 2005 -- it failed to draw large crowds and the protesters were greatly outnumbered by the cordon of riot police. Some opposition to privatisation, especially among the Wafd party, stems from a desire to keep state companies, many of them nationalised in the 1950s, out of foreign hands. But Abdel Hady says "No To Selling Egypt" opposes all sales of state firms by the present government, even to Egyptians. The movement is now trying to build on recent labour unrest to expand its base beyond a small elite, Abdel Hady said. Thousands of workers have gone on strike over the past year, usually demanding wage rises and in some cases protesting the possibility of job cuts from privatisation, he said. "This year there have been many strikes and many of the labour leaders are with us," he said. "It's not the only reason, but the privatisation has helped cause some of these strikes." Abdel Hady won prominence last year by accusing the government of selling national department store chain Omar Effendi at a price some 500 million Egyptian pounds ($88 million) below its own initial valuation. Investment Minister Mahmoud Mohieldin disputed his figures and said the government got the best deal available when it sold 90 percent of Omar Effendi for 589.5 million poun
