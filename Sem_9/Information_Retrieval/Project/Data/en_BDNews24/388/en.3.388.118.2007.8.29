 OTTAWA, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Canadian soldier based in the Afghan capital Kabul died of a gunshot wound on Wednesday after he was found injured in his room, the defense ministry said. The soldier, serving with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, was the 70th member of the armed forces to die since Ottawa deployed troops in late 2002. Canada has a 2,500-strong mission in the southern city of Kandahar. The defense ministry said in a statement that enemy action had been ruled out.
