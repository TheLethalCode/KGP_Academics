 LOS ANGELES, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's David Beckham will undergo a scan after he suffered a knee injury playing for LA Galaxy on Wednesday, casting doubt on his fitness ahead of next month's Euro 2008 qualifiers. Beckham, who is hoping to take part in England's qualifiers against Israel and Russia in September, was substituted in the 33rd minute of the Superliga final against Mexican team Pachuca after a challenge with Fernando Salazar. It is the latest injury setback for the midfielder, whose two months in the U.S. have been hampered by a nagging ankle problem. "It's just gone from one thing to another thing. Maybe it is a sign to give it a rest, get it right and not come back until it is right," Beckham told reporters after the game which Galaxy lost on penalties. The former England captain fell badly and after limping off, he received treatment to his right knee and watched the rest of the match from the bench. A Galaxy spokesman said Beckham had suffered a sprain to his right knee while the midfielder indicated the injury could be more serious. "It doesn't feel good. With a ligament strain it is four-to-six weeks. We will have to wait and see," he said before refusing to rule himself out of Galaxy's match away to Real Salt Lake on Saturday. "I'm going to have a scan, at the end of the day, if the scan comes back tomorrow and it is not as bad as it was then you know maybe I've got a chance to play (on Saturday)." LIMPING OFF The 32-year-old midfielder missed Sunday's Major League Soccer match against Colorado Rapids after limping off in Thursday's game against Chivas USA. Beckham had lined up against Chivas the day after playing a full 90 minutes in England's friendly against Germany in London. England will play Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel on Sept. 8 and Russia four days later. Beckham's injury problems began when twisted his ankle playing for his country against Estonia in June and aggravated it when playing for Real Madrid 11 days later when the Spanish giants clinched the league title. Galaxy's disappointing season continued with defeat in Wednesday's game, the final of a competition involving eight teams -- four from the U.S. and four from Mexico. Pachuca took the lead in the 28th minute when Argentine winger Christian Giminez slipped the ball across the area only for Galaxy defender Peter Vagenas to turn it into his own net. With a Mexican victory looking certain, LA took the game into extra-time when Chris Klein produced a spectacular overhead kick after Mike Randolph's header rattled the crossbar. With no goals in extra-time, the match went to a penalty shootout, which Pachuca won 4-3 after Vagenas, Landon Donovan and Portuguese defender Abel Xavier missed spot kicks for LA
