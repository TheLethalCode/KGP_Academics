<TITLE> Lebanon's Lahoud says will install govt if no deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's pro-Syrian president said on Thursday he would appoint an interim government headed by the army chief if rival Lebanese leaders cannot agree on a new head of state before his term expires in November. President Emile Lahoud's remark raised the stakes in a deep political conflict which pits the anti-Syrian Beirut government, backed by the United States, against an opposition coalition including factions allied to Damascus and Tehran. Such a step by Lahoud, who has already hinted he could appoint a new cabinet, would result in two governments, assuming army commander Michel Suleiman were to accept the job, analysts said. There was no immediate word from Suleiman. "The government which is still standing and which is unconstitutional ... cannot assume power if the election of a president of the republic is not possible," said Lahoud, in reference to the cabinet of Prime Minister Fouad Sinora. A president must be elected by parliament with the two-thirds quorum required for the vote, Lahoud said. "If that doesn't happen ... the leader of the army will come for an interim period as head of the government, with a clear mission to lay down a (parliamentary) electoral law acceptable to all," he said in a statement.
