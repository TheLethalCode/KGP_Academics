<TITLE> UK rail watchdog warns on Q1 track failure, damage </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's rail watchdog criticised the performance of Network Rail on Wednesday after train delays caused by problems with its rail infrastructure rose 5 percent in the first quarter. The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) highlighted poor performance by Network Rail on the western route and warned heavier commuter trains in southern England were damaging the track there. In the first quarter, 18 rails were broken, compared to 24 a year earlier, but other track defects led to a 15 percent increase in infrastructure failures overall. "Network Rail attributes the increase in rail defects in part to the impact of new trains in the south of England, arising from the higher contact stresses from heavier trains with stiffer suspension," said the ORR. ORR performance director Michael Lee said the damage could not be compared to that which caused a train crash in Hatfield north of London seven years ago that killed four people and injured 30. "What they're doing is monitoring the problems before they reach the scale of that which caused Hatfield," he told reporters. The ORR said it expected Network Rail to improve performance after a disappointing quarter on its western route out of London's Paddington station towards Wales and southwest England, a train route mainly operated by First Group's First Great Western. "If we conclude that Network Rail could and should have been doing more than they have been, we will take enforcement action," it said. In a statement, Network Rail said: "Network Rail fully recognises that the massive leaps it has made in improving train performance over the past five years has slowed." ORR's enforcement action could include fining Network Rail, which can in turn impact the bonuses of the group's directors at the end of the year. In May, the company cut bonuses after a derailment at Grayrigg in northern England in February which killed an elderly woman and seriously injured several other passeng
