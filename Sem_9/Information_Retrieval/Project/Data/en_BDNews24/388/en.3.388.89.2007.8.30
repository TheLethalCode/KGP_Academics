<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com)  Two arrested teachers of Dhaka University Thursday expressed sorrow over the "attitude shown to the army" during student protests on campus and sought forgiveness from all in the armyfrom a soldier up to the army chief. Professor Anwar Hossain claimed that the agitated students had attacked security officials and uniformed army personnel, hurting the dignity of the Armed Forces as a whole. "They felt insulted," he said expecting that all misunderstandings regarding the issue would end following his remarks. "It's an unwarranted incident. Today's military is not the same as the Pakistani army in 1971. I'm sorry about the attitude shown to the army," Hossain told reporters, just outside the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhakaa few minutes before he was taken inside for a hearing. "Our army has a glorious history. They are symbols of sovereignty, security and unity. We understand it very easily that how they would feel and what their reactions would be if somebody attacks the army in uniform," he said. "We also feel dishonoured seeing the insult meted out to an army man in uniform," Hossain said. "The attacks on the army meant attacks on the sovereignty of the country. I am deeply sorry for the attacks that made the army feel dishonoured and dented their self-respect." "As the general secretary of DUTA and as a guardian of students, I apologise to all, from a respectable soldier to the army chief. There is no shame in seeking forgiveness. It brings glory. I think what I am saying will console the army in their grievances and sadness." Security personnel picked up Hossain and colleague Harun-or-Rashid, dean of social sciences, in separate raids on their university homes a week ago following the spread of student protests. Rashid also regretted the Dhaka University incident. "The attacks on the army in uniform are really unfortunate. I seek forgiveness from all in the armyfrom the army chief to the soldier on behalf of students." bdnews
