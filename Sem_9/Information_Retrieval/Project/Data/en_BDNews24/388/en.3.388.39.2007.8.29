<TITLE> EU Commission backs compromise in China lamp row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission opted for a compromise to end a row over anti-dumping duties on Chinese energy-saving lightbulbs on Wednesday, proposing to extend them for one more year rather than scrap them right away. In a case seen by trade experts as a test of the European Union's openness to cheap imports from Asia, the bloc's trade chief Peter Mandelson had pushed to axe the duties immediately. He had the backing of most producers in Europe, including Dutch electronics group Philips, which import large amounts of the bulbs from China. Environmentalists argued that extending the duties, which add up to 66 percent on the price of the bulbs, flew in the face of the EU's claim to lead the global fight against climate change. But Mandelson ran into opposition from Germany and its EU Enterprise Commissioner Guenter Verheugen who expressed concern that axing the duties would cost jobs at Osram, part of Germany's Siemens group. The one-year extension backed by the EU Commission on Wednesday is shorter than the usual five-year period for anti-dumping duties that was originally sought by Germany. The duties were introduced in 2001. The case again highlights the tensions within the 27-nation bloc between companies wanting cheap imports and those that say they are being hurt by unfair trade practices. European Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger told reporters the one-year extension would allow "a soft transition" for the European industry. But the proposal was lambasted by the environmental group WWF as a "severe contradiction" in EU policies. "On the one hand, Europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products...," WWF trade advisor Eivind Hoff said. The Commission proposal will now be put to EU member states for approval. Trade experts have said the lightbulbs issue represents a test case because Mandelson seems to have given more weight than in the past to interests of EU companies that produce or source goods in China.
