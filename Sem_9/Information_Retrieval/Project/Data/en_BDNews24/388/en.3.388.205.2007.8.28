 ABIDJAN, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Ivory Coast discovered 6.6 kg of heroin inside a piston for a lorry engine sent to the West African state by a courier from Pakistan, an official said on Tuesday.

We had no difficulty finding the addressee," a senior police officer told Reuters, asking not to be named.
