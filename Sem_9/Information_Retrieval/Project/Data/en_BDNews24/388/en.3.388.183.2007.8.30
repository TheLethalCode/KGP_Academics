<TITLE> Robust mortgage data rekindle UK rate hike talk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Banks approved thousands more mortgages for new homes than analysts had expected in July, suggesting any housing market slowdown will be gradual and rekindling talk that British interest rates may yet rise again. Consumer credit rose at its fastest since last November and house price inflation also remained firm, but there are signs higher rates are starting to weigh on spending with the latest report showing the weakest retail sales growth since late last year. The robust housing market and lending figures boosted the pound as they rekindled speculation that the Bank of England might deliver another interest rate hike before the year is out. The BoE had signalled earlier this month that interest rates might have to rise to 6 percent to control inflation over the medium term, but recent turbulence on financial markets due to poor global credit conditions had all but silenced the hawks. "Housing market activity has held up very well in the face of the five rate hikes seen over the past year," said Peter Newland, an economist at Lehman Brothers. "The outlook remains very uncertain but our best guess at the current juncture is that the impact on the real economy (from the credit crunch) will prove to be limited and the Bank of England will see cause to hike rates one more time." BoE figures showed mortgage approvals held steady in July at 115,000 after an upwardly revised June figure, confounding analysts' forecasts for a fall to 110,000 and indicating house price growth is likely to remain underpinned for a while yet. The Nationwide building society said house prices rose 0.6 percent in August, recovering from July's 0.1 percent gain which had been the weakest rise since April 2006. Annual house price inflation eased as expected, however, to 9.6 percent from 9.9 percent in July. "Any further moderation in house price inflation is likely to be a very gradual process, rather than an abrupt downturn," said George Johns, an economist at Barclays Capital. The BoE said consumer credit rose by more than 1 billion pounds in July, above forecasts for a 0.875 billion gain. A confirmation of sustained rapid growth in broad money supply will also cause policymakers some concern as they fret that too much cash in the financial system will fuel inflation over the longer term. The BoE left its final reading of broad money supply growth unrevised at a robust 13.0 percent on the year. However, there were signs that the high street is feeling the pinch as interest rates rise and also some relief for members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee who have expressed concern about companies' pricing power. British retail sales growth eased this month to its weakest pace since last November, the Confederation of British Industry said, and retailers' reported prices and their expectations for selling prices fell sharply. "The falls in both the reported and expected prices balances are good news from an inflationary point of view, although the MPC will want to see prices balances ease across all the surveys before it starts to relax about firms' pricing power," said Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics. Some economists say the impact of rising interest rates is also bound to hit the housing market, perhaps suddenly, making another hike in borrowing costs unlikely given ongoing worries about global credit and liquidity conditions. "For now, mortgage approvals continue to defy gravity," said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas. "A correction is long overdue."
