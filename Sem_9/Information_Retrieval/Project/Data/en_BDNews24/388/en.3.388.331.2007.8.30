<TITLE> Asia hedge funds' simplicity may be saving grace </TITLE>

 SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Asia-Pacific's hedge fund industry, long seen as less sophisticated than its US and European peers, is about to find out its focus on equities rather than complicated debt instruments may be its saving grace. Even though a fund run by Australia's Basis Capital became the region's first major victim of the global credit squeeze, the dearth of Asia-Pacific funds investing in credit markets means it should suffer less than global peers. The Basis Capital vehicle filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection after being slammed by the losses on its investments in complex collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). It joined the ranks of other high profile flameouts caused by credit market turmoil, including Sowood Capital and funds run by Bear Stearns Many firms have been stung because of the use of high levels of leverage, or borrowing, that painfully amplified losses when bets went bad. The credit market turmoil, triggered by a meltdown in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, has also caused problems at funds run by Australian peers Macquarie and Absolute Capital. But fund executives and analysts noted that these types of debt-focused funds were the exception, not the rule, in the $150 billion Asia-Pacific hedge fund industry. "You will definitely get bad performance ... (but) the amount of closures -- or blow-up type scenarios -- you won't get as many in Asia as you may get in U.S. or Europe," said Richard Fan, a partner at hedge fund manager UG Investment Advisers, which manages almost $1 billion of assets focusing on China and Taiwan. Research firm HedgeFund Intelligence estimated that 74 percent of the assets of hedge funds dedicated to investing in the Asia-Pacific were managed on a long/short equity basis, meaning they can bet on and profit from both rising and falling share prices. This compared with just 30 percent of hedge fund assets in the United States and the rest of the Americas. LESS LEVERAGE, LESS DOWNSIDE The most heavily geared Asian hedge funds likely employ no more than four or five times leverage, compared with some U.S. funds which might be using 10 to 15 times leverage, said Peter Douglas, founder of hedge fund consultancy GFIA. "Asia is very equity-centric and you don't get that many funds who are on the interest rate side. Those who are on the interest rate side do corporate bonds and government bonds," he said. It has been these types of heavily leveraged funds, often investing in complex instruments like CDOs, that have made headlines. CDOs can include mortgage loans or bonds that are backed by mortgage loans. "You've got a perfect storm, where prime brokers are all pulling in their horns and forcing many hedge funds to reduce leverage at the same time," said Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors, an investment advisory firm. "For the relatively unleveraged, directional long/short equity hedge funds this won't necessarily be a big problem." Analysts said the credit market turmoil meant the diversification of the industry away from less complex equity-focused funds, a cause many had championed as a necessary and positive, will now be set back, potentially for years. In the meantime, the existing equity-focused managers will still be in for a rough ride given the spike in stock market volatility that followed the global credit crunch. Already, some major institutional investors in the region have decided to cut their exposure to hedge funds and take back their capital. But the market impact has been delayed by lockup agreements. Hedge fund managers routinely lock up money for months, if not years, and often require 45 days' advance notice before returning it. "Japanese pensions have been trying to lower their hedge fund exposure; but they can't sell because hedge funds are not letting them redeem capital," said Hitoshi Yamamoto, president of Commerz International Capital Management (Japan) Ltd, whose firm acts as a gatekeeper for Japanese pension funds. But many institutional investors are committed to the asset class for the long term, given the diversification it adds to equity and bond-heavy portfolios, and the money may simply shift from poor performing to more skilled managers, said Kirby Daley, Fimat's head of sales and capital introduction for Asia. "We may see some (managers) shut down, but rather than blow up, they will simply probably just close their doors and return money to investors if they're not viable after a poor performing period," he said. "In that sense, the Asian hedge fund industry overall will be hurt far les
