 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  A high-powered committee Tuesday endorsed the much-expected plan for building a two-lane road connecting Bijoy Sarani with Mohakhali by erasing the Rangs Bhaban. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council nodded the plan that will cost the government more than Tk 122 crore. The projected amount of the plan will be mobilised from the internal resources, it decided. The work on the project is set to start by the end of this month to be complete by June 2009. The official city development agency, Rajuk, will implement the construction. Once built, the facilities will help ease the terrific traffic chaos in the area, according to the project objectives placed before the council. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting that also approved seven other projects. According to the project details, the length of the road is 730 metres while the width will be 18.29 metres. The project also envisages construction of sidewalks, a road island and an 800-foot overpass. A total of 63 buildings, including 49 unapproved ones, have to be demolished to construct the road. Of the total project cost, 40.72 percent will be spent on land acquisition. Meanwhile, Rangs Properties ran an advertisement in different newspapers Tuesday, seeking clients for commercial offices in the truncated six-storey Rangs Tower in Tejgaon. Since the Supreme Court recently ordered demolition of the top 16 floors of the 22-floor Rangs building, the government will have to acquire the land of the once majestic commercial building. The government will have to compensate the Rangs authorities for the lower six storeys that will cost more than Tk 17.54 crore. Another Tk 10.37 crore will be necessary for 13 approved buildings that would be demolished to construct the road. Another chunk of the allocation will be used for buying land. The ECNEC also approved seven other projects including a major power project, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said in a post-meeting press briefing. The meeting nodded a 360-megawatt power plant to be set up in Haripur. The projected cost of the plant is Tk 507 crore. The other projects are a Tk 42 crore-project to construct a 150-bed hospital for government officials, a Tk 115 crore digital mapping project for the Survey of Bangladesh directorate, a Tk 58 core-plan for BIWTC, a Tk 47 crore project for modernisation of Dhaka-Narayanganj rail line, a Tk 49 crore-project for Khulna Railway Station, yard remodelling and modernisation of Benapole Railway Station and a Tk 99 crore-project for supplying safe drinking water. bdnews24.com/ar
