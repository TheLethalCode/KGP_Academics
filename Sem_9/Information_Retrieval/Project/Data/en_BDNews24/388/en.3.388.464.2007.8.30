 MONTE CARLO, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United and AS Roma will meet in the Champions League group stages, just a few months after violence marred their quarter-final clash. The two teams were drawn in Group F on Thursday, along with Sporting Lisbon and Dynamo Kiev. A United fan was stabbed in Rome during their first leg on April 4. There were also scuffles between the fans outside Old Trafford before United's 7-1 victory in the return match. Holders AC Milan were drawn with Benfica, Celtic and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group D. Liverpool, who lost 2-1 to Milan in the final in Athens, will face 2004 winners Porto, Olympique Marseille and Besiktas in Group A. Marseille striker Djibril Cisse, who was used sparingly by manager Rafael Benitez during his time at Liverpool, will have a point to prove. In 2004, the Ligue 1 side knocked the Merseysiders out of the UEFA Cup in the round of 16. Chelsea, who have never reached a European Cup final, will face tough competition in Group B against Valencia, Schalke 04 and Rosenborg. The group stages will be no walkover for nine-times champions Real Madrid, who were drawn in Group C along with Werder Bremen, Lazio and Olympiakos Piraeus. Barcelona, who won the competition in 2006, face six-times French league champions Olympique Lyon, German champions VfB Stuttgart and Scottish runners-up Rangers in Group E. Arsenal were drawn in Group H with Steaua Bucharest, Slavia Prague and the winner of the third qualifying round tie between Sevilla and AEK Athens. Sevilla travel to Athens on Monday with a 2-0 advantage. Italian champions Inter will face PSV Eindhoven, CSKA Moscow and Fenerbahce in Group G. The opening matches are on Sept. 18-19
