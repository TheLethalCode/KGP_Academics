 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid, who were detained on charges of "fuelling" campus violence, have been remanded for another four days amid allegations against their interrogators in open court of mental torture. Just before being taken into the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka Thursday, the two professors had publicly expressed their sorrow over the "attitude shown to the army" during student protests on campus and asked for forgiveness from the army on behalf of the students. Once in court, however, they said physical assaults on other people in front of the teachers had been a brutal tactic of their interrogation. The scenes of physical torture on others had forced them to pass sleepless nights, they alleged. The magistrate heard the professors' allegations before ruling that their interrogators were allowed to question the teachers for four more days on a new set of charges involving the breach of emergency powers rules. CHARGES Security officials had picked up the two professors in separate raids on their university homes a week ago, although their families said the officers did not produce any arrest warrants. The families also said they had no idea where or why the two detainees had been kept in custody until they were produced before the court for the first time on Aug 25. Only then it became clear for the first time that charges of "giving provocative statements and instigating recent violent protests on Dhaka University campus" had been brought against them. The two professors have denied the charges. Anwar Hossain said they had in no way instigated the protests or violence on campus. "The charges against us are false," Hossain told the court of magistrate M Salehuddin. "I'm not lying." Despite their statements of innocence and their allegations of mental torture, the magistrate ruled that the interrogators would question the teachers for four more days in the second case of charges involving a breach of emergency powers rules. The teachers were taken to court after their initial four-day remand expired Thursday. The police sought a 10-day remand for further questioning in the second case but the magistrate granted only four days. In the new remand plea, the police said: "The two teachers instigated the violence at Dhaka University, which was a breach of emergency powers rules." "They led a procession chanting slogans from Fuller Road past Shaheed Minar to Doel Chattar and Bangla Academy. When the police intercepted them, they attacked the police with sticks and brickbats. They led a series of violent activities on the campus," the plea said. The raft of allegations includes leading the attacks on Nilkhet Police Outpost and damage to government and private property. The teachers have also been accused of frightening the general population by burning effigies of different people. "They made provocative statements and were involved in the breakdown of law and order," the allegations said. ALLEGATIONS OF MENTAL TORTURE In addition to the allegations of mental torture, Professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid said they had no idea where they had been kept over the past few days although the charges against them are being pursued by Shahbagh police. Both said they were sure the place of their detention was not Shahbagh Police Station. They said they were taken to an undisclosed locationblindfolded. Their lawyers also stated in court that the two teachers were taken to court on Aug 25 for the first time, 40 hours after they were arrestedwhich runs counter to the law and the constitution. "We'd tried to solve the crisis in the university. So why are we being tortured this way?" Hossain asked the court. "People were physically tortured in front of us to torment us mentally. We were devastated." "I urge the court to order interrogation only at the jail gate or in court. Sending us to a special place for interrogation will amount to injustice," said Hossain. Professor Harun-or-Rashid echoed him. "Other people have been tortured in front of us. We have been mentally tortured. I couldn't sleep," Rashid said. "I have been kept in an unknown place for the last seven days. I am mentally shaken." "I am a Dhaka University teacher. The university is like a family to me. My job is to teach students. I could not sleep for the last few days. I want to tell everyone without fear  here in court." The counsels for the teachers urged the court to reject the remand plea and to issue an order for medical treatment of the accused. One of the teachers is a diabetic patient and the other has high blood pressure, the lawyers said. On the appeal for medical treatment, the court said: "The investigating officer will take care of it. The remand has been approved for the sake of investigation." After a 30-minute hearing, the two teachers were led away from court amid tight police protection. PUBLIC APOLOGY TO ARMY Before being taken into court Thursday, the two professors publicly apologised for student protests on campus and sought forgiveness from all in the armyfrom soldiers up to the army chief. Professor Anwar Hossain claimed that agitated students had attacked security officials and uniformed army personnel, hurting the dignity of the armed forces as a whole. "They felt insulted," he said. "It's an unwarranted incident. Today's military is not the same as the Pakistani army in 1971. I'm sorry about the attitude shown to the army," Hossain told assembled reporters, just outside the CMM's courta few minutes before he was taken inside for the hearing. "Our army has a glorious history. They are symbols of sovereignty, security and unity," he said. "The attacks on the army meant attacks on the sovereignty of the country. I am deeply sorry for the attacks that made the army feel dishonoured and dented their self-respect." "As the general secretary of DUTA and as a guardian of students, I seek forgiveness from all, from an ordinary, yet respectable soldier to the army chief. There is no shame in seeking forgiveness," said Hossain, adding that he hoped his apology would console the army for the attacks. Prof Harun-or-Rashid also regretted the Dhaka University incident. "The attacks on the army in uniform are really unfortunate. I seek forgiveness from all in the armyfrom the army chief to the soldiers on behalf of the students." bdnews24.com
