<TITLE> Europe shares close up, oil and tech stocks shine </TITLE>

 FRANKFURT, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares closed higher on Thursday, boosted by gains in oil and technology shares such as Nokia as hopes that business spending will boost tech profits offset worries about banks' US subprime exposure. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European stocks ended up 1.13 percent at 1,515.44 points, continuing a tentative recovery following a slide of about 8 percent from a 6-1/2 year peak in mid-July. "The markets are still nervous but have calmed down. It looks like we would need really bad news to head back down further at the moment," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equities strategist at Postbank in Germany. "Valuations are more attractive and at justifiable levels, the US economy seems to be stronger than many had expected, financials are still having trouble but this seems to not be limiting the whole market anymore," said Sonnenschein. A US government report showed economic growth held up in the second quarter despite turmoil from the housing sector. The report from the Commerce Department showed that the US economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent in the quarter, as strong business investment led the fastest pace of expansion since early last year. Technology stocks gained strongly, as investors bet that business spending would support the sector's profits. Finnish handset maker Nokia added almost 3 percent to its rise in the previous session when it unveiled an online music store, a gaming service and four new multimedia handsets. Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson also gained more than 2 percent. Index heavyweight oil shares were among major gainers, benefiting from a rise in the price of crude after a big decrease in US inventories. BP rose 1.6 percent, Royal Dutch Shell gained 2.3 percent and Total rose 2.4 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 ended 1.3 percent higher and Germany's DAX rose 1.09 percent. Some banks and financials were able to recover somewhat from earlier losses triggered by fears about the sector's exposure to the US subprime lending crisis. Barclays ended 0.4 percent lower after earlier slipping as much as much as 2.5 percent, while Deutsche Bank ended down 0.1 percent after falling as much as 2.3 percent. But French lender Natixis surged 7 percent, topping risers in Europe, after it said it had cut financing to subprime originators in the United States to zero from 1.5 billion euros at the end of last year. Peer Credit Agricole rose 2.3 percent after it said the subprime crisis had a limited impact on it. A Reuters poll showed on Thursday that the recent credit market squeeze will probably delay an expected European Central Bank interest rate increase until after September, and any subsequent rise beyond 4.25 percent now looks very unlikely. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter that the Fed was "prepared to act as needed" to ensure credit market troubles do not adversely affect the economy, which added to investor speculation about a US rate cut and supported stocks. Global stock markets have been roiled in recent weeks by fears that a crisis in the US subprime mortgage market would hit the broader economy, but analysts said there were positive signals for equities. "There are still parts of the market that are in big trouble, but we're encouraged by central banks trying to sort things out," said Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma. "Sure there will be a growth impact, but it will be a mid-cycle type of slowdown and not a recession," he said, adding that a rate cut would have a more profound impact in such a situation than normal.
