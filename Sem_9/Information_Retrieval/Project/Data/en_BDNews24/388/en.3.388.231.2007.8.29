 BUDAPEST, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A right-wing Hungarian radio station sacked two staff on Wednesday after a picture of a gay senior government official with a pink triangle on his suit in front of the gates of Auschwitz was put on its Web site. The picture of Gabor Szetey, who came out as gay last month, was removed from the www.lanchidradio.hu Web site. "The managers and owners of Lanchid Radio condemn what has happened and apologise to State Secretary Gabor Szetey and to everyone offended by the picture in question," the station said in a statement. The Socialist-led government said the picture showed the far right was growing in strength after a weekend rally at which a paramilitary unit was formed. The rally has fuelled concern over the rise of the far right in ex-communist countries. Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany criticised President Laszlo Solyom at a news conference, saying he had not made a forceful statement condemning the formation of the far-right Hungarian Guard on Saturday. More than 1,000 people attended the swearing in of the group, which sports red and white insignia, associated by some with the wartime Arrow Cross regime which sent hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths. The rally took place outside Solyom's official residence. Jewish groups in Hungary have complained of rising anti-Semitism and the use of symbols like a red-and-white striped flag during anti-government demonstrations last year. Its supporters say it is a medieval Hungarian flag. "So this is where we stand. Fascists marching outside the president's office saying this is pure respect of tradition ... Let's be clear: this is lurking fascism. And the president remains silent, he's speaking only through a head of department, but we are not interested in the head of department," Gyurcsany said. Solyom's office declined to comment on Gyurcsany's comments and said it stood by a statement on Saturday in which it said it condemned "rallies that elicit fear", but did not mention the Hungarian Guard specifically. Solyom has been a critic of Gyurcsany since the leak of a tape last year in which the prime minister admitted he had lied about the poor state of the economy to win a general election. However, Solyom is perceived on the left as being partisan and is the most unpopular president since the end of communism. Gyurcsany and the Socialists also criticised Fidesz for failing to overtly condemn the formation of the guard, which is backed by the far-right Jobbik party, after one of its MPs attended the swearing in ceremony.
