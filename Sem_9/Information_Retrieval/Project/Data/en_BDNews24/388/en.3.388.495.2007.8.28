 ALBUQUERQUE, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A New Mexico motorcycle police officer crashed and died on Monday while escorting US President George W. Bush and his motorcade from a political fund-raiser back to the airport, the White House said. The officer, Germaine Casey, crashed as the president's motorcade was arriving at the airport and his limousine passed by the scene where two other officers were performing CPR on the fatally injured man. An ambulance in the president's motorcade stopped to provide assistance, as did a member of the White House medical staff. A local television station reported the officer had collided with another motorcycle. Bush said he was deeply saddened by the officer's death and grateful for his protection. He later called the officer's wife to express his condolences. "It is a high calling to choose to serve and protect your fellow citizens, and I will always be indebted to Officer Casey's service," Bush said in a statement. Casey leaves behind a wife and two teenage children, said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel. Motorcycle police officers often escort the president's motorcade, blocking off intersections as it proceeds. A motorcycle officer in Hawaii died last year after sustaining injuries in a crash while escorting Bush. Bush was in New Mexico on Monday to help Republican Sen. Pete Domenici raise about $400,000 for his reelection bid. Bush later flew to Bellevue, Washington, where he attended a fund-raiser for Republican Rep. Dave Reichert. who is facing a tough re-election bid next year. The event was expected to raise more than $500,000, most of which is going to Reichert. Reichert won last year by a narrow 7,341 votes. Outside the second fund-raiser, throngs of protesters called for Bush's impeachment and for US troops to be brought home as riot police stood guard.
