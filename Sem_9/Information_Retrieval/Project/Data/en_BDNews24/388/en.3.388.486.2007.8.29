 DUBAI, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's parliament has no immediate plan to hold a vote of no confidence in Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government, but his administration must work hard to keep its majority, Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi said. Maliki's 15-month-old government has been paralysed by infighting, derailing efforts to foster national reconciliation among warring majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs. Ministers from three political blocs, or nearly half of Maliki's cabinet, have quit, accusing him of sidelining them. Some politicians have raised the idea of a no-confidence vote, but nothing concrete has happened. Abdul-Mahdi, a fellow Shi, said the government would continue but should keep an eye on shifting alliances in parliament and not take its waning support lightly. "Parliament does not have any plans to withdraw confidence in the government, at least for now... Today, we back this government and hope it succeeds, but it must work hard," Abdul-Mahdi told Reuters late on Tuesday in Dubai. "There is a sort of splintering that it must monitor closely and seriously. It must not take lightly these withdrawals and the loss of a lot of the backing that it enjoyed in the beginning... If this decline continues, it will be threatened with not being able to garner majority support in parliament." Abdul-Mahdi, one of two vice presidents, is a senior leader in the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council (SIIC), one of Iraq's biggest parties and a key member of the ruling Shi'ite Alliance. The Alliance itself has come under strain, with one of its members, a faction loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, among the blocs to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who visited Baghdad this month, said in recent comments published on the Web site of U.S. magazine Newsweek that many people believed Maliki should be replaced, possibly by Abdul-Mahdi. Kouchner apologised, but some US Democrats, including presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, say Maliki must go. Abdul-Mahdi declined to say if he wanted the job, saying he had no ambitions beyond the vice-presidency. The issue was one for Iraq's parliament to decide, he added. The mounting internal pressure on Maliki's government comes at a critical time in the more than four-year-old Iraq war. In two weeks time, US President George W. Bush's top officials in Iraq will testify to the US Congress on Iraq's security and political situation. With opposition Democrats and some Republicans calling for US troops to start leaving Iraq, the reports by US ambassador Ryan Crocker and US commander General David Petraeus could prompt a shift in Washington's Iraq policy. Abdul-Mahdi said he did not expect any major change in US policy but anticipated a gradual troop withdrawal as Iraqi forces gained the experience and weapons to take over security. He said Iraqi security forces were now leading around 70 percent of operations, up from around 30 percent 18 months ago. "The surge was useful in the end, after all the fuss," he said, referring to Bush's decision early this year to send an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq. "What will the American government decide? I do not think there will be a decision to change course entirely, 100 percent. There could be a gradual cut in troops ... I don't expect sensational transformations."
