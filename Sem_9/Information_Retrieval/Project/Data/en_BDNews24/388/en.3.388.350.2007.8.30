 NAIROBI, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's Anglican Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi consecrated two conservative American priests as bishops on Thursday to lead US congregations who have split from the Episcopal Church over its stand on homosexuality. William Atwood and William Murdoch are among a growing number of conservative U.S. clerics pledging allegiance to African bishops who take a tough line against homosexuality. "As a bishop ... you are to maintain the Church's discipline, guard her faith and promote her mission in the world," Nzimbi told them during a service at Nairobi's All Saints Cathedral attended by hundreds of worshippers. Atwood and Murdoch will be in charge of 30 congregations in the United States who have asked for leadership from Kenya. At the service, they vowed to "serve the international interests of the Anglican Church of Kenya, to serve clergy and congregations in North America under the Kenyan jurisdiction". The 77 million-strong Anglican Communion has been divided since the Episcopal Church, its 2.4 million member U.S. branch, consecrated Gene Robinson as Anglicanism's first openly gay bishop four years ago. The Nairobi ceremony was attended by about 10 primates from the "Global South", made up of churches in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, who support traditional Anglicanism. Nigerian Archbishop Peter Akinola raised a storm in May when he consecrated Martyn Minns as bishop in the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, which is linked to the Church of Nigeria, despite being asked not to by the Anglican spiritual head Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The U.S. Church has accused Africans of invading their territory by consecrating Americans. But conservative Africans say they only want to provide refuge for orthodox believers who are at odds with liberal views. Murdoch is rector of the All Saints Episcopal Church in West Newbury, Massachusetts, while Atwood is general secretary of the Ekklesia Society, a global group promoting orthodox Anglicanism. "This is a missionary action brought to this point by four years of frustration," Murdoch told reporters in Nairobi on the eve of the service. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual head of the Communion but does not have powers equal to those of Pope Benedict in the Catholic Church. The gay clergy row has sapped his influence and brought the Communion close to schism. The Communion is discussing proposals for a so-called Anglican Covenant that could strengthen the Archbishop of Canterbury's authority, but opinions on it are deeply divid
