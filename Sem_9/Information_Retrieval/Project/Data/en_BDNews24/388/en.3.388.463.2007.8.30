 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irving Saladino won Panama's first world championship gold medal with a dramatic last-gasp victory in the men's long jump on Thursday. Saladino took the gold medal with the final leap of the competition, soaring 8.57 metres to extend his winning streak to 16 and record his 23rd victory in 25 competitions. Italy's European champion Andrew Howe had to settle for silver after believing he had done enough to win with his final attempt of 8.47 just minutes earlier. Howe beat Saladino's third-round jump of 8.46 and celebrated by tearing his shirt off and roaring: "I'm the best! I'm the best!" Saladino was forced to wait for the women's 400 metres hurdles medals ceremony to finish before he was given clearance to hurtle down the runway for his final attempt. But the 24-year-old, who displayed none of the posturing or whooping antics of his rivals, dealt superbly with the pressure to pull out a new personal best, 10 centimetres further than Howe. Olympic champion Dwight Phillips took bronze with a best effort of 8:30, the American falling short in his bid for a third successive world title. Panama's only previous podium finishes at a major championships were Lloyd LaBeach's two bronze medals in the 100 and 200 metres at the 1948 Olympics in London. Saladino's win was watched by Olympic great Carl Lewis and world record holder Mike Powell, who set his mark of 8.95 metres after an epic duel with his fellow American at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo
