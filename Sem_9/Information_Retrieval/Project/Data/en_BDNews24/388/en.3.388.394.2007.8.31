<TITLE> AL must win polls to free Hasina: Amu </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Senior Awami League leader Amir Hossain Amu Friday said his party must win the elections and form government to free detained party chief Sheikh Hasina. "The Awami League must go to power to free Sheikh Hasina. And elections are the only means to go to office. We have to engage ourselves in the election process." Amu, known as a key player in spearheading the idea of the so-called reforms in the party, made the comment as he spoke to reporters at his Eskaton home. He dismissed the suggestion that the party will not sit with the Election Commission to discuss electoral reforms unless the party chief is freed from jail. "It's an emotional statement. If it happens the Awami league as a party will not sustain. We must go by the reality." Amu, a member of the policymaking presidium, said all parties should sit with the Election Commission over electoral reforms. "No chances should be taken so that elections are pushed back because the Awami League has skipped voting," he said. "We'll sit with the commission on the basis of consensus (inside the party). There's no confusion." Amu would not say what political issues he discussed with the party's acting president Zillur Rahman during a meeting Thursday. On whether they differed over sitting with the EC, Amu said: "No. I have made my points. I think all political parties should sit with the commission so that no blames can be laid at their doors." Amu said fresh remand of the two detained Dhaka University teachers in a second case was not right. "I think the government should sit with the teachers," he said. bdn
