Since Brown took over from Tony Blair in June, expectations of an early election this year have increased because of polls showing he has a commanding lead over the opposition Conservatives.

The POA said it had taken action because the government had decided to implement a 2.5 percent pay increase in stages, which it argued amounted to just a 1.9 percent rise for its members. Britain's prisoner numbers have reached record levels in recent years, leading to some criminals being released early to ease overcrowding and accusations that the government was mismanaging the criminal justice syst
