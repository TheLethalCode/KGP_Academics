 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A NASA investigation found no evidence that drunken astronauts boarded spacecraft or jets, the US space agency's lead safety officer said on Wednesday. NASA's findings did not support allegations by an outside panel in July that U.S. astronauts had boarded a space shuttle and then a T-38 training jet -- and another time actually launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket -- while inebriated. "I was unable to verify any case in which an astronaut spaceflight crewmember was impaired on launch day, or any case where a manager of a flight surgeon or co-crewmember disregarded their recommendation that a crewmember not fly," Bryan O'Connor, head of NASA's safety and mission assurance office, said in a report released Wednesday. The accusations were part of an outside review of astronaut health issues that NASA administrator Michael Griffin ordered after the arrest of Navy Capt. Lisa Nowak in an attack on a woman in an Orlando airport parking lot in February. Nowak, who flew her first space shuttle mission in July 2006, was fired six months ago, along with shuttle pilot Bill Oefelein, who has said he was involved with both women. Nowak's trial on assault, battery and attempted kidnapping charges is scheduled to begin next month. Her attorney has notified the Florida court that she may use an insanity defense. NASA immediately adopted some of the July report's key recommendations, including additional mental health screenings of crewmembers. But the agency was stunned by its allegations that inebriated astronauts boarded spacecraft and a training jet. Griffin tapped O'Connor, a former astronaut, to investigate the claim. In a review of 20 years of shuttle flight history and 10 Soyuz missions that included a U.S. astronaut flying to the International Space Station, O'Connor said he found no evidence to support the allegations. He also found no cases of NASA ignoring a crewmember or flight surgeon's concern that an astronaut posed a flight risk, as the original review reported. Griffin was to discuss the issue at a news conference later on Wednesday.
