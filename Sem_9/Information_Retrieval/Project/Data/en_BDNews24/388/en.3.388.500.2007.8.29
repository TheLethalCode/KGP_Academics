<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Wed Aug 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian security officials said on Wednesday they had received no intelligence of a terrorist threat to the Asia-Pacific leaders summit in Sydney next week, but had launched the country's biggest ever security operation. Australia's counter-terrorism alert remained unchanged at medium, which meant a terrorist attack could occur, said security officials during a display of security on Sydney Harbour. "That was the threat level we moved to immediately post 9/11, it hasn't changed," said Andrew Scipione, New South Wales state police commissioner from Saturday. "There has been no intelligence of recent times that would tell us we would need to change that level of threat," Scipione told Reuters. If intelligence indicated an attack was likely, Australia would elevate its alert status to high, one short of the maximum alert that an attack was imminent or had occured. Australia, a staunch US ally, has never suffered a major peace-time attack on home soil, although 92 Australians were among more than 220 people killed in bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002 and 2005. The Australian government has spent A$169 million (US$137 million) in the past six years preparing security for the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) week of September 2-9, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said on Wednesday. "There's no doubt that APEC is the largest dignitary protection event we have ever hosted," said Ruddock. A total of 21 leaders, including US President George W. Bush, Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's President Hu Jintao, will attend the APEC leaders' meeting on September 8-9. A multi-layered APEC security operation will see 3,500 police and a 1,500-strong defence force patrolling Sydney. A 45-nautical-mile restricted airspace over Sydney will be enforced by FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft and police helicopters. With APEC leaders meeting inside the Sydney Opera House on the harbour foreshores, navy divers and special forces will patrol Sydney Harbour. Police will erect a 2.8-metre (9-ft) concrete and wire security fence, which will virtually cut Sydney's central business district (CBD) in two, isolating APEC leaders from the rest of the city. The city's underground railway network will be closed during the APEC weekend and motorists have been warned to stay out of the city as many roads will be closed. Many Sydneysiders have criticised the APEC security, claiming it will turn Sydney's inner city into a fortress, with people asked for IDs and bag searches. "In terms of the security we have in place, I will not apologise for doing all that we can to make this the safest and most secure event of its type ever in the world," Scipione said. What concerns APEC security officials the most is the threat of violent street protests against U.S. President George W. Bush. All courts in the city will be closed during APEC to free up police for security -- a move which will also mean anyone arrested can not be freed on bail. Protest organisers say they expect thousands to march during APEC, but police have denied them a permit to march. "We are not proposing to allow those that would want to violently interfere with this APEC event to march or protest inside those restricted areas," Scipione said. The NSW Business Chamber has told shops in Sydney's CBD to prepare for the likelihood of property damage during APEC, prompting many shopkeepers to close during the weekend. Police and protest leaders are still negotiating on where protests will be allowed, with one politician calling for APEC protesters to be quarantined in a city park. APEC street security was dealt a blow on Tuesday when the city's mounted police horses were diagnosed with equine flu and quarantined in stables for a month, ruling out a major crowd control measure. Police say they have backup crowd control measures, including a 12,000 litre (2,640 gallon) water cann
