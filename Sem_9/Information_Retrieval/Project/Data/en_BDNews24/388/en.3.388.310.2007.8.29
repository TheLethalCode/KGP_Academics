 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  A special court dealing with high-profile corruption cases Wednesday convicted former BNP minister Shahjahan Siraj of two counts of tax related fraud and sentenced him to eight years in jail. Siraj's wife Rabeya Haider, better known as Rabeya Siraj, and their son Rajib Siraj each have also been handed down the same punishment on the same charges. Judge Shamsunnahar of Special Judge's Court-4 at the Sangsad Bhaban gave the verdict in three separate cases against the three in their absence since they were on the run. They were separately charged with income tax-dodge and concealing information about tax returns. Shahjahan and Rajib would have to serve five years out in prison for suppressing information about income tax under the Income Tax Ordinance. They were fined Tk 1 lakh each or would face another six months in jail for failing to pay the fines. The father and the son were jailed for three more years and fined Tk 1 lakh for dodging income tax. For failing to pay the amount, they have to suffer another six months in jail. Rabeya was fined Tk 1.5 lakh and would have to suffer another nine months in jail if she did not pay the sum. It was the first verdict against Shahjahan while the same court sentenced Rabeya to a total of 32 years in jail Tuesday in four separate cases that separately involve similar charges of tax dodging. The punishments of Shahjahan and Rajib will come into effect one after another, which means they would have to spend eight years behind bars. The sentences of Rabeya who was jailed Wednesday for eight yearsrunning from a maximum of five years to a minimum of three yearson two counts of charges would take simultaneous effect. She will actually have to spend five years in prison. Public prosecutor AFM Golam Fattah told bdnews24.com Wednesday that Rabeya's five cases have a total of 40 years in jail, but as they would be effective simultaneously she will have to serve only five years in prison from the day she is arrested. In such cases, a convict has to serve out the maximum term of the punishment for a particular case, he said. On July 16, the National Board of Revenue filed 11 cases against the three for dodging income tax. The case filed against Shahjahan by the board's assistant tax commissioner Mosammat Rahima Khatun alleged he had evaded Tk 2.48 lakh in tax by not showing Tk 9.20 lakh he spent including for the marriage ceremony of his daughter in the income tax returns in tax year 2003-04. NBR assistant tax commissioner Pratap Chandra Pal filed the tax evasion case against Rabeya Siraj, alleging she had bought 3.28 katha of land in Sutrapur in the capital valued at Tk 4.32 lakh. But she suppressed the purchase and dodged Tk 58,619 in the tax year 2006-07. The court ordered confiscation of the land. Deputy tax commissioner Abul Kalam Azad filed the tax evasion case against Rajib alleging that Rajib, a director of the Precast Concrete Industries Ltd, had spent Tk 4.33 lakh through his National Bank credit card. He did not mention the spending in his tax returns for tax year 2003-04 and evaded Tk 63,079 in tax. The court framed charges on Aug 8. The court in four separate cases of tax evasion and suppression of tax-related information jailed Rabeya for 32 years. Verdicts in four other cases against Rajib on similar charges are set for delivery on Sept 5. Shahjahan's daughter-in-law Farzana Khan was given six years' prison term on Aug 15 on charges of tax evasion. She is also absconding. bdnews24.co
