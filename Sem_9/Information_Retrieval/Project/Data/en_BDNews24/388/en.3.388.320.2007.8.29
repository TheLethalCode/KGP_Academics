<TITLE> US ex-astronaut Nowak to rely on insanity defense </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former NASA astronaut Lisa Nowak plans to rely on an insanity defense at her trial next month on charges she attacked a rival during the unraveling of a love triangle with fellow ex-astronaut Bill Oefelein, her lawyer said on Tuesday. In court papers the lawyer, Donald Lykkebak, said Nowak would claim she suffered from an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in the run-up to her February arrest for assaulting Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman at Orlando International Airport. She would also cite her marital separation and an inability to confide in members of her direct family, Lykkebak said. Nowak is scheduled for trial on Sept. 24 on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery and burglary stemming from allegations she stalked and attacked Shipman after driving from Texas to Florida -- wearing diapers, according to police, so she wouldn't have to stop.
