 TEHRAN, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran rejected on Wednesday accusations by US President George W Bush that Tehran was fomenting instability in Iraq, and called on Washington to change its policies in the region. "They (the US accusations) are not true," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told Reuters by phone, saying Bush was repeating them "again and again".

With 164,000 US troops in Iraq and patience growing thin in the Democratic-controlled US Congress and the American public, Bush has been defending his Iraq war strategy.
