 Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com) -- An arrested teacher of Dhaka University Thursday expressed sorrow over the attitude shown to the army during the student protests on campus. "It was an unwarranted incident. Today's military is not the same as in 1971. I'm sorry about the attitude shown to the army," Professor Anwar Hossain told the electronic media. Hossain, also general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers' Association, made the remark prior to being produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka. "We also feel dishonoured seeing the insult meted out to an army man in uniform," he said. Hossain claimed that the agitated students attacked security officials and army personnel in uniform, hurting the dignity of the Armed Forces as a whole. "They felt insulted," he said expecting that all misunderstandings regarding the issue would end following his remarks. Security personnel picked up Hossain and colleague Harun-or-Rashid, dean of social sciences, in separate raids on their university homes a week ago following the spread of student protests. Families of the detained teachers had earlier said the officers did not produce any arrest warrants. bdnew
