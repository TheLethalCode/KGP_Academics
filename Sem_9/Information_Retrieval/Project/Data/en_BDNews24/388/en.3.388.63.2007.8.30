<TITLE> Poland moves away from democracy: watchdog </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's ruling Kaczynski brothers are moving the country away from democratic standards respected across the European Union, the Transparency International watchdog said on Thursday. Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his identical twin President Lech Kaczynski have faced accusations they have abused the state apparatus to spy on and discredit their political opponents under the banner of fighting corruption. The detention of a former interior minister on Thursday, who was the main source of charges against Kaczynski's government, has raised fears that they were trying to muzzle critics ahead of an expected snap poll. "There is no question that the norms and standards of a democratic state are being violated in Poland," Anna Urbanska, head of the Polish chapter of Transparency International, told Reuters. "It is hard to think of a similar case in any other member of the European Union. This is a quite unprecedented in European democracies." Prime Minister Kaczynski said the detention of the former minister and several other detentions were normal legal procedures in a fight against corruption. The Kaczynskis came to power in 2005 promising to free the post-communist country from a "network" of businessmen, politicians and professional elites who they say control Poland. But Urbanska said that several of the spectacular "anti-corruption" actions which the Kaczynskis branded a success were politicised and aimed at winning voters' attention. Scenes of spectacular arrests of doctors, businessmen and politicians have been aired by public television but they seldom led to charges or were questioned by courts. "There are several cases where a reputation of a person has been ruined without a reason. This is just unfair and against legal norms," Urbanska said. "The fight against corruption is a good thing but it has been used for political purposes without the right for defence that each person deserves."
