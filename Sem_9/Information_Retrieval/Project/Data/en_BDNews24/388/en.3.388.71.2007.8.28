<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 28 (bdnews24.com)  Citigroup NA, a global investment bank, is set to enter the country's stock market as a merchant bank under the banner: Citigroup Global Market Bangladesh (Pvt) Ltd. It would be the first multinational bank to enter the Bangladesh stock market. Citigroup got the nod Tuesday from a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which broke the ice by shifting from its stance of not issuing new merchant bank licences. The government had earlier stopped issuing new merchant banking licences on the ground that about 30 merchant banks, at present, were good enough to meet investor demands. The SEC said the entry of Citigroup would bring about positive results and help improve the supply side situation, Citigroup Global Market Bangladesh, as per its application, will provide advisory services, work as issue manager, manage debt and equity and operate as portfolio manager. "It is our core strength. We are doing well in the Asia Pacific region. We are pleased to get the opportunity to work for the development of the capital market in an emerging country like Bangladesh," Abrar A Anwar, director of Citigroup NA and Citigroup Global Market Bangladesh told bdnews24.com. "Primarily, we will provide advisory services to our clients and work for managing issues. But we will expand our product offerings progressively as appropriate," he added. SEC chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi observed that the entry of Citigroup would create better results. "It is an internationally reputed institution. I think, entry of Citigroup in the local stock market will bring about a positive impact. Supply of issues may also be improved following its entry," Siddiqi told bdnews24.com. He said that the SEC approved the Citigroup application observing that it had complied with all requirements. "Gradually, we will also award merchant banking licenses to some new applicants," he said. bd
