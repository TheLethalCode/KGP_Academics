 GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban movement freed three remaining South Korean hostages on Thursday as part of a deal with the Seoul government, Reuters witnesses said. Like the previous 16 captives freed since Wednesday, the two women and a man were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ghazni province, from where the Taliban seized 23 South Koreans on July 19.
