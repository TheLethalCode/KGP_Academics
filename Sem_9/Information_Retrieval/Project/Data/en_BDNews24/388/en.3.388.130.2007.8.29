 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Wednesday said recent street violence had made the government rethink a move to immediately lift a long-standing ban on indoor politics. His latest concern came a day after the Election Commission announced that it would kick off dialogue with the political parties in the second week of next month. "We have finalised an outline to lift the ban on indoor politics. But the recent violence in Dhaka University has forced the government to reconsider its implementation," Hosein told bdnews24.com. "The council of advisers will take a (final) decision," he said. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Tuesday said that they would start the much-expected dialogue on electoral reforms with the political parties on September 12. The major political parties have said they are not interested to sit with the EC for talks unless the ban goes. An influential government policymaker told bdnews24.com that a draft detailing the provisions on how the ban could be lifted had been finalised and sent to the chief adviser. The plan envisages phasing out the ban. Initially the political parties will be allowed to practice parlour politics on a limited scale, he said. The draft defined parlour politics, specifying what sort of activities the politicians would be allowed to do indoors, he said. The policymaker, who requested anonymity since he was not authorised to brief the media, said the government had a plan to resume parlour politics in the first week of next month, and the draft had been prepared accordingly. But in the wake of campus violence the plan has been frozen for the time being. "It has not been cancelled," the policymaker said. Many in the government fear the situation might turn from bad to worse if the ban on the indoor politics went immediately. Recent spate of violence that spilled out of the campus into the streets across the country prompted the fear among the policymakers, he said. bdnews24.com/
