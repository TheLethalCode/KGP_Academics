<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP vice president MK Anwar Thursday said the party forum would decide whether to join the dialogue on electoral reforms with the Election Commission. "But no party meetings are now possible due to the prevalent ban on political deliberations. We are not opposed to discussing things, you see," Anwar said in an interview with bdnews24.com. "The EC has taken a well-meaning step to initiate electoral reforms dialogue. But to make it effective, the ban on political activities must go," the former BNP minister said. The EC is set to start dialogue with the political parties on electoral reforms starting September 15. September 22 has been set for its meeting with the BNP. Anwar said the EC needs to be made independent first and only then should it conduct a proper election. He said making the EC truly independent might require amending regulations. "Excepting a few changes here and there the EC is more or less the same entity, as its authority and scope both remain limited as before. "I think the Election Commission needs urgent reforms to its manpower and financial capacity." "For instance, the Election Commission still has to depend on the finance ministry to tailor its budget. As for appointment of the chief election commissioner and other commissioners, new rules have to be in place to avoid controversies over such issues in future," said the former bureaucrat. He added the government should relax the restraints on political activities as soon as possible to render the EC dialogues meaningful. bdnews24.
