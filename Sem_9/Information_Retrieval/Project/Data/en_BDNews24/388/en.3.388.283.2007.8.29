<TITLE> Victorious Hingis plays down expectations </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Martina Hingis said her U.S. Open expectations were low despite a 6-3 6-0 first round rout of Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson on Tuesday. The Swiss, who won the title in 1997, has struggled with hip and back injuries this year but made short work of Johansson, the world number 112. "I have nothing to lose, I feel like I can only win at this tournament, only get better," she said. "Last year I lost in the second round. The last couple months were kind of a rocky road with all the injuries and that (so) every match is a good match. Every victory is a good one." Hingis skipped the event in Toronto a fortnight ago to get herself fully fit and said she finally felt healthy again. "The first couple months (of the year) I played a lot," she said. "I won Tokyo, had quarter-finals again at the Aussie Open. Everything was a smooth ride. But after that, here and there, the injuries came. Everything wasn't a bed of roses anymore. "I played Wimbledon where I had only the (one) week preparation. Now I (have) had two weeks of good training. Sometimes you feel like it's never enough. But I definitely played a good match today. I'll hopefully work my way into the tournament." Hingis next plays French qualifier Pauline Parmentier, with a likely clash with Russian fourth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round on the horizon. "Of course, the first two, three rounds I'm supposed to win," she said. "I really take it one at a time because I don't have that many matches under my belt. I don't know that girl that well, Parmentier. "I have a few people to look at her, to tell me about her. Kuznetsova had last week a good run, winning the tournament. We've played before. Hopefully we get to meet again.
