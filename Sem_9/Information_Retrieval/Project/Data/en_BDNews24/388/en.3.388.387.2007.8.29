 KABUL, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will double efforts against Afghanistan's drug output and plans to destroy the industry, a US diplomat said, days after the UN said the country produced 93 percent of the world's poppy this year. Afghanistan is locked in a vicious circle where drug money feeds both the Taliban insurgency and official corruption which, in turn weakens the government's hold of large parts of the country and allows more opium to be produced. Its output from poppy, the raw material for opium and heroin, has jumped up to 8,200 tonnes this year compared to 6,100 in 2006, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said this week. The international community, led by Britain, has been involved in clamping down on poppy production which has soared since the fall of Taliban's government in 2001. The Taliban had managed to virtually eradicate poppy cultivation during the last year of their rule. US Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Thomas A. Schweich, said his government will take action next year. "Most of the poppy in Afghanistan is now grown by relatively wealthy farmers, corrupt officials and large land owners and opportunists who have turned down alternatives that have been given to them," he told reporters in Kabul on Wednesday. "These people will find that we will be there this spring to eradicate their crops," "Simply hitting the farmers, no matter how wealthy they are is not enough. You have get the traffickers, and the United States will double the amount of resources...into the eradication activity in the next 12 months," he added. He said the US government believed the only effective way was "forced non-negotiated eradication".
