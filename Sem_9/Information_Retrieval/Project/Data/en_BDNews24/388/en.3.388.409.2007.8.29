<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of Orascom Telecom weighed on Egyptian indexes on Wednesday as heightened fears of weakness in the U.S. economy led to selling in emerging markets. Egypt's benchmark Hermes index fell 0.7 percent to 68,272.69 points, its first decline in six trading days. Orascom Telecom retreated 2.8 percent to 64.29 Egyptian pounds ($11.38). "All the markets in Europe and the Far East have gotten bombarded and Orascom has international exposure," said Yasser Hassanein at Dynamic Securities in Cairo. European and emerging markets dropped on Tuesday after US housing data raised fears a slumping housing market could undermine US growth and hurt global lenders. "There is little appetite to buy," said Mohamed Ashmawy, trader at CIBC brokerage in Cairo. "People are waiting to see where the markets are going." Shares of Orascom Construction Industries dropped 1.3 percent to last trade at 366.25 pounds. The company said on Wednesday it would invest $440 million to build a cement plant in South Africa. Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes bucked the trend, gaining 3 percent to 42.24 pounds, still below fair value estimates of two brokerages. HC Securities said this month EFG-Hermes' fair value was 45.29 pounds per share. HSBC said in May the bank's fair value was 48 pounds. "We think its fair value is around 51 or 52 pounds," Ashmawy said. Shares of the bank are trading at an estimated price to 2007 earnings ratio of 14.65 compared to a sector average of 15.40, according to Reuters data. The Egyptian market was trading at an average of about 15 times earnings, Hassanein said. "We have good fundamentals here and we would be doing much better without this drop in global markets," he said. Egypt's Case 30 index fell 0.8 percent to 7,668.25 points. The broader CIBC index dropped 0.2 percent to 366.22 points.
