<TITLE> French PM intent on cutting budget deficit, reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Tuesday his government was determined to improve the health of public finances and push on with reforms to deliver extra growth in the euro zone's second biggest economy. Fillon laid out the reforms already passed by parliament since President Nicolas Sarkozy's May election and said more were in the pipeline for the fourth quarter of 2007 and for 2008, with greater labour market flexibility one of the goals. "For more than a decade, our country has been living with a growth rate that is lower than its main European partners'. It is neither the fault of Europe, nor of globalisation -- it is our responsibility," he said. Fillon said the government would seek to attack two key ills afflicting the economy -- the state budget and social security deficits. "First, that of the public deficit, whose chronic nature is nothing other than a sign of bad management of France," he said. "The 2008 budget marks our fierce will to keep a hold on public finances. We will hold the course, in line with our commitments." Sarkozy has promised other euro zone countries that France will cut its budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2006, and that its deficit will be even lower next year. "The reduction of our deficit is one of our priorities. Our European commitments call for that but, above all and before anything else, national interest demands it," Fillon said. He also spelled out measures to put the social security budget on a better footing, including plans to lengthen, to 41 years from 40, the number of years employees would be required to work before being eligible for a full pension. Fillon also highlighted the dearth of medium-sized firms as one of France's weak points. He said this particularly affected its export performance, but that a trade deficit was not inevitable.
