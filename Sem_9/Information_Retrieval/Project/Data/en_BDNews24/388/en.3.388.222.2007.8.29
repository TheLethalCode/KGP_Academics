 LONDON, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch IT services firm LogicaCMG Plc said on Wednesday its first-half adjusted operating profit fell to 89.7 million pounds ($180.4 million), missing analysts' forecasts and denting its shares. The company said the shortfall was down to margin pressures in France as well as weakness in the UK, though the group's outlook for the market remained unchanged. The profit figure -- down from 108.2 million pounds on a pro forma basis last year -- was about 10 percent below Numis's forecast and 4.5 percent below Landsbanki's. "We expect the shares to be weak today," said Numis analysts Will Wallis and David Toms in a note, borne out by their 2.5 percent fall to 154.75 pence by 1222 GMT. Revenue rose 36.2 percent to 1.525 billion pounds, in line with a trading update last month, while the group also said Deputy Chairman David Tyler would replace chairman Cor Stutterheim, who is retiring. It raised its interim dividend 4.5 percent to 2.3 pence. The first-half performance saw revenue growth in European markets including France and Germany, but was held back by an 8.3 percent decline in the UK, the firm said. Weakness in the UK, stemming from the ending of a contract in the transport sector, led to a profit warning in May and the resignation of long-standing Chief Executive Martin Read. Jim McKenna, currently Chief Operating Officer, will become interim chief executive next month following Read's departure. "A key priority in the second half is improving the operational performance in the UK," he said in the statement. David Tyler, who will take on the chairman's role, having joined the company as joint deputy chairman only last month, said in the statement he was pleased with the progress being made in the search for a permanent new CEO. Landsbanki analyst Michael Donnelly said in a note he expected a new appointment this year, but that the firm could be a takeover target while the position remained vacant. Market rumours linked the company to a bid by private equity house Permira earlier this year.
