 FRANKFURT, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares turned into negative territory on Thursday as US stock futures slipped due to uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates and on mixed reports on the US economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index index of top European shares edged 0.13 percent lower to 1,496.56 points by 1324 GMT, after earlier rising as much as 1.1 percent. S&P 500 futures were down 0.78 percent, Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 0.65 percent, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.59 percent.
