<TITLE> Pakistan's Sharif to return home on Sept. 10 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exiled former Pakistani leader Nawaz Sharif is expected to return home on Sept. 10 to challenge military leader President Pervez Musharraf in forthcoming elections, sources in Sharif's delegation said on Thursday. Sharif, who was ousted as prime minister in a 1999 coup by Musharraf and risks arrest when he flies into Islamabad, was due to speak at a news conference later. Another former prime minister Benazir Bhutto said on Wednesday she had almost sealed a power-sharing deal with Musharraf under which he will quit as Pakistan's army chief. But a spokesman for the president said on Thursday that Musharraf had yet to decide whether to step down as army chief and try to become a civilian president. Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled last week that Sharif, a two-time prime minister, should be allowed to return. Sharif has vowed to oppose a bid by Musharraf for another term as president. After he was overthrown, Sharif was sentenced to life in prison on graft and security charges. He was exiled in 2000. With his term coming to an end and his popularity plummeting, Musharraf has turned to Bhutto for help to shore up his position, and his aides are meeting with the two-time prime minister in London. But Bhutto has insisted an agreement would hinge on Musharraf stepping down as chief of the army, which has ruled for more than half Pakistan's history since independence in 1947. Western governments are closely following the turbulence in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state whose support is critical to fighting al Qaeda and defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan.
