 PLOUTOCHORI, Greece, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek firefighters on Wednesday beat back countrywide forest fires that have killed at least 63 people, but said they fear new flare-ups with a heatwave expected this weekend. "The biggest fronts are either receeding or under partial control," fire brigade spokesman Nikos Diamandis told foreign journalists. "We are concerned because a new heatwave is coming, according to the weather service, peaking on Saturday and Sunday." The conservative government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has faced a wave of accusations of incompetence in its response to Greece's worst fires on record. Facing snap parliamentary elections in less than three weeks, it is now scrambling to provide relief for thousands left homeless by a 6-day inferno that devastated wide swathes of countryside. Greeks are dismayed and angry about the scale of devastation and thousands were expected to attend a protest rally in Athens later on Wednesday, dressed in black. Blazes that had trapped villagers in parts of the southerly Peloponnese peninsula were coming under control but firefighters were still battling fires on the island of Evia and near the northern cities of Florina and Kavala. The government told Reuters it estimated fire damage would be at least 0.6 percent of GDP, or 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and that it would apply for European Union emergency aid. Thousands of people rushed to banks to claim a 3,000 euro initial government compensation handout. Greek TV showed one bank sending angry claimants away after running out of cash. "I had 180 olive trees burned to the ground. I was dependent on that income," said 73-year-old Eleni Sokou after receiving her cash at a bank in Zakharo. As the flames died down, the destruction to the environment and economy of the fertile peninsula was painfully clear. Among the burned trees on the mountainside near the village of Minthi, around 70 charred goat carcasses lay putrefying in the sun, the stench of rotting flesh drifting in the wind. "Everything we had has gone. We had oil, we lived off the olives. It's all gone," said Athanassia Kazakopoulou, 77, from the village of Frixa. The government has declared a national emergency and called for unity and solidarity with the victims. But opposition parties and many people bereaved by the disaster have accused authorities of doing too little too late. "The government has shown that it is completely incapable of managing this major crisis," said George Papandreou, leader of the Socialist PASOK party who hopes to unseat Karamanlis in the elections on Sept. 16. But one opinion poll suggested Papandreou was failing to capitalise on the crisis. The MRB poll conducted on Aug. 26-27 showed the ruling New Democracy party losing some support but still holding a 2 percentage point advantage over PASOK. PASOK dismissed it as skewed. In July some 10,000 people demonstrated after a smaller fire destroyed one of the few remaining forest areas near Athens, demanding it be reforested and not used for building land. Many Greeks believe fires are often started by arsonists on behalf of property developers. The government has offered rewards of up to 1 million euros ($1.4 million) for help in finding arsonists. The fire brigade said 13 people had been charged with arson so far, but only six of them for starting fires intentionally. One man had already been tried and given a suspended jail sentence, a spokesman said.
