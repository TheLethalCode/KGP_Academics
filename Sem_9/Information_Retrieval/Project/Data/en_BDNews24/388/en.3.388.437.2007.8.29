 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com) - Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed has differed with law adviser Mainul Hosein in defining the incumbent government, saying it is a non-party caretaker government. He said the army is part of the government as in any country and not backing the makeshift administration. "I don't think so (that it's a military-backed government). This is a caretaker government. The army is part of the government and we have remained so," General Moeen told reporters Tuesday while visiting Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF) in Gazipur. His comment came a day after law adviser Mainul Hosein termed the present government "military-backed national government". The reporters asked Moeen whether he would agree with the adviser's comment. The army chief went to the BMTF to see the manufacture of high-quality military boots, belts and other leather goods. The BMTF with the assistance of a Taiwanese company produces military boots, which have huge demand on the local and international markets, the BMTF officials said. Moeen also spoke on minimum wage for garment workers. On non-compliance of a tripartite agreement in the readymade garment industry, the army chief said: "The government is putting pressure on errant garment factories to provide the workers with minimum wage. The workers must be given minimum wage." In line with the agreement involving garment owners, workers and the government, the minimum wage has been set at Tk 1,662.50. There are widespread allegations that the owners are not paying the minimum wage to their workers. The naval chief, Vice Admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam, and the air force chief, Air Marshall SM Ziaur Rahman, accompanied Moeen. bdnews24.
