 BIRMINGHAM, England, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ian Bell, England's top-scorer in their last three one-day internationals against India, has credited assistant coaches Andy Flower and Allan Donald for the turnaround in his game. Flower, who played 63 tests and 213 ODIs for Zimbabwe until 2003, is England's specialist batting coach and his input seems to be having an effect as they lead India 2-1 in the seven-match series. Bell's game has blossomed after advice from the former left-hander who once topped the world rankings, as he has scored 126 not out, 64 and 79 in the three games in the series to date. "I've enjoyed working a lot with Andy Flower, he has given me, certainly in those middle overs, some ideas on how I can improve my batting, which has helped," Bell told Reuters. "In the past, although I wouldn't say I have had a fear of failure, I have got stuck a few times without hitting boundaries and he has given me some options. "Speaking to guys who played against Andy, they say he was one of the greatest players of spin and for a period was the best. It's nice to get ideas from him about how he went about his game and how I can put them into mine." Bell, 25, who said he has also benefited from the faith shown in him by head coach Peter Moores, has spent hours in the nets with Flower working on playing spin in preparation for the tour to Sri Lanka from October. He also praised the contribution of his ex-Warwickshire team-mate and former South Africa fast bowler Donald, England's bowling coach until at least the end of the Twenty20 World Cup next month. "Allan Donald has been fantastic in the dressing room and very passionate about the way he talks about playing for your country," Bell said. "That's one thing he has brought into the team, how much it means to you to play for your country. "I've never really heard people talk like he does. He's a very passionate person and it made me think about it," said Bell, who was speaking at the launch of an NPower urban cricket initiative. "I guess when you are playing a lot of cricket and travelling all the time you can take it for granted and having him talking so passionately has made people think about it." England and India play the fourth one-day match at Old Trafford on Thursday
