 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks rallied for a fourth day Wednesday, triggered by a rush in the buying of shares of banks after the government amended the banking companies law with provision to raise banks total capital requirements up to Tk 2.0 billion from the existing Tk 1.0 billion. "The amendment has given a boost to the bank stocks as well as the market. Investors expect that banks will issue bonus or right shares to raise their capital bases," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 750 million in funds. The council of advisers Tuesday approved the amendment to the Banking Companies Act, 1991, expected to be effective after publication as an ordinance. Banks with capital less than Tk 1.0 billion moved up the most with prices of some banks touching a new level. Heavyweights in the power sector also buoyed the market. Provision of raising capital might also bring the market to a new level, as the banking sector constitutes over 50 percent market capitalisation on the bourses, Sayeed said. The main DGEN or general index reached 2455.85, up by 29.31 points or 1.20 percent. The DSI or all-share price index moved up 32.15 points or 1.58 percent to 2059.71. The DSE-20 blue chip index added 10.65 points or 0.53 percent to 1993.53. Some 87,78,730 shares worth Tk 1.88 billion were traded. But losers beat gainers 106 to 77 while 18 held steady. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange finished upbeat led by banks. A total of 15,02,408 shares worth Tk 289.03 million were traded and 47 issues rose, 50 lost and six closed unchanged. Prospects of growth drove power sector shares higher. The engineering sector also gained. But pharmaceutical stocks fell while the cement sector and mutual funds closed mixed. Market major Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, the most traded issue, ascended 0.44 percent to Tk 615.75. The state-run power company earlier said that it had earned Tk 17.46 per share in the first half of 2007. BRAC Bank and AB Bank led the gain in banking stocks. BRAC Bank increased 1.13 percent to touch an all-time high of Tk 1050.75. The bank reported 74 percent rise in its shares to Tk 216.96 million in the January-June period of 2007 from Tk 124.74 million in July-December period last year. AB Bank, which posted Tk 134.13 earning per share in the January-June period this year, moved up 5.87 percent to Tk 2170.25. Summit Power gained 0.51 percent to Tk 1518.5 on reports of a plan to raise its authorised capital to Tk 3 billion from the existing Tk 1 billion. Buying pressure pulled The City Bank, one of the most traded issues, 6.88 percent up to Tk 678.75. National Bank grew 7.32 percent to a one-year high of Tk 1241.25. It said its first six months' (Jan-June) earnings per share stood at Tk 48.04. Uttara Bank surged to an all-time high. UCBL also climbed to a new level despite a slight fall. Rupali Bank rallied, but DESCO slipped on profit taking. bd
