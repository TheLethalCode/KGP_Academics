 SEOUL, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean missionary groups said on Wednesday they would pull out of Afghanistan to comply with a deal Seoul struck with Taliban insurgents for the release of 19 Christian volunteers held for almost six weeks. Relatives of the hostages, who erupted in joyous cheers on hearing the news of the deal on Tuesday, were meanwhile eagerly awaiting their release and return. "Our work for now will be to make sure the freed hostages return safely and have the time to recover, and to make sure the family members of the two who were sacrificed are comforted," said pastor Bang Yong-kyun at the Saemmul Church in suburban Seoul.

An official at The Frontiers, a Seoul-based Christian aid group said all its short-term volunteers in Afghanistan have pulled out and two long-term volunteers are about to return. There are an estimated 17,000 South Korean Christian missionaries abroad, the largest contingent after those from the United States, many of them in volatile regions. For many increasingly wealthy evangelical churches in the country, dispatching Christian volunteers abroad has turned into a competition among churches, with larger numbers considered a gauge of the strength of their fai
