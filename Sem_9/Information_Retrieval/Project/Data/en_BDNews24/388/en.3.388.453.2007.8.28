 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A South African court blocked authorities on Tuesday from changing the name of the country's capital, Pretoria, on road signs, fuelling a racially charged debate over efforts to change names dating from the colonial and apartheid periods. Pretoria High Court Judge Bill Prinsloo issued an injunction barring Pretoria's municipal government from changing the city's name to Tshwane, in honour of an early tribal leader, on road signs pending a court challenge by white groups opposed to the move, SAPA news agency reported. Prinsloo ordered officials to come up with a plan detailing how they would implement the change and make it available to opponents. The judge's decision was cheered by members of the white community, particularly Afrikaners, who are the descendants of the original white settlers. Pieter Mulder, leader of the Freedom Front Plus, a tiny white party that challenged the name change, said in a statement the injunction was a victory for South Africans who cherished "cultural goods and the supremacy of the law". Mulder and other Afrikaner leaders have accused the ruling African National Congress of downplaying and erasing the contributions of whites to South Africa in a rush to honour prominent anti-apartheid activists. The ANC, which has ruled the country since the first all-race elections in 1994, says removing the names of leading apartheid and colonial figures from street signs, buildings and monuments is a necessary rebalancing of the historical scales. The effort -- which has seen Pietersburg become Polokwane and Port Elizabeth rechristened as Nelson Mandela Metropole among others -- met its stiffest resistance in Pretoria, which is home to a large Afrikaner population. The proposed Tshwane name change was the main issue in the municipal election in 2006, galvanising white voters and prompting fears within the ANC that it could lose support or even surrender control of the city. The ANC won the election. The battle also has led to what some see as a rekindling of Afrikaner nationalism, particularly among the youth who see themselves as untainted by the crimes of the apartheid era but are disenchanted with the ANC's focus on black empowerment.
