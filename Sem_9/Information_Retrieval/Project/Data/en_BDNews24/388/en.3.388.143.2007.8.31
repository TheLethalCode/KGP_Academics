 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - US stocks rose slightly on Thursday amid relief that vials of chemicals found a UN building posed no danger, while credit market troubles and signs of a pick up in jobless claims lifted Treasuries on a safe-haven bid. United Nations officials found chemicals, which had been removed from Iraq a decade ago, in a U.N. building in New York, but said there was no danger. The Dow and the S&P initially fell on the news in volatile trade, but later recovered, helped by technology shares, which also led gains on the Nasdaq on bets that business spending would support the sector's profits even as the housing slump hampers growth in other parts of the economy. "Investors are buying into the technology sector. We've started to see a shift in investor psychology to growth stocks," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale Illinois. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 12.11 points, or 0.09 percent, at 13,301.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 2.75 points, or 0.19 percent, at 1,466.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 20.69 points, or 0.81 percent, at 2,583.85. Apple Inc. led the Nasdaq's advance with a gain of 2.5 percent to $137.47, amid continuing buzz about the expected launch of the company's newest iPod digital media players. In US government bonds, data showing initial jobless claims are trending higher and Federal Reserve figures showing issuance of commercial paper was at a virtual standstill also contributed to buying. Buying reached across the Treasury curve as investors looked for the most liquid assets they could find. In recent weeks companies have had trouble raising short-term capital as growing mistrust over bad subprime mortgages stifles lending. "With less demand for asset-backed commercial paper, people are likely investing in bills and we are still seeing some pretty rich bill prices and that is just playing into demand for all kinds of Treasuries." Matthew Moore, economic strategist at Ban of America Securities in New York. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 9/32 higher in price for a yield of 4.53 percent from 4.57 percent late on Wednesday. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The market was unmoved by the auction of $13 billion worth of five-year Treasury notes. The yen rose modestly, recovering from the previous day's sharp decline, as investors continued a longer-term trend of reducing risky bets in response to troubled credit markets. The euro was down 0.6 percent at 158.00 yen, having swung sharply between 159.00 and 154.50 yen over the past two days. The move also dragged the euro down 0.2 percent versus the dollar, to $1.3646. The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 115.80 yen after posting its biggest daily percentage gain against the yen since January 2005 on Wednesday due to a surge in US stocks. In Europe, shares closed higher on gains in oil and technology stocks. The FTSEurofirst 300 ended up 1.13 percent at 1,515.44 points. Energy shares also pushed up shares in Japan, with the Nikkei rising 0.9 percent to close at 16.153.82 points. Elsewhere, US crude oil futures slipped after soaring 2.5 percent Wednesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude was down 21 cents or 0.30 percent at $73.28 per barrel. Gold futures eased, with the most-active gold for December delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange down $1.4 at $674 an o
