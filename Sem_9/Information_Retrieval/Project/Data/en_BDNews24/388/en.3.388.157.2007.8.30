<TITLE> Romania eyes electoral system reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's main political parties have agreed to reform the country's outdated electoral system, blamed by pro-democracy groups for fuelling graft, ahead of a Nov. 25 election for the European parliament. President Traian Basescu, the EU newcomer's most popular politician, has threatened to call a national referendum to push through the electoral system's reform and make politicians more accountable to voters. Opinion polls showed around 80 percent of Romanians want to cast ballots directly for individual candidates instead of the current party lists, where voters have little say over who takes up posts in the 469-seat two-chamber parliament. "We reached an agreement with parliamentary parties on the draft and if everything goes well the senate might adopt the changes later next month," Cristian Parvulescu, head of Pro Democratia think tank, which drafted the change, told Reuters. "The referendum threat put pressure on parties to back it." Parvulescu said the new voting scheme, under which parliament seats would be cut by around 20 percent, was inspired by the German electoral system. It is designed to have 203 constituencies across the country of 21.6 million people. After months of negotiations among Romania's warring government and opposition parties, the new electoral system appears to be gaining ground. But analysts say many deputies will probably oppose it. "It is going to be quite a dramatic change and many deputies, being afraid of losing their seats because they are unknown to voters, could try to resist it," Parvulescu said. Basescu renewed his referendum threats on Tuesday, saying he will schedule a referendum for the same day as the EU parliament elections if the electoral system is not changed by Oct. 25. Squabbling among Romania's politicians has intensified since Bucharest joined the European Union at the start of this year, hampering policy making and preparations for absorption of EU funds.
