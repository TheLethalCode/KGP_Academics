 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Floods have caused more than Tk 904 crore worth of damage to highways and other transport systems, according to the Local Government Engineering Department. The maintenance division of the local government ministry has been asked to disburse the funds from its own coffers in the short term instead of a reallocation of the money from the flood rehabilitation fund. The finance ministry has already allocated Tk 350 crore to regenerate flood-affected areas although only Tk 80 crore has so far been released, according to a letter from the local government ministry released on Aug 19. According to the local government ministry's estimates, about 16,282 kilometres of metalled roads were damaged in the recent flooding. A further 6,656 kilometres of un-metalled roads suffered damage. The survey also shows 1,446 bridges and culverts in need of repair as well as 5,865 kilometres of link roads and 130 kilometres of boundary dams, in 40 different districts. bdnews24.com/
