 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday after a sharp drop in US crude and gasoline stocks revived supply concerns in the world's top consumer. US crude gained $1.62 to trade at $73.35 a barrel by 1:21 p.m. (1721 GMT) while London Brent was up $1.43 at $71.99. Crude oil inventories fell by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 24 after storms in the Gulf Coast helped delay imports, the Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday. Gasoline stocks dropped 3.6 million barrels, bringing them to a record low of just 20 days of supply, the EIA added. "On balance, the EIA report is constructive. Crude stocks fell as imports dropped sharply, probably affected by Hurricane Dean," said Andy Lebow of MF Global. "Gasoline supplies fell further, putting us deeper into a hole as there is a fairly robust refinery maintenance season ahead of us." Some analysts have forecast supply could struggle to keep pace with demand later this year unless the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ramps up oil production. OPEC officials have steadfastly said global supplies are ample and blame refinery problems for fuel tightness. OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri on Tuesday suggested the cartel would leave output levels steady when it meets on Sept. 11 in Vienna. But he added that the crisis in US subprime loans had made it tougher for OPEC to chart oil policy by clouding the demand growth picture. "The situation in the past couple of weeks has become a lot more serious," he told Reuters on Tuesday. The deepening crisis in US subprime mortgages -- loans made to high-risk borrowers -- has rattled financial markets and knocked US consumer confidence to its lowest level in nearly two years. Oil has held up well compared to other commodities, but the US benchmark has fallen from an all-time high of $78.77 on Aug. 1 as some investors worry that a global credit crunch will take its toll on the wider economy and erode oil demand.
