 MAPUTO, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mozambican President Armando Guebuza sacked his attorney general on Wednesday, replacing him with a popular judge who gained prominence as an anti-corruption fighter. In a statement released by his office, Guebuza, who is under growing international pressure to crack down on widespread graft in the southern African nation, announced that Augusto Paulino was taking over from Attorney General Joaquim Madeira. Guebuza, who vowed to tackle corruption after taking office in 2005, did not give a reason for the change. Political observers said it was probably tied to Madeira's failure to take on corrupt judges and government officials since forming a special anti-corruption unit two years ago. The effort has failed to charge anyone with corruption. "Guebuza wants people who can help him to govern and (help) in his fight against crime and corruption," said Carlos Jeque, a Mozambican political commentator. Antonio Frangulus, a prominent Mozambican lawyer and university professor, added that Paulino was "the most credible lawyer Mozambique has ever produced". Paulino, the head judge of the Judicial Court in Maputo, the country's capital, gained widespread public attention in 2003 when he presided over the trial of six men accused of the 2000 murder of investigative journalist Carlos Cardoso. It is believed that Cardoso was killed for attempting to expose corruption at the highest levels of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), which has ruled the country since independence from Portugal in 1975. The defendants were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms in a trial that was broadcast live in Mozambique, a rarity in the African nation. International observers hailed Paulino's handling of the proceedings as a triumph of transparency. Paulino also pushed for an investigation into allegations that Nyimpine Chissano, the son of former Mozambican president Joaquim Chissano, was involved in Cardoso's murder. Nyimpine Chissano has denied any role in the crime.
