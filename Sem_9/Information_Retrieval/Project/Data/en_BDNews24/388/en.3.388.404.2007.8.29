 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnew24.com) - A meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order Wednesday discussed the introduction of campus police and campus intelligence agencies for security of universities. But no decision was taken. Senior officials, including those in the home ministry, have been asked to examine and review the matter. A senior official who attended the meeting said the issue came up for discussion due to objections, raised by some people, to the presence of law enforcers including police, on university campuses. The 10th meeting of the committee was held at the home ministry Wednesday afternoon, chaired by Mainul Hosein, chairman of the committee and law adviser. Committee members, education adviser Ayub Quadri, home secretary Abdul Karim, IGP Noor Mohammad, DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khondker and other officials were present. After the meeting, Mainul said arrangements would be made for hawkers to sit in some areas including Gulistan and New Market so that they could continue their business during the Ramadan and Eid. Shops will be kept open as usual, instead of closing at 8pm, during the period. Mainul said the government had been considering lifting the ban on indoor politics, but the decision was deferred due to the Dhaka University violence. "The government will think it over afresh," he said. Asked about the enrollment problem students would face if the universities remained closed, he said the government was thinking about how soon the universities could be reopened. Contacts were being maintained with the university authorities, Mainul said, adding that the education ministry would soon take a decision to return academic life to campuses. Former Supreme Court judge Habibur Rahman Khan's statement that his enquiry commission would not be able to work if Dhaka University was not reopened, Mainul said that if the commission faced difficulty, its tenure would be extended. On publication of the report of the judicial commission, he said that if there were no risks to state security, it would surely be published. "And if any, only part of it will be published." The adviser alleged that the Dhaka University incident was designed: shops were targeted and looted. "The culprits had already been identified and the search was on to nab them," he said. Home secretary Abdul Karim said the meeting discussed the Dhaka University violence that continued from Aug 20 through Aug 22. The law enforcers had been directed to arrest the people responsible and arrange their punishment, Karim said. In the violence, 74 police officers were injured in Dhakafour of them senior officers, he said. Karim said: "Although the country was in a state of emergency, organisations including banks and insurance companies could hold annual general meetings." "However, they must be cautious so that the emergency powers rules were not violated," he said. The meeting also decided to allow the BNP to lay wreaths at the grave of former president Ziaur Rahman on the occasion of the party's founding anniversary. However, no banner or any discussion will be allowed. bdnew
