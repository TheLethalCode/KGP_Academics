 RABAT, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Morocco's largest opposition Islamist group predicted a lower voter turnout in next month's parliamentary elections because of widespread apathy toward polls it says have spawned a "powerless" government. "The conditions of fair and genuine elections which generate political majority that rule and implement its agenda do not exist here," said Fathallah Arsalane, one of al Adl Wal Ihasne (Justice and Charity)'s leaders and its official spokesman. "We have institutions with names like the ones in the West -- elections, parliament -- but their substance has no bearing with democracy and fair competition," he added. Adl, Morocco's biggest opposition group with an estimated 200,000 members, is tolerated but not accepted as a legal party. It seeks bold reforms that would trim the king's powers. It also rejects the king's role as Amir Amoumine (Commander of the Faithful). It will not field candidates in the Sept. 7 election but it could have an impact on the polls by influencing voters to stay at home. "I believe that a majority of the people will not take part in the vote. Those who will vote will do so because they have family links with candidates or have been promised money or work," Arsalane told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "If you remove these incentives, no voter would go to the polls on Sept. 7. The Moroccan people had many bitter experiences with polls and heard many lies," he added. Voter turnout in Morocco has fallen from 67.4 percent in 1984 to 51.56 percent in 2002, a sign of voter disillusionment, local and foreign analysts say. The government says it has an awareness campaign to try to rekindle voter enthusiasm, aiming for a turnout at least as large as the last election in 2002. If turnout drops even further, analysts say it would cast doubt on the political process and weaken the already limited powers of the parliament. Thirty-three political parties and dozens of independent candidates will compete on Sept. 7 for seats in the 325-member parliament, including the moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), which is tipped to outperform most of the other parties. The election will be the second parliamentary vote under reform-minded King Mohammed, who ascended the throne in 1999 on a wave of popularity after his father's iron-fisted rule. Mohammed has been pushing for gradual reforms but he is keeping tight control over the levers of power, including naming a prime minister and vetoing laws. Asked if he had evidence voters will stay way from the polls, Arslane said: "The light of the day does not need evidence". "From our relations and contacts with the people and the election campaign ambiance, we see coldness and apathy indicating the turnout will be worse than in the past elections," he added. Asked if his group would call Moroccans to boycott the vote, he said: "The Moroccan people do need anyone to tell them to boycott the elections. They are actually boycotting because they mistrust all the political proces
