<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) general secretary Sirajul Islam Bachchu said that he was not aware of the possibility of the deferment of the upcoming SAFF Championship to be held in Sri Lanka and Maldives from December 10 to 22. "I don't know anything about the SAFF Championship deferment published in different national dailies Wednesday as we are yet to receive any verbal or written deferment proposal of the SAFF Championship by India," Bachuchu told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Different national dailies Wednesday quoting Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan carried stories that India sought the SAFF Championship deferment as the time clashes with their national football league schedule. "We have earlier finalised the championship date following India's proposal as they told us that they would postpone their national league during the championship, and no meeting was held with regard to the championship deferment in India," said Bachchu, who is also BFF vice president. He said that he was regularly in touch with the concerned person and had a conversation with Moni Lal Fernando, development officer of Sri Lanka football Federation and vice president of Asian Football Federation. Bachchu said that the draw for the championship would be held in the third week of September and that they would visit the venues at the same time as he received a letter Wednesday from the sponsoring agent, World Sports Group. He, however, said that they would discuss the matter if India proposes to defer the tournament. "India and Bangladesh are given the top priority in the SAFF Championship considering their football tradition and craze among the spectators," Bachchu said, "They will sit together about the deferment if India wants." "We don't want that any team among eight nations is skipped from the tournament," said the SAFF general secretary.
