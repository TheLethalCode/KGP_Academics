 LONDON/SINGAPORE, Aug 30 (bdnews24.comReuters) - France's Nicolas Sarkozy warned on Thursday of a threat to world growth posed by the US home loan crisis but a Bank of Japan policymaker said the recent market turmoil had been overdone. The French president sounded his warning as financial markets perceived a sliver of doubt had been cast on the prospect of a US rate cut next month. "Financial turbulence is threatening world growth," Sarkozy told a conference run by France's Medef employers' organisation, adding that banks had a key role to play in supporting growth. "For banks, playing along does not mean lending more to speculators than to companies and households. It does not mean tightening credit to the economy to compensate for the excessive risks they have taken on the financial markets," he said. Most politicians and policymakers until now have said the global economy was weathering the fallout from high-risk US subprime lending mainly to poor people relatively unscathed. In a letter released on Wednesday, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed was "prepared to act as needed" to ensure credit turmoil did not harm the economy, firming expectations for a rate cut at its Sept. 18 meeting. But the Wall Street Journal's Fed watcher Greg Ip, without explicitly suggesting a rate cut was in doubt, said the central bank was in no rush to lower rates because it wanted to disabuse investors of the view that it was there to bail them out. "They hope that taking time to weigh the economy's need for rate cuts will help discourage investors from thinking Fed officials are overly concerned with falling asset prices," his article said. A senior OECD official said the Fed should avoid aggressive rate cuts purely to rescue investors who had made bad decisions. "If the Fed thought ... the economy was going to go into recession, then it would be appropriate to cut interest rates," Adrian Blundell-Wignall, deputy director of the OECD, told the Medef conference. "If the Fed cuts interest rates because of this financial crisis, to me that's a bad policy," he said. US stocks slid slightly as investors grappled with the mixed views about the Fed's intentions although most analysts still expect it to lower its benchmark federal funds rate. "The Fed will have to cut 25 basis points ... because expectations of a cut seemed to have stabilised asset prices," said Nick Parsons, head of market strategy at nabCapital. Bank of Japan board member Atsushi Mizuno, the lone advocate of a BOJ rate rise at the last two policy meetings, said a Sept. 18 cut in US rates would change the basis of discussion in Japan but not necessarily rule out a BOJ rate rise the next day. Calming the panic in financial markets was the most immediate task, Mizuno said in a speech to business leaders. "To my eyes, there is market confusion that went beyond rational repricing (of risk)," he said. The US commercial paper market shrank sharply for a third week, according to Federal Reserve data showing credit markets remain tight despite central bank actions to revive lending. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said US house prices rose 3.2 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, representing the slowest appreciation in a decade. All eyes will now be on Bernanke's speech on "Housing and Monetary Policy" on Friday. Shares in French bank Natixis gained 6 percent after it posted a rise in first-half net profit and said it had cut its financing to subprime originators in the United States. Peer Credit Agricole rose 2.5 percent after it said the subprime crisis had a limited impact on it. But Freddie Mac, the United States' second largest source of home loan funding, reported second-quarter net income fell 45 percent from a year earlier as more borrowers defaulted. US tax adviser H&R Block Inc said it was renegotiating the sale of its money-losing Option One Mortgage Corp subprime lending unit to Cerberus Capital Management LP, casting doubt on its ability to complete the transaction. And Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland said it was cutting back its collateralised debt obligations team following a drop in market appetite, confirming the departure of a leading executive. In Japan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a broadside at ratings agencies, which have been criticised for contributing to the market confusion by being too slow to warn about the problems in the US mortgage sector. "If we look at how the mortgage crisis happened, we have often experienced that what was rated highly in the end turned out to be much more unstable," she said.
