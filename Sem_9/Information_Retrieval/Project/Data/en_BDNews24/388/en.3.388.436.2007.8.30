 MADRID, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - BAA, the owner of Britain's three biggest airports, is not planning to sell any airports and has not decided on any job cuts, the firm said on Thursday after a newspaper said it was planning 2,000 job cuts. However, BAA, the airport unit of Spanish infrastructure and construction firm Ferrovial, said it was undertaking a review of back-office functions, which did not involve security or customer service staff at its airports. "No conclusions have yet been reached, and the review is ongoing," BAA said. The Times newspaper reported on Thursday that BAA, whose airports include London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, was looking to axe up to 2,000 jobs and may be preparing to sell one or more of its airports. "Ferrovial have a huge debt burden, and they can't sustain that," The Times quoted a BAA source as saying. "They are really drilling down costs, and there is going to be a complete restructuring of the business, with a couple of thousand of jobs going. It cannot be the security staff, but every other element of the business is up for review." Stephen Nelson, CEO of BAA, hit back on Thursday, calling the report exaggerated and misleading. "No decisions have been taken around the loss of support jobs, and we do not recognise the specific number used by The Times," he said. Ferrovial declined to comment on the matter on Thursday. Ferrovial shares lost earlier gains to trade 0.3 percent lower by 1321 GMT, in line with a lower Spanish blue-chip IBEX index. BAA has come under criticism for long queues and ageing infrastructure at Heathrow and Gatwick. The British airport operator was bought by Ferrovial in a 10.1 billion pound ($20.4 billion), debt-fuelled takeover last year.
