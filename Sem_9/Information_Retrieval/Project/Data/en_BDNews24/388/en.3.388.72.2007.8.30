<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders made a commitment at talks in Vienna on Thursday not to do anything to endanger a new round of internationally mediated talks on the future of the breakaway province. European Union envoy Wolfgang Ischinger said both sides agreed in initial, separate meetings "to make no acts or statements ... that might jeopardise the troika process or be provocative for the future". The troika -- made up of Ischinger and envoys from the United States and Russia -- has until Dec. 10 to mediate a solution to the deadlock over Albanian demands for Kosovo's independence and Serbia's rejection of their secession bid.
