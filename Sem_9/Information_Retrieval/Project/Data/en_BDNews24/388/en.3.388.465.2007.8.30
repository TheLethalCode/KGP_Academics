 KIEV, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian election officials completed registration on Thursday for next month's parliamentary election which may fail to end a power struggle between the country's top leaders. President Viktor Yushchenko, swept to power by "Orange Revolution" rallies, called the election to halt what he says was an attempt by his rival, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, to boost his majority in the chamber and seize power. Each rival hopes his camp will win enough seats to form a viable coalition in parliament after what is certain to be a long process of post-election negotiation. But opinion polls show little change is likely in the assembly's composition. The Central Election Commission said 21 parties and blocs had registered for the Sept. 30 election -- compared with 45 in the last election, little more than a year ago. But only a few of the groupings will figure in parliament after the vote. Yanukovich's Regions Party tops polls with 25 to 30 percent. But its score, combined with Communist allies, is roughly equal to the "orange" camp, made up of the president's Our Ukraine party, a second allied group and the bloc of the Revolution's most fiery advocate, ex-prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. "The groups are running very close in terms of ratings. There will be no decisive victory," said independent political analyst Oleksander Dergachyov. "This will be a contradictory parliament of transition." The pro-Western Yushchenko defeated Yanukovich, backed by Moscow, in a rerun of the 2004 presidential election after weeks of protests and launched an agenda of moving Ukraine closer to the West and eventually joining the European Union and NATO. But his first government soon collapsed in bickering. Last year's election spawned 4-1/2 months of turbulent coalition talks, with "orange" groups failing to form a government and allowing Yanukovich to make a comeback and challenge the president's powers. Building a coalition this time is unlikely to prove any easier, with the stakes high as whoever is named prime minister gets a head start before a 2009 presidential election. There are now few distinctions between the two camps in terms of orientation towards Moscow or the West. Both sides have concentrated on improving the living standards of Ukrainians, where average monthly salaries stand at about $250, and building on economic growth last year of 7.1 percent. Yushchenko hopes the election will do away with long-running political battles. He backs creation of a council to revise the post-Soviet constitution and restore some of the powers he lost in a deal struck at the height of the "orange" protests. Yanukovich says he also wants to revise the constitution, but mainly to give more powers to regions.
