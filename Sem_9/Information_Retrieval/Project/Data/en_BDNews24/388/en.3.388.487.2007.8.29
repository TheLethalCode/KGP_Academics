 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks rose on Wednesday, recovering from the prior session's plunge, as shares of Altria Group Inc. jumped on expectations it may spin off a unit, while bargain-hunting drove a rebound in technology shares. Higher oil prices boosted energy shares. Shares of Altria jumped nearly 2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as the company's board met. Shares of Apple Inc rose more than 3 percent, helping the Nasdaq Composite index top 1 percent immediately after the market open. "The market is a little oversold, and bargain hunters are coming into the equation," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The market is also getting closer to when the Fed will lower rates." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 81.61 points, or 0.63 percent, at 13,123.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 8.48 points, or 0.59 percent, at 1,440.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 17.93 points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,518.57. Shares of Altria, widely expected to announce a spin-off of its Philip Morris International cigarette unit, gained 1.6 percent to $70.16 on the NYSE. The stock was the biggest advancer on the Dow, and among shares contributing to gains on the S&P 500. On the Nasdaq, shares of Apple climbed 3.2 percent to $130.85 after Goldman Sachs recommended Apple before the expected launch in early September of new iPod products. Shares of close-out retailer Big Lots Inc rose more than 9 percent to $28.71 after the company posted a profit that topped Wall Street expectations. ID:nN29316564 US crude oil futures rose 80 cents to $72.52 a barrel, helping major energy companies like Exxon Mobil, which rose 0.5 percent $83.43. But investors were keeping an eye on developments in credit markets stemming, which made for volatile trading. A structured investment vehicle managed by British hedge fund Cheyne Capital Management said it was seeking to restructure after being forced to start selling assets to pay down debt.
