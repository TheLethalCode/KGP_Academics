 OTTAWA, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Canadian War Museum has bowed to pressure from veterans and agreed to change a controversial exhibit critical of Allied bombing of German cities in World War Two. The decision had some historians crying foul that a public outcry could force a change but others said the exhibit had given an inaccurate impression of the bombing campaign, which killed 600,000 Germans. The exhibit refers to how the value and morality of the bombing campaign remains bitterly contested. The museum in Ottawa is still deciding how to revise it, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. "Although Bomber Command and American attacks left 600,000 Germans dead, and more than five million homeless, the raids resulted in only small reductions in German war production until late in the war," the display reads. Veterans complained that it made them look like indiscriminate bombers directly responsible for the deaths. It is a raw topic with them since 10,000 Canadian airmen -- 140 times the entire Canadian death toll in Afghanistan since 2002 -- were killed in the campaign. A Senate subcommittee also weighed in to recommend changes, and the museum, which put up the exhibit when it moved into new facilities in 2005, has now decided it could be worded better. "I think it's shameful. It's a terrible surrender by a public institution to public pressure," said University of Toronto history professor emeritus Michael Bliss. He said it was important to include a question about the effectiveness of the campaign because of a tenacious belief, especially in the United States, that bombing works. "Your judgments about wars ... have huge consequences for the future," he said. However, one of the military historians who recommended a change, the University of Calgary's David Bercuson, said to refuse to correct errors as a matter of principle was simply stubbornness. "I don't see it as giving in. I see it as correcting something that was unfortunately and badly placed in the first place, and I don't see why anyone shouldn't be given leeway to correct errors," he said. He said he thought the bombing campaign actually had a significant impact on the war, and that rather than showing a picture of burned Germans near the text the museum could have shown a destroyed refinery or a field of German aircraft grounded for lack of fuel. Bercuson said that the museum even contradicted itself on the military effects of the raids, diminishing it in the exhibit in question but speaking about its effectiveness in another display across the room. That other exhibit says the Allied bombing raids "diverted German resources from other fronts and damaged essential elements of the German war effort." Museum spokeswoman Christina Selin said the panel in question would be revised but "we have not yet determined how the new text will read."
