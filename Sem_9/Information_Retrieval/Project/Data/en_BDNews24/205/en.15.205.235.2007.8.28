 HONG KONG, August 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks stalled on Tuesday as fresh fears about the outlook for the US economy offset healthy profits and orders at firms in the region, while the yen firmed as investors trimmed exposure to riskier assets. Exporters and US-linked firms were among the decliners after US data showed the number of unsold homes reached its highest level in more than 15 years in July, adding to concerns about the housing market and consumer spending. But signs of healthy orders boosted the region's shipbuilders, while Hong Kong's markets were buoyed by stronger-than-expected earnings at China Life Insurance Co, the country's top life insurer. The increased prospect of a cut in US interest rates to cope with the slowdown also helped underpin equities. "Investors are adjusting to the fact that the US economy is slowing, so calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its next meeting are going to increase," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was unchanged at 0337 GMT. The index, which had its biggest weekly gain on record last week, has rebounded 16 percent since hitting a five-month trough on Aug. 17 and is less than 8 percent below its July 24 record high. Wall Street stocks closed weaker on Monday after the soft housing data, which hit shares of US banks, brokers and mortgage lenders, and also dented stock in industrial conglomerates dependent on economic growth. Most Asia Pacific stock markets opened lower, but pared early losses to edge higher. Hong Kong blue chips rose 0.7 percent and China plays jumped 1.3 percent after China Life, the country's top life insurer, shot up almost 7 percent following better-than-expected first-half earnings. Seoul shares rose more than 1 percent as shipbuilders rallied following a raft of new orders. SHIPPERS BOOST NIKKEI, YEN WEIGHS Shipbuilders also helped lead Japan's Nikkei average up 0.2 percent, offsetting drops in exporters and retailers. Exporters struggled as the yen rose against the dollar and euro after weak US data further stoked worries about rocky credit markets, prompting investors to trim risky assets. The dollar slid to 115.52 yen from 115.85 yen in Monday's late US trade. The euro edged down to $1.3630 from $1.3645. Against the yen, the European single currency fell to 157.35 yen from 158.10 yen. The high-yielding Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent to $0.8245 Problems in credit markets due to losses tied to US subprime mortgages sparked a wave of risk aversion earlier this month, causing higher-yielding currencies to fall while boosting the yen sharply as investors rushed to unwind carry trades. The yen has given up some gains since central banks worldwide pumped cash into banking systems to relieve the squeeze in money and credit markets, which helped revive investor risk appetite. In debt markets, safe-haven government bonds were firm to little changeD across the region, with an offering of 20-year bonds weighing on Japan's market. The September 10-year Japanese government bond futures fell 0.03 points to 135.41. Oil prices were steady at above $72 on Tuesday, with US refinery shutdowns reviving supply concerns, just as the summer driving season draws to a close. US crude inched up 6 cents to $72.03 a barrel by 0113 GMT, building on Monday's 88-cent rise. London Brent rose 7 cents to $71.02 a barrel.
