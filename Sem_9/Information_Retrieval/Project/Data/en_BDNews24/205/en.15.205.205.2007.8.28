<TITLE> Watson could fill test opener's spot, says Ponting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Ricky Ponting believes all-rounder Shane Watson could replace retired opening batsman Justin Langer in Australia's test side. Phil Jaques and Chris Rogers are widely considered to be the most likely candidates to step in for Langer but Watson, a key figure in Australia's one-day team, may also come into consideration. "We've got some excellent competition for quite a few spots in the side," Ponting told reporters at a training camp in Queensland on Tuesday. "The opening batting is probably the one that has been the most spoken about over the past few months." Watson usually competes with Andrew Symonds for the all-rounder's spot in the test team but both could play if the former moved to the top of the order. "It is an interesting one for sure. I would imagine that Symmo would start," Ponting said. "Maybe Watson and Symmo can play in the same side. "If that happens, Watson's got to bat up the top of the order somewhere. "He has given every indication that he could do that. That's one of the dilemmas that he will have. "I haven't really sat down with all the selectors about which way they're heading or what they are looking at." Watson will be touring India with Australia's one-day team in October before Ponting's men play two home tests against Sri Lanka and a four-match series against India
