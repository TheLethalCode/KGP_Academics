 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has appointed former national cricketers Rafiq-ul-Alam and Naimur Rahman Durjoy as selectors on a two-year contract. "Rafiq-ul-Alam will replace Faruque Ahmed as the chairman of the selection committee while Naimur Rahman will take the place of Athar Ali Khan," said a BCB press release Tuesday. The one-month extended contracts with Faruque and Athar expire on August 31 and the new selectors will take on their responsibilities from September 1. Akram Khan is already in the three-member selection committee as the former national captain was appointed on July 1 on a two-year contract. The new national selectors were nominated by a panel entrusted by the ad-hoc executive committee of the BCB on a specific set of criteria. Rafiq-ul-Alam, renowned for his aggressive batting and all-round qualities, first played for Bangladesh in 1980. The 49-year-old cricketer represented Bangladesh in two one-day internationals during the tour of Sri Lanka in 1986, and appeared for the country in the ICC Trophy in 1982 and 1986. He last played for the national team in the ACC Trophy in Singapore in 1992. Alam is currently playing his role as a BCB match referee, and is also involved in coaching. Naimur Rahman is Bangladesh's first Test captain, who guided Bangladesh in the inaugural Test against India in November 2000, and the first Bangladeshi bowler to record a five-wicket haul in Test with 6 for 154 against India. The 32-year old all-rounder played in eight Tests and 29 ODIs. He remained out of international cricket after playing his last Test and one-dayer against the West Indies at home in December 2002.
