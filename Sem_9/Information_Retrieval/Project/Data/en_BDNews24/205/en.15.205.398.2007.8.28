 MILAN, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian striker Adriano has refused Inter Milan's suggestion that he should go out on loan, instead demanding a permanent move away from the Italian champions if he is not going to be selected. The 25-year-old was not included in Roberto Mancini's squad for Sunday's 1-1 draw with Udinese on the opening weekend of the season after falling behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Julio Cruz, David Suazo and Hernan Crespo in the pecking order. Adriano, a target for former club Parma, has endured a difficult couple of seasons with patchy form and weight problems meaning he lost his place in the Inter and Brazil sides. "I don't want to go on loan again. I already went once to Parma when it was right for my career. Now if I must really leave, I'll go and that's it," Adriano told Gazzetta dello Sport. "What I and my agent don't understand is why they did not tell me immediately at the start of the summer that I had not re-entered their plans." Adriano said ideally he would like stay and regain his place at Inter and that the club owed him after he turned down moves to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea when he was in top form three years ago. Inter President Massimo Moratti said English teams were among those interested in a loan deal but that he would not be sold permanently. "He has two choices in front of him. Do really well with us or do really well on loan and return to us as the formidable centre forward that we know," he told Gazzetta. Moratti has said that if Adriano leaves before the transfer window closes on Friday, fellow reserve striker Alvaro Recoba will be have to stay at Inter rather than go to Torino
