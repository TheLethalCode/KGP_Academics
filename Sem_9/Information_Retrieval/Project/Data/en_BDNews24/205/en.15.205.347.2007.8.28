<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday stayed the proceedings of an audit-related case against BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in the trial court. The HC also declared the troubled Dinkal Publications Ltd defunct. Khaleda was one of its directors. Earlier, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka set Sept 27 for Khaleda's appearance in court in connection with the case. But the proceedings of the case came to a halt because of the HC order. On June 11, Abdul Mannan, deputy registrar of the Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms, filed a case with the trial court against 13 Dinkal directors including Khaleda Zia, Tarique Rahman and Mosaddek Ali Falu. The HC also asked the Dinkal directors to donate Tk 5 lakh to flood-affected people and deposit Tk 1 lakh in the Supreme Court Employees' Welfare Fund. In July, former speaker Sheikh Razzak Ali and Rokonuddin Mollah, also Dinkal directors, submitted writ petitions with the High Court to wind up the company. A single-member HC bench of Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed declared Dinkal defunct after reviewing the appeals. bdnews24
