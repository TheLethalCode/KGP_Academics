 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- Prime Minister Gordon Brown rejected on Tuesday a call to pull British troops out of Iraq, insisting they still had an important job to do battling militias and providing security. In an open letter to an opposition party leader, he argued it was wrong to say the continued presence of British troops would achieve little, or to say that they were severely restricted in what they can do. "UK forces in Basra continue to have the capability to strike against the militias and provide overall security," he said in the letter to Menzies Campbell, leader of Britain's third party, the Liberal Democrats, which opposed the Iraq war. Campbell had called for a timetable to pull out, saying casualty levels were now unacceptable, but Brown said this would "undermine our international obligations, as well as hindering ... our armed forces and increasing the risks they face." "They will continue to work with the Iraqi authorities and security forces to get them to the point where they can assume full responsibility for security," Brown wrote. Britain has around 5,000 soldiers in Iraq, stationed mostly in the south, in and around the second city of Basra. Some 2,200 troops have pulled out in the past year, and British generals are gearing up to pull out of the last city base in Basra in the coming months -- partly because some feel their presence there is making the security situation worse. At least 41 British soldiers have been killed in southern Iraq this year -- the highest number of British casualties since the first year of the war led by American troops in 2003, when Britain had a total of 18,000 troops in the country. President George W. Bush, facing waning US public support for the war in Iraq, sought on Monday to reassure Iraqi leaders that the United States would not waver in its support or pull out of Baghdad and the surrounding areas prematurely. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband stressed Britain remained committed to the coalition but told BBC radio: "Our decisions about Basra are about the situation on the ground in Basra, not the situation on the ground in Baghdad." In his letter, Brown said decisions on Iraq would be made "on the basis of advice from our military." "We, together with the rest of the international community, have undertaken to support the country's political and economic development," he said. "These are commitments it is not in our interests simply to abandon." Commentators are also expressing increasing concerns about Britain's ability to sustain high-level military campaigns in both Iraq and Afghanistan, where around 7,000 British troops are leading NATO forces in the increasingly volatile south. Brown's comments came as the head of the British army warned of a "generation of conflict" ahead for British forces if they failed in Iraq or Afghanistan. According to The Times newspaper, General Sir Richard Dannatt warned at a conference in June from which media were barred that success was vital in these places. "If we fail in either campaign, then I submit that in the face of that strident Islamist shadow, then tomorrow will be a very uncertain place," the Times quoted him as having said. Brown acknowledged that Afghanistan was proving "tough, dangerous and difficult" for British troops, but defended the performance of his military commanders there.
