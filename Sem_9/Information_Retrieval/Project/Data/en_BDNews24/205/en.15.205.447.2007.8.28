 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba has aborted her plans of completing a second world 5,000 and 10,000 metres double in Osaka because of stomach cramps. Dibaba on Tuesday pulled out of her showdown with fellow Ethiopian and Olympic champion Meseret Defar in the 5,000m. "It really bothered me in the 10,000 metres. The stomach cramps are very painful but I have had them on and off since last year's world cross country championships," Dibaba told reporters earlier on Tuesday before making her decision. Organisers later issued a statement saying she would not be able to compete. Dibaba became the first woman to win the 5,000 and 10,000 at the same world championships in Helsinki in 2005 and defended her 10,000 crown with a remarkable run at the weekend. She had been left languishing at the back of the field and looked out of the race after being accidentally tripped on lap 13 but stormed back to win gold. "That took a lot out of me," said Dibaba. "Usually the pain only comes when I run but there is a pain on the right side of my stomach when I'm not running now." Dibaba's absence leaves countrywoman Defar the red-hot favourite to win the 5,000m after she smashed her own world record in the distance in June. "I've prepared intensively for these world championships with the record in Oslo," said Defar
