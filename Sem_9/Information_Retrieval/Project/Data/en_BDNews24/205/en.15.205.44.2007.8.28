<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Open champion Serena Williams worked harder than expected but came away with a 6-3 7-5 victory over unseeded Angelique Kerber of Germany in the first round of the U.S. Open on Monday. The eighth-seeded Williams, an eight-times grand slam winner, needed 77 minutes to dispatch the 19-year-old Kerber, ranked 67th in the world. Williams, often left short of breath after being sent corner to corner by the German lefthander, served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but Kerber rose to the occasion, registering a service break set up by a crosscourt passing shot. That seemed to motivate the American, who broke right back and then served out the match as Kerber netted a forehand on double matchpoint. Williams belted 38 winners to just 12 for the German, but she also committed far more unforced errors -- 26 to 12 for Kerber. Next up for Williams is unseeded Maria Elena Camerin of Italy, a 6-3 7-6 winner against Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus
