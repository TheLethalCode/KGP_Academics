 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Human error was responsible for Torri Edwards being briefly and erroneously named as the winner of the women's 100 metres at the world championships, the IAAF said on Tuesday. Confusion reigned in the Nagai Stadium on Monday night when Edwards' name was flashed up on the scoreboard in first place when it appeared that Veronica Campbell and Lauryn Williams had crossed the line first in a blanket finish. Jamaica's Campbell was eventually confirmed gold medallist, while defending champion Williams won silver in the same time of 11.01 seconds. "It looked like there was a bit of confusion, I can tell you there certainly wasn't," Paul Hardy, competitions director of athletics' world governing body, told a news conference on Tuesday. "The system was absolutely correct, the judging was correct but unfortunately it was human error... "While the time was read correctly, the lane was input incorrectly. That's why we had the American (Edwards) who appeared as first when she finished fourth. "We're very satisfied with the timing service. The process is very effective." Hardy said Campbell and Williams had been separated by just three thousandths of a second, the closest margin of victory in the women's 100m at the championships since Gail Devers edged Merlene Ottey by just one thousandth of a second in 1993. "It was very, very close but in the end it was a correct result," Hardy said
