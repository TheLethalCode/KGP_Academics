<TEXT>
 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Over 50 employees of Japan's host broadcaster at the world athletics championships have been taken ill with suspected food poisoning. Broadcaster TBS and Osaka organisers said on Tuesday that 59 people had gone to hospital after eating a buffet lunch supplied by an independent catering company. "It was a regular buffet with Japanese, Chinese and Western food," TBS producer Shinsuke Tanaka told Reuters. "The heat could have been a factor in the food maybe going off quickly. "We suspect it is food poisoning but the authorities haven't formally confirmed that yet." By Monday night 59 people had been taken to hospital with stomach pains and 13 were kept in overnight for observation. "They were put on intravenous drips and four have since left hospital so there's nine still in. We are hoping the rest will be released this evening if the doctors consent." Osaka's city health department were conducting checks on the catering firm hired by TBS. World championships organisers were quick to point out that the problems were unrelated to facilities at the athletics venue. "TBS informed us last night of the situation but it's entirely unrelated to the media venue food," public relations chief Yasuhiro Uchiyama said. "It's an independent company TBS have been using -- nothing to do with the organising committee.
