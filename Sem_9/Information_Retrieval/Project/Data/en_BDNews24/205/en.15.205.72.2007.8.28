<TITLE> BTTB's submarine cable connectivity back after 10 hours </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Chittagong-Cox's Bazar fibre optic transmission link with the country's only submarine cable was back up after about 10 hours of disruptions through Monday, an official with the BTTB said. The breakdown of the link created "congestion" in the overseas phone and disrupted internet services. The transmission link came back up at 00:25am Tuesday after it snapped at 2:30pm Monday, according to Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. In a statement, BTTB said the link snapped at Chokoria, some 120 kilometres off Chittagong towards Cox's Bazar, the second time it has gone down with in a week. The telecoms system broke down earlier on Wednesday, isolating Bangladesh from the rest of the world for 19 hours after suspected saboteurs cut off the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar underground optical fibre transmission link. Monday's scene of incident is close to Wednesday's place of occurrence, but BTTB did not confirm if it was an act of sabotage. Officials at the state telecoms provider said a few international voice circuits had been temporarily diverted through the satellite backup links. They said a technical team has started repairing the damaged cable, but would not say when the link would be back on. bdnews
