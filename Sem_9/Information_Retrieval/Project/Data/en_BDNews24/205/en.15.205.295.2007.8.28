 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The British High Commission in Dhaka Tuesday said the UK did not seek to offer its own assessment of the nature of recent unrest in Bangladesh. In a statement, the British High Commission said: "We are pleased that a situation has been reached in which the curfew could be lifted." The statement was meant to clarify the UK's position on the recent widespread violence stemming from a Dhaka University incident, which led to the curfew in six divisional cities. "We understand that the caretaker government will not allow these events to deflect from its desire to prepare credible elections, as per the election roadmap. We welcome this," the statement said. "We are aware of concerns over reported incidents of harassment and beating of journalists and students. The UK had urged restraint and has publicly condemned these reported incidents. "We recognise the important role of the media. We call on the government to investigate reported incidents thoroughly and to take appropriate actions against those responsible. "Indeed, throughout the tenure of this caretaker government, the UK has consistently urged the government, army and law enforcement agencies to act impartially, with respect to public safety, human rights, media freedoms, due process and the rule of law, in line with its European Union partners in Dhaka and these have been delivered to the caretaker government at the highest levels. "Our previous comments to the media have recounted the understanding of the government and others that initially spontaneous student protests became imbued with external co-ordination. After a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday, British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury blamed the street violence partly on the soaring prices of daily essentials and public grievances. Tuesday's statement said: "This was a serious disturbance with the potential for strategic consequences, hence the government's decisive action to bring the situation under control." bd
