<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 28 (bdnews25.com)  The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Tuesday said that "unnecessary" queries by bankers for businessmen, who open letters of credit and withdraw money, hurt businesses, imports and commodity supply. The industry and trade lobby group demanded an immediate stop to such queries to help businessmen regain confidence and work for improving the daily essential supply situation which, according to Bangladesh Bank, is one of the main reasons of soaring inflation. "Unnecessary questioning during opening of LCs, withdrawal and deposits of money scare businessmen. It is creating a negative impact on businesses, supply of commodities and opening of letters of credit. It should be stopped immediately for enabling businessmen to work fear and panic free," said FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain. Nasir made the appeal from a press conference organsied to clear FBCCI views on stabilising price level during the Ramadan. "We face questions when we go to withdraw cash of over Tk 5.0 lakh. We also encounter inquiry during opening accounts. Such obligations on KYC (Know Your Customer) should be withdrawn," Hossain said. Bank clients have been encountering the queries after the central bank, in line with its move to combat money laundering, had directed banks to know their customers when they come to open accounts, withdraw or deposit money of Tk 5.0 lakh or above. "Prices of commodities have increased between 40 percent and 115 percent in the last one year. It is the reality and we should work in a coordinated manner to fight the increases," he said seeking support from the government, bankers, tax and customs officials. The FBCCI president demanded reduction of margins against LCs and withdrawal of administered exchange rates in the state-run banks to expedite imports. The total volume of imports, according to the FBCCI president, was lower last fiscal year although the total value of imports was higher than a year ago. Imports grew 16.35 percent to $17156.80 million in the July-June period of last fiscal year from $14746.40 million a year ago. The apex body also demanded keeping land ports open seven days a week to steady supply of goods. It also called for industry owners' outlets in industrial areas so that workers could buy commodities at fair prices during Ramadan. bd
