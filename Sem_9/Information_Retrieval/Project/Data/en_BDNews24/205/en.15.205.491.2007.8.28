 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Concerns about the US economy prompted investor caution on Tuesday, cutting into what had been a recovery in stocks and boosting the yen. Wall Street looked set for a weak start a day after soft US housing data hit shares of US banks, brokers and mortgage lenders and dented stocks in industrial conglomerates dependent on economic growth. The US data played to global investor fears that a slumping US housing market will both undermine growth and, through failed mortgages, threaten financial stability among lenders and the overall ability to borrow. "What we have here is a phase where the markets are attempting to find a level around which they can stabilise. They are going to remain a bit touchy and sensitive to the slightest bit of bad news or the slightest bit of good news," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London. Markets have been fluctuating between nervous risk aversion and attempts to return to where they were before the crisis over U.S. risky mortgages hit in mid-June. MSCI's main world stock index is down around 7 percent from its all-time high hit in July 20, but it has recovered about the same since hitting a low on Aug. 16. Worries had the upper hand on Tuesday. European stocks dropped, threatening a daily loss for the first time in eight sessions. Shares of financial institutions were among the worst hit, including Royal Bank of Scotland, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.7 percent. Earlier, Tokyo shares edged down. The benchmark Nikkei average lost 13.90 points or 0.1 percent to 16,287.49, while the broad TOPIX index fell 0.2 percent to 1,584.60. The yen rose while high-yielding currencies came under pressure. "People are a bit wary that bad news could come out any second, particularly from the US financial sector, so they are reluctant to get back into carry trades," said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING. Japan's currency has become something of a proxy for risk appetite and aversion -- falling and rising, respectively -- because of its role in the carry trade, where investors sell yen to buy assets in higher-yielding currencies. The dollar was down 0.2 percent versus the yen at 115.50 yen. The euro was flat at 157.86 yen, but held rose 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.3644. The euro found support after an Ifo survey showed German business sentiment fell less than predicted, indicating growth momentum in the euro zone's biggest economy is not slowing as much. Benchmark 10-year euro zone government bonds gained, with the yield dropping 1.2 basis points to 4.238 percent, but were held back by the marginally better-than-expected Ifo survey. Spreads between emerging market sovereign debt and U.S. Treasuries widened slight
