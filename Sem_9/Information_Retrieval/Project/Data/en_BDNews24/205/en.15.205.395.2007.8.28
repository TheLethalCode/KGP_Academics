 MUMBAI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian skipper Ricky Ponting leads the nominations for this year's International Cricket Council (ICC) annual awards, figuring in as many as four individual categories. The 32-year-old Ponting, who led Australia to an unprecedented hat-trick of World Cup titles in West Indies in April, is in the race to retain both the Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year awards. He has also been nominated for ODI Player of the Year and Captain of the Year awards as per the preliminary list released by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed at a news conference on Tuesday. The shortlist was made by a five-man selection panel headed by former India captain Sunil Gavaskar for the one-year period starting from Aug. 9, 2006. The awards function will be held in Johannesburg on Sept. 10, a day before the start of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, who led his country to the World Cup final this year, and seven others are in the race for three awards each. Jayawardene, chosen Captain of the Year last year, is the only other contender for the honour besides Ponting. Australia's retired paceman Glenn McGrath and batsmen Michael Hussey and Matthew Hayden are on the lists for Cricketer of the Year, Test Player of the Year and ODI Player of the Year. The batting trio of England's Kevin Pietersen, Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf and West Indies Shivnarine Chanderpaul as well as Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan are also contenders in the above three categories.
