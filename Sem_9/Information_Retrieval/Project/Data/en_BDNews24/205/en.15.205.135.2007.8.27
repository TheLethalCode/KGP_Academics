 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said his party colleagues were disheartened, sad and frustrated at Monday's Supreme Court stay orders on the bail awarded earlier to Sheikh Hasina in the two separate extortion cases against her. Speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home on the Appellate Division's verdicts, he said: "We thought our leader would overcome today the problems and injustice she has been facing. But that did not happen." "We have respect for the law and the justice system," he said. "So we are obliged to obey the court order." Zillur nevertheless described the Appellate Division order as better than the worst-case scenario. "The court did not scrap the leader's bail; it stayed the bail. In this we see a flicker of hope." He urged AL leaders and workers throughout the country not to become restive, and face the situation peacefully as they have done in the past. However, Zillur said the AL wished the case proceedings in the High Court to begin as soon as possible. Zillur spoke to reporters after a meeting with party presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Tofail Ahmed and Motia Chowdhury. bdnews24.co
