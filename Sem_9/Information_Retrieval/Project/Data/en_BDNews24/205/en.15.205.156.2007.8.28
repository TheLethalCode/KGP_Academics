<TITLE> Textile products must diversify to keep up exports growth: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday stressed increasing productivity and diversification of markets and items to sustain the growth of textile exports in the wake of any removal of EU restrictions on Chinese textiles. "I urge the industry people to diversify products and markets immediately," Azizul told a seminar on "Impact of removing EU safeguard measures against China" organised by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The seminar also pulled in development partners, trade experts, exporters and academicians, who made similar observations. The EU imposed "safeguard measures" on Chinese textile imports in 2005 to prevent a surge in Chinese exports to the EU soon after the phase-out of the quota system at the end of 2004. The restriction, imposed under a WTO provision, will be withdrawn by the end of 2007, if not extended further. The EU safeguard measures however have benefited some other exporters of textiles and clothing, including Bangladesh. Consequently, there are fears for Bangladesh as the EU provision is likely to end this year. The finance adviser suggested that Japan, Australia, New Zealand and former Soviet Union countries could be potential markets for Bangladesh exporters. He assured the businesses of all cooperation from the government in this regard. "We're serious about creating a congenial environment for investors." Dr Stefan Frowein, ambassador and head of the Delegation of the European Commission, said the EU safeguards on Chinese textile exports are a temporary measure designed to counter the severe market disruption threatened by a sudden surge in Chinese exports. Frowein said that he was confident a skilled Bangladesh would hold its position after the withdrawal of EU safeguard measures. "Long-term democratic stability, with attendant business confidence, will be the key factor in sustaining Bangladesh's export performance," he said. The other two challenges he mentioned were social compliance and developing technical expertise. Bangladesh's economy depends heavily on the exports of textile and clothing for foreign exchange. In the immediate past fiscal year, these exports accounted for 76 percent of the country's total exports worth $12.1 billion. There are apprehensions among the policymakers and the business community as to how much Bangladesh can compete in the EU safeguard-free environment. As far as the textile and clothing sector is concerned, the EU is a major trade partner of Bangladesh. In 2006, over 90 percent of Bangladesh's knitwear exports ($4.5 billion) were destined for EU markets. Holger Fraider, charge d'affaires of Germany, Prof MA Taslim of Dhaka University, and Prof Mustafizur Rahman, Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya of CPD, and businessmen Matin Chowdhury and Annisul Huq spoke among others. BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque chaired the function, where BKMEA launched an institution, Institute of Apparel Research and Technology. bd
