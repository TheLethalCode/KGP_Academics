 NEW DELHI, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian communists have agreed to be part of a government panel to study a controversial civilian nuclear deal with the United States and address concerns of left parties opposed to it, a top leader said on Monday. Communist opposition to the deal has sparked the biggest crisis of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition, which came to power in 2004 with their support, and has raised fears that the government could fall before its five-year term ends.
