 Dhaka, August 28 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has decided to start dialogue with political parties on electoral reform issues starting September 12, the chief election commissioner said Tuesday. CEC ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters that invitations for dialogue would be sent out to 15 political parties in Bangla alphabetical order. "The invitations and a set of electoral rules will be sent out to the political parties starting Wednesday," he said. "In case one or two parties are skipped in the process by mistake, the EC will call them later," Huda said. The EC will hold the discussions with the political parties through September-November. Meantime, indoor politics may also be initiated on a limited scale, the CEC hoped. bdnews24
