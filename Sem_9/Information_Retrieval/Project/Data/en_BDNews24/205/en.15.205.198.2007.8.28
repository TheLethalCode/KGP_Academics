<TITLE> Acer to acquire Gateway </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sheena Lee and Sophie Taylor TAIPEI/SHANGHAI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's Acer Inc will buy Gateway Inc for $710 million to double its US presence and unseat China's Lenovo as the world's No. 3 PC maker, while dealing a blow to its efforts to grow in Europe. Gateway said Monday it would exercise its right to take a first attempt at buying the parent of Paris-based PC maker Packard Bell BV. The move is a setback for Lenovo, which had also been courting Packard Bell to expand its relatively weak presence in the European consumer market. Acer Inc said it entered a definitive agreement to pay $1.90 per Gateway share, representing a premium of 57 percent over its Friday close on the New York Stock Exchange. Gateway stock rose 59 cents, or 49 percent, to $1.80 Monday. Acer plans to keep the Gateway brand in the United States and said the deal would create a company with more than $15 billion in sales and 20 million PCs shipped per year. The acquisition would help Acer displace Lenovo, which only recently regained its No. 3 spot globally. But Taiwan's most recognized global brand will still be a distant third behind Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc. "This will now bring Lenovo and Acer into head-to-head competition globally," said IDC analyst Kitty Fok. "And if Acer manages to acquire both Gateway and Packard Bell, this will help it maintain third place in the world once it reaches it." Lenovo declined to comment. The company, one of a handful of Chinese firms trying to forge a global brand by investing abroad, said in early August that it was in exclusive talks to buy Packard Bell, valued at around $800 million. The latest development may mean that Lenovo has to think of other ways to break deeper into Europe, analysts said. "Lenovo will have to go back to what they were doing earlier, which is build their own distribution channels. It's taking away their easy entry into the European market," said Jenny Lai, a Taiwan-based analyst with CLSA. Packard Bell could not be reached for comment. It is a relatively small player, No. 18 worldwide.
