 LOS ANGELES, August 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Oscar-nominated film star Owen Wilson, best known for comedies like `Wedding Crashers', sought time on Monday to `heal in private' after media reports claimed he was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. "I respectfully ask that the media allow me to receive care and heal in private during this difficult time," Wilson, 38, said in a statement released to Reuters. A fire department official in Santa Monica, California, a beachside community adjacent to Los Angeles, told Reuters that late on Sunday firemen and police officers went to Wilson's home and transported a person to a local hospital where he was treated. The official declined to name Wilson. Various news reports said Wilson was transferred to Cedars Sinai Medical Center in the Beverly Hills area, but hospital officials declined to comment, citing confidentiality. Celebrity magazine People reported Wilson's brother Luke, who is also an actor, and other family members were seen at Cedars Sinai. US tabloids Star magazine and National Enquirer cited unnamed sources as saying Wilson tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrist and taking drugs. Star said he was discovered by a family member, who called for help. Wilson's spokeswoman, Ina Treciokas, declined to elaborate on the actor's statement or discuss his medical condition. COMEDY ACTOR, SERIOUS WRITER Wilson, with long blonde hair and a crooked nose, is known for playing charming rascals, mostly in comedies. In `Wedding Crashers', which grossed $285 million at global box offices, he and co-star Vince Vaughn portrayed two guys who show up uninvited at weddings in order to get dates. The Texas-born actor recently starred in romantic comedy `You, Me and Dupree' playing a guy who moves into the home of his best friend and wreaks havoc on his friend's marriage. Wilson also has a serious side as a co-writer with his long-time friend, director Wes Anderson. The two paired up for 1994's low-budget film `Bottle Rocket', about a trio of hapless friends who turn to crime only to find out it's not too cool. Wilson and Anderson were nominated for a best original screenplay Oscar with 2002's offbeat comedy `The Royal Tenenbaums', about a dysfunctional family. The actor stars in Anderson's new film, `The Darjeeling Limited', premiering at the Venice Film Festival next week. Wilson's career has varied widely and included independent films and big-budget movies like `Starsky and Hutch', a remake of the 1970's TV show. He also had a small role in recent hit `Night at the Museum' and was the voice of a car in animated `Cars
