 NEW YORK, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venus Williams broke the U.S. Open record for fastest women's serve with a 129 mph bullet as she blasted past Hungarian qualifier Kira Nagy 6-2 6-1 in the first round on Monday. The Wimbledon champion, looking to win back-to-back grand slam titles, overpowered the 29-year-old Nagy in just 54 minutes to set up a meeting with Iona Raluca Olaru of Romania. Williams said she was surprised at hitting 129 during her first service game to tie the speed she reached at Wimbledon earlier this season as the fastest ever at a grand slam. "I didn't realise it," said Williams, a six-times grand slam winner gunning for her third U.S. Open crown. "I was so excited because I wasn't even trying. It just comes. That's just how it comes." The previous U.S. Open record was 125 mph set by Williams at the 2004 tournament. "I'm not really trying. It's so exciting. I was very excited. I wasn't expecting to do that at all. I guess I got to try for one more, 130," she said. ROUSING TRIBUTE Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands hit a 130 mph serve in the qualifying event in Cincinnati last year, considered to be the record by the WTA. Williams took the court about an hour later than scheduled for the opening night session after waiting for a rousing tribute to Althea Gibson, marking the 50th anniversary of her becoming the first African-American to win the U.S. Nationals. "Well, it was definitely a tough act to follow in a way," said Williams, 27, who was followed onto the court by her sister, eight-times grand slam winner Serena Williams. "Just watching the whole hour of entertainment, the whole story, I got to be part of the story, too, it was really moving," added Williams, whose taped interview about Gibson was included in the program of music, film and speeches. "It's like, okay, Williams can't lose tonight. That's not part of the plan. It's supposed to be an all-American win tonight.
