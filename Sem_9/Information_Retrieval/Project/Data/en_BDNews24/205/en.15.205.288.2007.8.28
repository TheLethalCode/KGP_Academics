 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Monday pressed charges against six people, including Orion Group chairman Obaidul Karim, of embezzling Tk 6.8 crore from Oriental Bank. The charges come approximately seven months after the government imposed freezes on the troubled bank. It is alleged that Obaidul, one of the bank's sponsors, misappropriated the money with the assistance of some bank officials, including former Oriental Bank chief Koyes Sami. It is further alleged that Obaidul opened a fake account at Oriental's main branch with the help of his co-accused. According to the chargesheet, the bank later issued an illegal inter-branch debit advice and credited the embezzled money to the fake account. Also accused in the case are two former vice presidents of Oriental Bank: Shah Md Harun and Abul Kashem Mahmudullah. Two former assistant vice presidents, Md Fazlur Rahman and AKM Neyamatullah, and bank executive Rafiqul Islam have also been charged. The chargesheet also shows two further individuals whose potential involvement came to light after the ACC's investigation. The case was filed with Motijheel Police Station on Feb 1. bdnews24.com
