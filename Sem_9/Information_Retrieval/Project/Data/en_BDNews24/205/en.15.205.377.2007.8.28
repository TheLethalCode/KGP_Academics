 ANKARA, Tue Aug 28, (bdnews243.com/Reuters) - Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is set to be elected Turkey's next president on Tuesday, the first time in the secular but predominantly Muslim country's modern history that the post will go to a former Islamist. Gul has established himself as a respected diplomat since his AK Party was first elected in 2002, securing the launch of Turkey's European Union entry talks. He pledges to be a leader for all Turks, but he is not to the taste of a military which suspects the AK Party of harboring a secret Islamist agenda. Armed forces chief General Yasar Buyukanit said on Monday he saw "centers of evil" seeking to undermine the secular republic, a statement suggesting the army would not stand on the sidelines if it saw the separation between Mosque and state threatened. "It is clear that the statement of the army includes warnings against any anti-secular action that could come from the government," said Ozgur Altug, a Raymond James economist. Turkish financial markets were under pressure following the army statement, with the lira trading at 1.3230 against the dollar, softer than its Monday close of 1.3150. Gul is set to win the third round of voting starting at 8 a.m. EDT when the AK Party only needs an absolute majority to secure the post. In the previous two rounds in the chamber they failed because a two-thirds majority was required. The AK Party has 341 seats in the 550-seat chamber. Two other candidates are standing for president. The secular elite and Turkey's generals, who have ousted four governments since 1960, are wary of Gul's Islamist past and alarmed at the prospect of a woman, his wife, wearing the Islamic headscarf in the Cankaya presidential palace. "Insidious plans are being made," read the headline in the secularist Cumhuriyet daily, highlighting the army statement. The headscarf is for many a potent symbol of the religious influence soldier-turned-politician Mustafa Kemal Ataturk banished from public life when he founded the modern Western-style republic on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. But a survey by the KONDA agency conducted for Milliyet newspaper showed that 72.6 percent of participants regarded it as 'normal' for the wife of the president to wear a headscarf, while 19.8 percent said they would be uncomfortable about this. Turkey has been mired in political turmoil since April when the AK Party first nominated Gul as their candidate. The crisis sparked early parliamentary elections. Appointing Gul marks a sweet victory for the Islamist-rooted AK Party. It completes their capture of all top state institutions in the NATO-member country. "Cankaya, which some now claim has fallen, does not belong to this or that group or a certain elitist group, but to the 70 million (Turks)," Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week. In Turkey, the government holds most power but the president can veto laws and appointments of officials, and name judges. The post carries moral weight as it was first held by Ataturk. Erdogan and Gul say they are loyal to the secular system and that their party's July landslide win, with 47 percent of the vote, gives foreign minister Gul a strong presidential mandate. Few expect the army to intervene directly after their strong public statements earlier this year appeared to backfire and helped secure more votes for the AK Party in July elections. "The army is back in the barracks but its soldiers are still keeping guard and remain on the lookout," said professor Dogu Ergil of Ankara Universi
