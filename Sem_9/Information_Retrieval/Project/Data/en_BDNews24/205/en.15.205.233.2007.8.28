 TAIPEI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to drop its plan for a referendum on UN membership, branding it a worrying step towards formal independence from China. "When it comes to this issue of a referendum as to whether or not Taiwan joins the United Nations in the name of Taiwan, we do have great concerns," Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said in an interview with Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.

Repeated attempts by Taiwan to join the United Nations have failed in the past decade, but the DPP hopes the referendum will remind voters that the island's diplomatic isolation is due to what it regards as bullying by Beijing -- and that the opposition favours closer economic ties with China. The United Nations, which ousted Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1971 under a "one China" policy, rejected the island's most recent bid last month. Taiwan stands virtually no chance as China is a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council. Negroponte called on Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, a key supporter of the referendum and of greater independence, to honour his "commitments" to maintaining the Taiwan-China status quo, including the island's current name, Republic of Chi
