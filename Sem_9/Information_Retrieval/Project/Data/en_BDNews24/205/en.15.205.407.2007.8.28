<TITLE> Malawian official to assess Madonna over adoption </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LILONGWE, August 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An official appointed by a Malawi court to assess whether Madonna and her husband would be suitable parents for the child they are seeking to adopt said on Monday he will visit the couple in Britain next month. "There has been a change of mind by my government minister and she has allowed me to leave for the UK on September 4 and I am expected to spend two weeks," Penstone Kilembe, who had been refused permission to travel to Britain, told Reuters. Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie's attempts to adopt David Banda hit a snag earlier this month when the Malawian minister of women and child development refused to grant Kilembe permission to travel to Britain to assess their suitability.

Kilembe dismissed the suggestions he asked the pop star for a ticket. "What we had with the minister was just a misunderstanding and that has been resolved. Madonna herself has been informed about the new proposed dates because she has been looking forward to this so that her adoption process is not hampered," he said. Rights groups have accused Madonna of using her fame and wealth to circumvent the country's adoption rules, but the singer has insisted she is following the law. The High Court of Malawi appointed Kilembe to travel to Britain twice and was to have relied on his testimony in ruling whether Madonna should adopt the child in a hearing next year. Madonna took David Banda from Malawi last October when he was 13-months old after his father, Yohane Banda, had placed him in an orphanage following the death of his wife. Justin Dzonzi, a child rights lawyer, told Reuters he was happy that the minister had rescinded her decision.
