 KERBALA, Iraq, August 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pilgrims gathered peacefully in Iraq's holy city of Kerbala on Tuesday to mark one of the holiest days of the Shia calendar after clashes between pilgrims and police overnight killed at least six people. Police said they opened fire on a large crowd of pilgrims infuriated by strict security measures in force in the southern city for the celebrations, killing six people and wounding 22. One of the dead was a woman. The shots were fired after the pilgrims began pelting police and their cars with stones and other objects, police said. The violence erupted on one of the main streets leading to Kerbala's revered Imam Hussein shrine. Saleem Kadhim, spokesman for Kerbala's Health Directorate, said the local hospital had received five bodies and 30 wounded early on Tuesday. All were pilgrims -- some had been shot while others appeared to have been beaten to death. Kadhim Mohammed, a media official in the local office of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is a powerful political force in the city, said he had counted eight bodies and 40 wounded at the hospital. He said four of the dead were Sadr supporters. A Reuters photographer saw one pilgrim shot dead outside his hotel. He said sounds of gunfire echoed in the streets for about two hours late on Monday. IMAM'S BIRTHDAY After the fighting ended, scores of police, some armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and heavy machineguns, were seen patrolling the city in a show of force to prevent further eruptions of violence. Reuters journalists said on Tuesday the city appeared calm and pilgrims were carrying out their rituals. Iraq's security forces are on heightened alert during the two-day celebrations, fearing that Sunni Islamist al Qaeda will try to launch a large-scale attack on civilians. US officials fear the group wants to play a spoiling role to influence a pivotal report on military and political progress in Iraq, due to be presented to the US Congress in two weeks' time. Shia pilgrimages have been a target of Sunni bombers and have also served as rallying events for the Shia majority, now running Iraq after decades under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni Arab. Some 10,000 police officers and 5,000 Iraqi soldiers had been deployed in the city. Vehicles have been banned from its precincts and pilgrims are body-searched before entering. The pilgrims are celebrating the 9th century birth of Muhammad al-Mahdi, the last of 12 imams Shias revere as saints and who they believe never died and will return to save mankind. Pilgrims from Baghdad and other Shia towns have been converging on Kerbala, mostly on foot, in the past few days. The pilgrimage so far has been largely peaceful, although one pilgrim was shot and six wounded by gunmen in the towns of Iskandariya and Latifiya on Monday.
