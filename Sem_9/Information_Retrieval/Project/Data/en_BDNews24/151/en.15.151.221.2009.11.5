 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)BATEXPO 2009, the country's largest garments export fair, kicked off on Thursday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the annual three-day expo, hosted by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, at Sonargaon Hotel at around 11am. Finance minister AMA Muhith, commerce minister Faruq Khan and LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam also attended the Inaugural programme. BGMEA's first vice president Nasir Uddin Chowdhury gave the welcome address at the function presided over by its chief Abdus Salam Murshedi. Murshedi told a news conference Wednesday on the eve of the fair: "Exports have fallen due to the global recession. At the same time, prices also went down. In this situation we are staging this fair with great expectation to boost exports." But he sounded an optimistic note: "The recession is fading away gradually." "Demands for ready-made clothing will increase. BATEXPO should help revive the market." Murshedi said a larger number of foreign buyers are participating the BATEXPO fair this year. "Our primary goal is to expand the market of ready-made clothing in view of the fading recession," he said. According to BGMEA, 62 companies are participating this year's BATEXPO fair, many from UK, USA, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. There are some 86 stalls at the fair on the sideline of which a cultural night and fashion show would be held as part of the BATEXPO tradition. The closing ceremony of the fair will be held on Friday evening, even though the fair ends on Saturday. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia will be chief guest at the closing function. The three-day knitwear exposition, KNITEXPO 2009, organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, ended on Wednesday. b
