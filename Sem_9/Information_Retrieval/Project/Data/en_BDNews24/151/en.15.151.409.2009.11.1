 Bagerhat, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Coastguards on Saturday night rescued 46 people, including 29 children, who had been forced to work for no pay, at Meher Alir Char in Bagerhat, an official said on Sunday. Meher Alir Char is situated under Dublar Char of the Sundarbans East Division, Sharankhola Range in Bagerhat. Mongla Coastguards, western zone commander Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com that they also captured five Bahaddar-- Ramiz Uddin, 25, Ratan Das, 24, Ayub Khan, 45, Ananda Das, 20, and Abdul Shukur, 55-- at 8pm. A Bahaddar seasonally deals in dried fish. They were handed over to Mongla Police Station but no case has yet been filed, Islam said. The captured men had been 'forcefully' employing them at Shutkir Chatal (a place where dried fishes are processed) of Dublar Char, Islam said. The rescued men have been kept in Chalna Port Secondary School in Mongla. The rescued people alleged that they had been taken there by brokers with temptation for better wages. One of the rescued men, Kishore Sagor, said he had travelled to his grandfather's house a month ago in Pirojpur where he had been introduced to a broker. The broker had taken him there with the promise of a job to peel off heads of shrimps . But, Sagor alleged, he had to work there from 6am to 3am, cooking, washing and fetching water. He had not been paid for the last month, he also said. Another rescued man from Sunamganj, Ruhul Amin, said he had been taken to a fishermen's village in Dublar Char to work there for 'three to five days'. But, he had been forced to do many odd jobs since then, he also said. bdn
