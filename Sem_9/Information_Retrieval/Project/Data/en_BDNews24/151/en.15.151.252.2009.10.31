 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Tamim Iqbal scored a scintillating half-century as Bangladesh posted a four-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the third one-day international at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Saturday. The Bangladesh opener hit 80 off 72 balls as hosts reached 198-6 in 40.4 overs to go 2-1 ahead in the five-match series. He featured in a 98-run second wicket stand Mohammad Ashraful, who made 63. They came together after the home side lost Junaed Siddique early in the run chase. Tamim's breezy knock featured 10 fours and two sixes. He eventually gave his wicket away attempting to loft spinner Graeme Cremer but only succeeded in getting stumped. He was later named man-of-the-match. Ashraful then added 53 runs with Raqibul Hasan (21) before he was bowled by Ray Price while shaping up to cut the ball. His 91-ball knock contained seven fours and a six. The hosts lost two quick wickets in the batting powerplay, but it was too little to late to stop Shakib Al Hasan's men from reaching their target. In the post match ceremony, acting Zimbabwe skipper Hamilton Masakadza said: "We were below par with batting and kept losing wickets at regular intervals. We need to work on our batting and we played the spinners well today but we needed to be more decisive." His Bangladesh counterpart Shakib: "We tried a few experiments, which did not work. We will try it some other time. If we play to our merits we will win as these are our home conditions. Whenever the top-order scores runs it becomes easier for the middle order." Tamim: " I am not happy because I did not go on to get the century and did not finish my job. The boys are really working hard and I am happy with the team's progress. On any given day, the team that plays better cricket will win the match." Earlier, Bangladesh, led by their band of spinners, restricted the visitors to 196 in 41.1 overs. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr celebrated his inclusion with 3-45. He was ably supported by paceman Nazmul Hossain with three for 13 while slow left-armer Abdur Razzak took 2-41. It was Enamul's double strike in the 15th over that began the Zimbabwean slide after the Tigers won the toss. Zimbabwe lost their last six wickets for 48 runs after top-scorer Hamilton Masakadza's superb 84 off 79 balls. The other batsmen to reach double digits were Charles Coventry (29), Malcolm Waller (27) and Elton Chigumbura, who was the last wicket to go for 20. Mahmudullah and Naeem Islam picked up a wicket each. Bangladesh won the second game by seven wickets after the visitors coasted to a five-wicket victory in the series opener. Both teams now move to Chittagong for the fourth ODI on Nov 3 it will also host the final match two days la
