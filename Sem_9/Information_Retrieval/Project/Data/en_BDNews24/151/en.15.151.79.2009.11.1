<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Regulatory Reforms Commission will be replaced by resuscitating Bangladesh Better Business Forum, said finance minister MA Muhith Sunday. The finance minister said this to reporters after his meeting Sunday noon with a delegation headed by the International Finance Corporation vice president Rachel Kyte. A task force will be constituted for scrutinizing the BBBF recommendations, he assured. About the RRC, Muhith said, "How can the RRC sustain without its chairman? But we'll reconstitute the BBBF. The revamping has already taken off." To review and update old laws and regulations, the caretaker government in 2007 had constituted the 17-member RRC with Akbar Ali Khan as its head. But Khan resigned from his office as the RRC chairman on Oct 15 on the plea that the incumbent government was not cooperating with him. The 37-member BBBF was formed in September 2007 with the chief adviser of the caretaker government Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed as its head. Many of the BBBF recommendations have already been implemented. The finance minister also said, the BBBF reorganisation will be accomplished in a few days and a task force will be constituted to scrutinize the forum's recommendations. "The government will next implement the specific recommendations forwarded by the task force," he said. On his meeting with the IFC vice president, Muhith said, the organisation has expressed interest in investing in the small and medium enterprises, communication and power sectors. Besides, IFC was also eager to invest in public-private partnership implementation and in setting up special economic zones at different places, he said.
