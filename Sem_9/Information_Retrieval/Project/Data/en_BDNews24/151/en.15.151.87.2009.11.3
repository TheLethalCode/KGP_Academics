 CHITTAGONG, Nov 3 (bdnews34.com/Reuters)--Bangladesh dismissed Zimbabwe for just 44 runs before easing to a six-wicket victory and an unassailable 3-1 lead in their five-match one-day international series on Tuesday. Pacer Nazmul Hossain and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak shared two wickets apiece to reduce the visitors to 8-4, a position from which Zimbabwe could never recover. The home side's bowlers demolished Zimbabwe for 44, the fifth lowest total in one-dayers. Left-arm spinners Enamul Haque Jr and Shakib Al Hasan took over as chief tormentors, grabbing three wickets each to bowl out Zimbabwe, who had won the toss and opted to bat, for the lowest total by any team against Bangladesh. Hong Kong held the previous mark of 105 in a 2004 Asia Cup match in Colombo. Bangladesh were on course for a first 10-wicket victory at 33 without loss before Zimbabwe snared four wickets in quick succession on a batting surface that provided sharp turn for the spin bowlers. But the familiar top-order blip could not stop Bangladesh from taking the series by knocking off the runs in 11.5 overs. Raymond Price and Graeme Cremer each claimed two wickets for Zimbabwe before middle-order batsman Roqibul Hassan finished the match with a huge off six over long to take the hosts to 49-4 in 11.5 overs. The final match of the series will be held at the same venue on Thursday
