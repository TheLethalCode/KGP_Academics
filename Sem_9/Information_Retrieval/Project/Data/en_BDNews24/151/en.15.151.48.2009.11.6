<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina left for Bhutan on Friday on a three-day visit eyeing increased trade with the landlocked country. This is the first visit of PM to a South Asian country after she took office in January. Foreign minister Dipu Moni had previously said that a trade agreement will be signed during the visit. Hasina is leading a 28-member delegation which includes Moni, commerce minister Faruq Khan and industries minister Dilip Barua. She is to meet with her Bhutanese counterpart Jigme Thinley on Saturday. The delegation left Dhaka on a Druk Air flight around 1:15pm. Cabinet members and high civil and military officials saw her off at the Zia International Airport. The prime minister is scheduled to come back on Nov 9. The volume of Bangladesh-Bhutan trade is very small. Dhaka imports commodities, mainly fruit and fruit-products, worth $14 million a year, while it exports less than $1 million, according to commerce ministry. The foreign minister on Thursday said the two countries will discuss transit through India during Hasina's visit to the tiny mountain nation, but are not expected to sign a deal just yet. The foreign minister also said Dhaka would try to "be involved" in the hydro-power projects in Bhutan to meet Bangladesh's increasing energy needs. Bhutan signed a transit agreement in 1980 to boost bilateral trade but could not establish transit facilities between the two countries as Bangladesh and India could not reach agreement on the issue. Bangladesh and Bhutan will have to cross a 50-kilometre stretch of Indian land to reach each other's territories. India, meanwhile, has long been demanding transit facilities from Dhaka to reach its seven states in its North East separated by Bangladesh. India, during Moni's Delhi visit in September, offered Bangladesh passage to reach Bhutan and Nepal subject to securing separate transit deals with Thimpu and Katmandu. bdnew
