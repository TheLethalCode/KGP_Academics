 Dhaka, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni Monday urged oil exporting countries to give Bangladesh special concession in fuel prices. The minister, now in Malaysia, made the request while addressing a summit of the D8 council of ministers in Kuala Lumpur. "On energy cooperation, Dipu Moni proposed the oil exporting countries of the grouping to consider providing special concession in fuel prices to mitigate the adverse affects of the current global economic crisis faced by Bangladesh," said a foreign ministry press statement. She also proposed cooperation on improving technologies pertaining to renewable energy production, including solar energy, said the statement. Referring to spiralling food prices in 2007 and 2008, the foreign minister emphasised greater cooperation in agriculture for achieving sustainable farming and food security for the D8 countries.
