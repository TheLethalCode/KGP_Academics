<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Andre Agassi should be punished for taking banned substances and then lying to tennis officials about it, International Olympic Committee member Sergei Bubka said on Friday. Bubka said action should be taken against the American despite the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) eight-year statute of limitations.

"There is a moment of regret, followed by vast sadness. Then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head. I've never felt so alive, so hopeful -- and I've never felt such energy." Bubka acknowledged that Agassi got away with it before the existence of WADA which was formed two years later. "We are much better since the creation of WADA. We are better because we engage governments and I see more progress than negative points.
