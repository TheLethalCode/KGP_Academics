 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Monday upheld controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun's bail granted by the High Court in four extortion cases. He will not be released from detention in prison anytime soon, though, as more cases against are pending. A six-member Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin Monday rejected the government's appeal to overturn the bail order and cancelled the Appellate Division chamber judge's order to stay the bail. Meantime, a regular Appellate Division bench headed by the chief justice has extended the efficacy of Mamun's bail stay in a tax dodge case until Thursday. Mamun got bail in four extortion cases on Oct 8 and on Oct 11 the Appellate Division chamber judge stayed the bail order and ordered the government to file a regular appeal within the period. After the court order, Mamun's counsel Rafique Ul Haque told bdnews24.com, "This Appellate Division order has upheld Mamun's bail order." Additional attorney general AKM Jahirul Haque representing the government said at the hearing, "There are specific allegations of extortion against Mamun. He collected cash by threatening to kill people." On Jan 30, 2007 the joint forces arrested Mamun, who is known as former prime minster Khaleda Zia's son Tarique's friend and business partner. bdne
