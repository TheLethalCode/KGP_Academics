<TITLE> House to debate TIFA: Faruque </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The government will only sign a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the United States if the country's interests are protected, and after the issue is debated in parliament, the commerce minister said on Saturday. Minister Faruque Khan was addressing a discussion, marking the 30th anniversary of Bangladesh Indenting Agents Association, when ICCIB president Mahbubur Rahman prompted him to talk over the contentious TIFA issue with the business community. "The government will decide on TIFA only if the important issues, like labour policy, investment and climate change are settled," Khan said. Mahbubur Rahman, International Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bangladesh president, said, "TIFA, as a trade framework agreement, must be discussed with the business community and others concerned to ensure country's interests are protected, before any deal is signed." Rahman said consensus needed to be built too on other issues, including WTO negotiations. He said trade and commerce also faced various crises and constraints due to lack of proper policies and adverse socio-political situation. He called on the government to come forward to formulate business-friendly policies and guidelines in the crucial spheres of trade, commerce and business. The US assistant trade representative Michael J Delaney on a recent visit pushed for signing a TIFA with his country to increase bilateral trade. Delaney said though the US was the number one trading partner with Bangladesh, there lacked a "formal dialogue mechanism" to discuss issues related with expansion of trade and investment. Foreign secretary Mijarul Quayes, after a meeting with Delaney on Oct 19, told bdnews24.com the government was "examining the TIFA". Signing a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with US is a controversial issue in Bangladesh, considered as an agreement that would benefit the more powerful country. Last year Bangladesh exported products, mainly ready-made garments and shrimp, worth over $3 billon to the US, while the latter imported products worth about $500 million. Many are particularly concerned that Bangladesh would be in weaker position in the multilateral forums on trade liberalisation like the WTO if it signs a TIFA with the US. The US government during the tenure of the past caretaker government in Bangladesh sent a draft TIFA for consideration. But the interim administration finally refrained from signing the controversial deal amid criticisms. The US has already signed TIFAs with 56 countries in the world. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are the two other South Asian countries to sign such agreements with the US. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has appointed lobbyists in the US Congress for the passage of a bill which would give her duty-free and quota-free market access to the US. It also plans to push for DFQF access to other major markets for developing countries, as head of the LDC Group in upcoming WTO talks. bd
