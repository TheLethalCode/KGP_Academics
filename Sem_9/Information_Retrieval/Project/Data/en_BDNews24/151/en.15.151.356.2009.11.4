 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given the CID police another three days to question Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid, daughter of retired Lt Col Khandaker Abdur Rashid, a death convict in president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case. Detective police arrested Mehnaz on Oct 24 at her Gulshan house in the case regarding the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Second metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui made the order on Wednesday rejecting the remand prayer for six more days by assistant commissioner of police Akbar Hossain, also the investigation officer in the case. Mehnaz was earlier remanded for nine days in two phases. Mehnaz's lawyers Abu Salim Chowdhury, Helal Uddin Ahmed and Kazi Shafiqur Rahman appealed for rejection of the remand appeal and granting her bail. The remand petition said evidence and testimonies established that Mehnaz had links with the suspects and the detained connected to Taposh murder attempt. Moreover, vital information on the Aug 15, 1975 killings of independence hero -Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were also elicited from her. Kamrul Haque Swapan, the brother of self-confessed killer Shariful Haque Dalim and another fugitive convict, was arrested on Oct 22 following the bomb attack on Taposh the previous day. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were also murdered on Aug 15, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21 night. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. Taposh alleged the next day that the attack was made upon him to derail the appeals process in the Supreme Court. He filed a case with Motijheel Police Station earlier in the day, mentioning no names, but alleging that the relatives and associates of those convicted of the Aug 15 killings were involved in the attack. The case details said they carried out the attack in a premeditated manner to kill him in order to disrupt the final outcome of the trial of the killers of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib. b
