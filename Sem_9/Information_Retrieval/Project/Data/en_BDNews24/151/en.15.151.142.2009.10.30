 Chapainawabganj, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Transport owners and workers in Chapainawabganj called off an indefinite strike Thursday night. They reached an agreement to bring buses back on the road after a meeting with the deputy commissioner. Tajul Islam, general secretary of Chapainawabganj Bus Owners Association, told reporters after the meeting they lifted the strike at 8pm as they received an assurance from the DC to meet their seven-point demand. The demands include, among others, keeping BRTC buses off their routes and banning 'illegal' vehicles such as Nasimans and Karimans, locally assembled three-wheelers used for public transport. Deputy commissioner KM Ali Azam said most of their demands had been accepted, except the stoppage of BRTC buses as only higher authorities could decide that. He said Nasimans, Karimans and Bhatbhatis could run on highways to carry farm products. But those vehicles would not be allowed to carry passengers or run in towns. The transport strike, called on Wednesday, had resumed on Thursday morning severing road communication between the northern district and the rest of the country for the second day. All buses, except of BRTC, stayed off the roads. Police were deployed at different points of the town as striking bus workers were seen picketing at different road crossings. Transport Owners Association president Aminul Islam Sentu told bdnews24.com on Wednesday they would expand their strike in all 16 districts of the northern region if their demands were not met within two days. bdn
