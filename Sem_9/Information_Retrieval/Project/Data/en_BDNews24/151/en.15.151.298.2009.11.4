 MADRID, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Didier Drogba scored twice on his Champions League return to lead Chelsea to a 2-2 draw at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday which sealed the London club's place in the knockout stages with two games to spare. There were few chances in the first hour at the Calderon although Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech had to dive full length to palm away a curling shot from former Arsenal winger Jose Antonio Reyes in the 20th minute. Drogba, back in European action after a three-match suspension, also came close when Atletico keeper Sergio Asenjo deflected his effort on to the post just after the break. Atletico had not scored in this season's Champions League, including a 4-0 drubbing at Chelsea last month, but went ahead after 66 minutes thanks to a spectacular strike from substitute Sergio Aguero. John Terry's headed clearance looped up to the Argentina forward and he smashed a volley past Cech from 15 metres. Drogba, on his 50th Champions League appearance for the Londoners, equalised by heading in a Florent Malouda cross in the 82nd minute. The Ivory Coast striker then raced through the defence to give Chelsea the lead six minutes later, firing in at the second attempt after Asenjo blocked his first effort. Aguero, who had replaced the ineffective Florent Sinama Pongolle after 54 minutes, capped a fine performance with a curling free kick to level for Atletico in the final minute. Porto's 1-0 win at APOEL Nicosia meant the Portuguese team and Group D leaders Chelsea both went through. Atletico, third with two points from four games, can still claim a spot in the Europa League.
