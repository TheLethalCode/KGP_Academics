 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government has begun investigations into sources of terrorist and militant financing in Bangladesh, said a government official on Thursday. The prime minister's adviser on social development, Alauddin Ahmed, said the government was firmly resolved in finding "the godfathers behind terrorism". "We are now looking into the sources of terrorist financing. We will investigate and find who are involved. It could well be by NGOs. The godfathers will be searched out," he told reporters after attending a discussion on 'Good Governance in the NGO Sector' at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. He said no specific NGO was under suspicion, the government was looking at the sector as a whole as well as all other possible sources of terrorist funds. "If a source is proven, necessary steps will be taken against the individual or organisation." "Dire consequences face us if terrorist financing is not stopped," he said during the earlier discussion. "Already we are facing turmoil on this account." The prime minister's adviser said, along with the government, all parties needed to take initiatives to solve problems and establish good governance in the NGO sector. "The government is honestly trying to ensure transparency and accountability in this sector," he said. He revealed plans to give more power to the government's NGO Bureau. "The manpower of this bureau will have to be increasednot to hamper NGO activities, but to give administrative support." "At the same time it is needed to monitor NGO activities and ensure accountability." He said the NGO bureau is currently working with just 70 staff countrywide. "There are 2,333 national and 217 international NGO registered in the country." Abdur Rob, assistant director of Bangladesh Bank, presented a paper titled 'An overview on financing of extremists: Vulnerability of the NGO sector'. He said nearly 60,000 NGO work in Bangladesh, with only a fraction being registered. He said there is a vacuum at the central level in registration and monitoring of NGOs. He also suggested forming a national committee to analyse the financing of terrorists. He also gave examples of Bangladesh Bank's activities under the Antiterrorist Act 2009. Economist Wahiduddin Mahmud said, "Bangladesh is rich with NGOs. But there is a lack in NGOs' economic clarity and good governance." He also said, "Criticising the NGO sector as a whole is not right. If NGOs are removed through strictness of law, religious fascism might move in to fill the gap." NGO Bureau secretary general Mustak Hasan Mohammed Iftekhar, Transperency International Bangladesh chairman M Hafizuddin Khan, Ain o Salish Kendra executive director Sultana Kamal, and others spoke at the discussion chaired by Dhaka deputy commissioner Khandaker Shawkat Hossein. The meeting was organised by the NGO Bureau, BRAC, Manusher Jonne, OXFAM and TIB. bd
