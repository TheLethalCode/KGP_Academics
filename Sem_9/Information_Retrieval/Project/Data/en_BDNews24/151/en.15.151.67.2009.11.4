 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid apologised Wednesday for using "un-parliamentary words" in the House on Oct 11, and deleted them from the record. Hamid also termed jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui statement about the speaker on Oct 12 "against the Rules of Procedure" and expunged it from the proceedings of the House. "On Oct 11, I saw only the prime minister in the front bench. I could not take the senior ministers' absence easily," Hamid said Wednesday, ruling on the minister's comment. "I think even the prime minister was embarrassed by their absence. "Therefore, I uttered two words as a metaphor to bring disciplines in the House and ensure presence of the ministers. "I am sorry for it. The two words will be expunged from the proceedings," said Hamid. Hamid had said on the day that he could not take the absence of the senior ministers easily, and in an outburst said the chamber sounded like a "fish market", as some MPs were chatting on the floor while others were speaking in violation of the Rules of Procedure. The speaker also said Wednesday that any minister could issue statements on important public matters under rule 300 of the Rules of Procedure. But Abdul Latif Siddiqui, he said, made a statement on Oct 12 other than important issues involving his ministry. Latif Siddiqui in his statement had criticised Abdul Hamid and said, "The speaker is a servant, not the master of the House". Hamid in his ruling Wednesday said, "There is no provision in the rules of procedure to make such a statement. So, the minister's statement will be expunged from the proceedings of the House." The MPs thanked the speaker by thumbing desks. Deputy Speaker Shawkat Ali recorded the statement under rule 300 of the Rules of Procedure. Abdul Hamid urged all to work within their jurisdictions and not encroach others areas.
