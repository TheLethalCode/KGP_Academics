<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Micro credit plays a vital role in expanding the economic activities in the country, the PKSF chief said on Thursday. "With expanding micro credit coverage across the country, the missing middle is shrinking," said Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud, chairman of Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, the apex body for micro-finance institutions. Speaking at a press conference, at the National Press Club, to announce the 'City Small Entrepreneurs Awards 2009'. "Such encouraging efforts on the part of the government, its development partners and international organisations will usher in hopeful opportunities for the small and scattered entrepreneurs," he said. Highlighting the laudable role of small entrepreneurs in overcoming huge hurdles, Dr Mahmud said, with the help of micro credit, they were lifting the nation's economy and rasing themselves from the plight of the 'missing middle', or those who do not have access to bank loans or government credit. CitiBank NA country officer Mamun Rashid said, "This award is given not only to acknowledge the efforts of the small entrepreneurs in setting up small industries, but also to encourage the small financial organisations in boosting the national economy." The awards, being endowed for the fifth year, will be handed over in March 2010 to four winners in four specific economic activity zones, and are worth Tk 3.5 lakh each. After receiving nominations from across the country, the award advisory council and the selection committee will finalise the winners before handing them over in March, Rashid said. CitiBank and Shakti Foundation for Disadvantaged Women jointly sponsor the awards. Former finance secretary Siddiqur Rahman Chowdhury, NGO Bureau director general Mustaque Hasan Mohammad Iftekhar and Shakti executive director Humaira Islam were present. bdn
