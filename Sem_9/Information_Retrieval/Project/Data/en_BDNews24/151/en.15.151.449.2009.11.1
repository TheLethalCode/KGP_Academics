 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)--Police on Sunday claimed another man died from wounds in Saturday's riot in Tongi, amid allegations that the law-enforcers had concealed bodies of victims. The death of Tajul Islam, 50, a mason and resident of Ershadnagar, took the death tolls in the incident to three. Khokan, the son of the deceased, identified him on Sunday. While he was brought to the hospital, police did not confirm that he was injured in the Tongi clashes. Authorities finally confirmed the casualties almost 12 hours after the deaths of Babul Sheikh and Shafiqul Islam were first reported by the media on Saturday. Shahbagh Police Station's sub-inspector Ataur Rahman told bdnews24.com Tajul had died in Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Saturday night. "Tajul was brought to the hospital on Saturday evening. He died there in the night," Rahman said. Shahbagh police cheif Rezaul Karim said Tajul's relatives had identified him. Over 100 were also injured in violent clashes between the police and workers of Nippon Garment Factory. bd
