 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - Former army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed returned to Dhaka from the US on Saturday. He landed on a Gulf Airways flight at around 8pm, immigration chief at Zia International Airport, Md Mominul Islam told bdnews24.com. Moeen, who retired on June 15 this year and left for the US with his wife soon after, faces a defamation suit back in Dhaka by former BNP state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku. Tuku filed the suit on July 12, within days of Moeen leaving for the US. Tuku is claiming Tk 100 crore in damages, for reportedly defamatory statements made against him by the army chief at a reception for freedom fighters in March 2007. Moeen had reportedly said "at least Tk 20,000 crore" was siphoned out of the country from the power sector alone during the BNP's government. Tuku, being BNP state minister for power at the time, is claiming that the statement attacked his reputation. Moeen was appointed army chief in 2005, during the tenure of BNP-Jamaat government; the caretaker administration extended his tenure by a year. bdne
