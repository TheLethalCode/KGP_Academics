<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar has alleged that the Awami League is attempting to commemorate Nov 7 as 'freedom fighter killing day' to make it meaningless. BNP celebrates the day as the 'national revolutionary and solidarity day' and declared it a public holiday when it was in office. In the coup and counter-coup in 1975 following the assassination of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15 that year, deputy chief of army Maj Gen Ziaur Rahman was in temporary detention. On Nov 7, Zia was rescued by a group of soldiers led by Col Abu Taher and went on to become the first chief martial law administrator in the country. Later, Col Taher was handed death sentence in a military trial on charges of sedition. Taher accused Zia of being a traitor during the trial. Delwar claimed the Awami League, not BNP, pursues politics of killing freedom fighters and opposition leaders. "Not BNP, but AL and its Rakkhibahini (dissolved paramilitary force) were responsible for killing freedom fighters and opposition party leaders," he said at a press briefing after the national committee for commemorating the 'national revolutionary and solidarity day' met at Naya Paltan office on Wednesday. "Now Awami League is commemorating the day in a different name in an attempt to taint the day that marks the resistance of the blueprint to establish authoritarianism and expansionism." "Awami League tried to stifle democracy by establishing one-party BAKSAL rule. Ziaur Rahman ended that system and established multi-party democracy. "This is why AL cancelled the Nov 7 holiday when it came to power. Why the former caretaker government did the same is clear to the people now." Delwar said, "Celebrating the day properly is vital considering current political situations. The way Awami League is trying to erase the meaning of the day is nothing but propaganda. It shows their undemocratic mindset." He said this year, BNP and its associate organizations have taken steps to celebrate the day with due importance and splendour all over the country. He urged leaders and workers all over the country to commemorate the day. Another meeting of the committee was held with Mirza Abbas in chair on Oct 19. Joint secretaries general Selima Rahman and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, MP Barkat Ullah Bulu, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and others were at the committee meetin
