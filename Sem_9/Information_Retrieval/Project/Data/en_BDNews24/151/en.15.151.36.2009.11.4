 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)A visiting European Union delegation Tuesday suggested Bangladesh move forward with specific projects to get financial assistance for climate change adpatation. European parliament member Nirij Deva said that the EU is committed to help front liners in the list of worst hit countries. "Bangladesh needs financial assistance as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. But moving forward with specific goals is important to get this assistance," Nirij told a press conference at the Brac Center Inn. "Although we are ready to give Bangladesh all-out support to fight the adverse effects of climate change, we do not want to give any country a blank cheque." Whatever role the US plays in the upcoming Copenhagen Conference on climate changes, the EU will stand by Bangladesh and other developing states, said Nirij, referring to the US's previously uncooperative stance on global agreements for binding emissions cuts. The eight member EU delegation arrived on Oct 31 to discuss food security in the wake of climate change with policy makers. It met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, ministers for environment and disaster management, parliamentarians, NGOs and civil society representatives during its trip. bdn
