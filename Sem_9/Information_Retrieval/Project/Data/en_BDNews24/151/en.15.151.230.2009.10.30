 Faruq Iqbal Chittagong Bureu Chief Chittagong, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)--The terms and conditions of the tender for awarding contract for the operation of Chittagong Container Terminal (CCT) by private entities are being amended. For this, the date for submission of bids in the third tender has been shifted to Nov 5. Two tenders on private handling of the CCT were cancelled in the past. Currently, the CCT operations are run through an understanding between the Chittagong Port Authority and Saif Power Tech at Tk 505 per container without any tender. "According to former schedule, new tenders for the CCT were due for submission on Nov 1. On orders of the shipping ministry, submissions are now to be made on Nov 5," Ehsanul Kabir, director of transport, CPA, told bdnews24.com on Friday. "A number of amendments are being made to the conditions of eligibility to submit tenders so that a larger number of experienced contractors can participate." He refused to go into further details. Port users are worried about strikes and work halts as discontent among port labourers and workers are increasing by the day. Businessmen are speculating about increased cost for container handling at the port due to corruption, bribes and slow work speed. Fazle Ekram Chowdhury, convener of Berth Operators Association (BOA), told bdnews24.com, "The port is reclining back to its previous management system. This will reduce productivity and increase cost for port users." According to him, the contractors, keeping in mind the dissatisfaction of port workers, might increase the handling rate for each container in the new tenders. Officials with the knowledge of the matter said the conditions in the second tender only allowed the port's berth operators to bid. Any contractor, even if experienced, could not submit tenders, calling the transparency into question. According to port users, the work of container handling technically requires complicated and modern methods. It is impossible for anyone to handle the containers fast and accurately without high level of experience. A high official of a private contracting firm, known for their ICD operations, told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity, "No big changes are being brought to the conditions even though the date is being set back." bdnews24.com understands that amendments are being brought only to the conditions of experience and productivity. Contractors with experience of two years and qualifications to handle 2 lakh TUS (20 feet containers are taken as 1 unit) can participate. This condition was not there in the Nov 1 tender conditions. Saif Power Tech was appointed in June, 2006 to handle CCT. In the end of that contract in 2008, tender was floated to appoint new contractor in November. Tender was called again in December. Eshaq Brothers had quoted the lowest price, Tk 340 for handling per container. The ministry approved the work order after accepting the lowest bidder. The CPA signed an agreement with Eshaq on Feb 2, 2009. But on Oct 8, eight months into the signing the deal, it cancelled the contract following the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry. The standing committee recommended cancellation of the contract as allegation was raised, that former shipping adviser to interim administration M A Matin had helped the company get the job through irregularities. The committee claimed that after the Dec 29 general elections, the caretaker government had signed the contract with Eshaq Brothers in a hurry on the eve of its departure. Eshaq on Oct 12 asked for Tk 25 crore in damages for the cancelled contract. In a letter, it also threatened the CPA with legal actions if the money is not paid by 15 days. b
