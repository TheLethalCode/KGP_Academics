<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - Individual icome tax returns will outstrip last year's, the NBR chief said Saturday as the deadline for submissions loomed. The tax offices saw crowds flocking to tax offices that were specially kept open on Saturday. As the Oct 31 deadline falls on a weekend day, Saturday, returns will also be received on the following day. National Board of Revenue chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the deadline would not be extended further under any circumstances. "A huge number have submitted their returns towards the end of deadline. The offices were overflowing with people on Saturday," he said. He said similar numbers are expected to submit their returns on the last day, Sunday. Returns would be received until 8pm, he added. "The tax payers this year will far outnumber the 7.39 lakh of last year," the NBR chief said NBR extended the deadline by one month on Sep 29. The number of TIN holders in the country is over 22 lakh. A total of Tk 13,812.16 crore was earned from individual income tax returns in the last fiscal year while the target for revenue earnings from the sector is Tk 16,500 crore in the current fiscal year. At an event on Sep 15 marking National Income Tax Day, finance minister AMA Muhith said, the government wants the amount to hit Tk 20,000 crore during its tenure. On Oct 28, the NBR chairman announced returns would be received up to Sunday Nov 1 this year as Oct 31 fell on a Saturday and may be inconvenient for people even though tax offices and banks were directed to stay open. Income tax law stipulates that individual tax payers can submit their returns up to September-end, but deadline is invariably extended every year. Last year, the deadline was extended twice to Nov 30. bd
