 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The president and prime minister issued separate messages Monday honouring the memory of four national leaders assassinated in the 1975 Jail Killings. The slain leadersacting president of Bangladesh Syed Nazrul Islam, prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed and ministers M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamruzzamanwere senior figures in the wartime cabinet of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and in the first years of government after independence. They were killed in Dhaka Central Jail on Nov 3 1975, less than three months after Mujib himself was assassinated. "The towering contributions of these four national heroes to an independent Bengali nation will remain etched in history forever," said president Zillur Rahman in his message. "The nation will honour them for acting in the absence of Bangabandhu to form the Mujib Nagar government, leading the liberation forces and wisely guiding the new nation." "The four were murdered ruthlessly in jail after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family to make the country leaderless and endanger the liberty and sovereignty of the country," said the president. "The jail killings are part of a dark chapter of our national history." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in her message, rounded on the "anti-liberation forces" responsible for the killings. "The saboteurs and murderers have kept the country in their grasps for 21 years." "The anti-liberation forces implemented laws to save those self-confessed killers, instead of punishment gave them rewards, and tried to rehabilitate them in politics." She said her Awami League government coming to power in 1996 finally launched the trial of Bangabandhu's murder and the Jail Killings. But, she said, "I want to warn the countrymen that the anti-liberation forces are still in action. They have attacked again and again to destroy pro-democratic and pro-liberation forces in the country." She referred to the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally and the recent bomb attack on Awami League MP Fazle Nur Taposh. Hasina expressed her strong belief that "The people of this country will unite to face all sabotage and for continuance of democracy and law to establish a hunger, poverty and illiteracy free nation by 2021." She ended her message by honouring the four slain leaders. The Awami League government revived the trial of the Jail Killings case after coming to power in 1996. A verdict was announced on Oct 20, 2004 during the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government, sentencing 15 of the 20 accused. Appeals are now pending. Three former army officials were handed down death sentences by hanging and 12 others were awarded life imprisonment. Risalder Mosleh Uddin, Dafader Sharafat Ali and Abul Hossain Mridha were given death sentences. Col (retd) Syed Faruk Rahman, Col (retd) Syed Shahriar Rashid, Major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (removed) Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Lt Col (retd) Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col (retd) MHMB Noor Chowdhury, Major (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed, Lt Col (retd) AM Rashed Chowdhury, Major (retd) Ahmed Shariful Hossain, Captain (retd) Abdul Majed, Captain (sacked) Md Kismat Hossain and Captain (retd) Nazmul Hossain Ansar were sentenced to life in prison.
