<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the owners will have to find out the reason for workers unrest in the readymade garment factories. "No industry can sustain by suppressing the workers. The owners will have to find out the the cause of discontent among their workers," Hasina said on Monday. She launched Knit Exposition 2009 organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association at Hotel Sheraton. The prime minister asked the owners to maintain good relations with the workers. "The government will not tolerate any anarchy in this industry. Nobody will be spared whoever is responsible for the disorder, either the owner or the workers." Hasina directed the authorities to identify the perpetrators of Saturday's violent clashes in Tongi. "No worker can damage or destroy any industry alone. Some external force is linked with that. "They should be identified and brought to justice. They are plotting to destroy the garment industry. "Those who want to destroy the industry are the enemy of the workers, economy and the country." She asked all to be careful about those people. Hasina asked the owners to reach solutions to the problems in consultation with the workers. She suggested the owners arrange dormitories for the workers. "The government has a housing fund. The owners can take money from the fund on one percent interest rate." She mentioned the steps taken by her administration for the expansion of the readymade garment industry. "The country's industry sector is facing some problems due to global economic recession. "The garment traders are searching for new markets on their own. They have found new markets in Japan, Hong Kong, South Africa and Germany. Huge export will start there," she said. "The government is also looking for new markets to sustain in the competitive market. The foreign missions are playing crucial role here. "The missions have been directed to take active steps to extend new markets. Moves are already to open new missions," Hasina said. The prime minister said the government wants to introduce a welfare economy in the country that will help meet people's fundamental rights. "It is not possible to make a sound society by keeping a major portion of society in insecurity and uncertainty. "That's why the government is working for social safety net through proper distribution of wealth and ensuring human rights and alleviating poverty." She conceded that the crises of gas and power were holding back the setting up of new industries. "During our first term there was abundance of gas in the country but this time we have to face a crisis. "To get over the crisis we are moving to explore new gas blocks. The move is also being taken to resolve power crisis. She continued: "There was huge crisis of power when we took over ten months back. "The BNP-Jamaat alliance government could not generate one megawatt of power during their five-year term. They only destroyed the sector through mismanagement, irregularities and corruption. "The export sector is the victim of their activities." Hasina said her administration had already added 700 MW of power to the national grid. "Steps have been taken to generate 4,110 MW power by 2013. We have already invited bids for generation of 530 MW of power through rented power stations. In addition, 2,810 MW power will be generated through public sector and 1,350 MW power through private sector. The prime minister said her government has taken programmes to develop road, railway and water routes to ease the transportation of goods. An elevated expressway will be built from Gazipur to Narayanganj while the rail communications between Dhaka and port town of Narayanganj is also being modernised. Hasina believed all these steps should help develop communication system which will eventually play active role in flourishing industry. Finance minister A M A Muhith, labour and expatriates' welfare minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, commerce minister Faruq Khan and the BKMEA vice-president Abdur Rashid also spoke, among others. A total of 68 companies, two of them overseas, are participating in the exhibition. Some 153 foreign delegates have already enlisted their names to take part in the exposition. bdnew
