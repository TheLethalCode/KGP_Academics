 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman Saturday called on private banks to prove IMF forecasts of falling GDP growth wrong, by increasing farm loans to boost the agro sector. A visiting IMF delegation said Thursday that Bangladesh's GDP growth would not exceed 5 percent this fiscal year though the government has set its sights on 5.5 and 6 percent growth. Finance minister AMA Muhith immediately rejected the forecast that came from the IMF delegation's assessment of the Bangladesh economy after a series meeting starting from Oct 19. Atiur Rahman said on Saturday, "Banks have been targeted to extend Tk 11,000 crore in farm loans for the current fiscal year of which TK 2,500 crore must be disbursed by private banks," "I want private banks to prove IMF forecast wrong by disbursing more than Tk 2,500 crore this year. I believe we can do that." Mentioning Bangladesh Bank and BRAC's recent launch of a Tk 500 crore refinancing scheme for sharecroppers, the first of its kind in the country, he said, "We have to prove IMF forecast wrong at any cost." Rahman was speaking at the inauguration of the Exim Krishan project at the National Shooting Federation auditorium in Gulshan. The Krishan project by the private Exim Bank plans to disburse loans to 500 farmers in the current fiscal year. It disbursed Tk 20,000 for 200 farmers from various parts of the country at theb launch of the project on Saturday. Aiming at private banks, the central bank boss said, "It will not do if we only look at towns. We have to invest in villages and fortify the economy there." "Banks branches have to be opened in villages as well as towns. More and more loans have to be disbursed for farm output and farm-based industries." "Only then, can our economy get a greta boost and prove the IMF forecast false." bd
