 Kushtia, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)Police said Tuesday that Kushtia Mahila Awami League secretary Taslima Khan Akhi and her associates, arrested Monday night with arms including an AK-47 assault rifle, have links to an outlawed extremist group. Kushtia police super Shahabuddin Khan told reporters on Tuesday that Akhi and her associate Rani Khatun had been under suspicion of ties to Gono Mukti Fouz, an extremist outfit banned by the government. "Our suspicion came true after the two women were caught with sophisticated weapons. They were clandestinely helping the banned organisation," said Khan. Akhi has also previously been implicated in the murder of a local Jubo League leader, Jamirul Islam Jamu, police say. Khan had told bdnews24.com Monday night that a police checkpost at Mangalbaria, on a tip off, had stopped a microbus heading towards Kushtia town at around 11pm. He said the microbus was found to contain an AK-47 rifle, a shotgun and 82 rounds of ammunition. Police arrested Akhi, Khatun, another passenger Abdur Razzaque, and the microbus driver 'Shahin', on the spot. After the four arrests on Monday night, police in the early hours of Tuesday made a further arrest, Akkas Ali Mollah of Dangmarka village in Daulatpur upazila. Daulatpur police chief Hasan Hafizur Rahman said Akkas Ali also had close ties with the extremist group. A case was filed against all five on Tuesday under the Arms Act. Kushtia Sadar police chief AKM Faruque Hossain said Akhi gave misleading information. "She said she was forced to carry weapons." But Akkas reportedly told police that the arms recovered from the microbus had belonged to extremist leader Biplob Hossain, of Kalishankarpur, who was killed on Sept 13 in a shootout with law enforcers. Before his death, he reportedly kept the arms hidden in the ground near his house. Akkas was quoted by police as saying "in case of any danger, the arms were to be given to Kushtia Mahila Awami League leader Taslima Khan Akhi." Kushtia town Awami League secretary, Amirul Islam, told bdnews24.com Akhi secretary of "one faction" of Kushtia town's Mahila Awami League committee. bdn
