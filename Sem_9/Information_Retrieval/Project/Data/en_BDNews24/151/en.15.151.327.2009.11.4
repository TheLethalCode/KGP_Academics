 Kushtia, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Police on Wednesday got five days to grill detained former Kushtia Mahila Awami League general secretary Taslima Khan Ankhi and three others in an arms case. The party expelled Ankhi on Tuesday after she and the three others were arrested on Monday with arms, including an AK-47 assault rifle, and alleged to have links to an outlawed extremist outfit. Police on Tuesday said all four were found to have had ties with an extremist group active in the southwest. The other arrestees are Abdur Razzaque, Rani Khatun, Akkas Ali Mollah and microbus driver 'Shahin'. Police took them to the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court on Wednesday noon and appealed to remand them for seven days. Magistrate Abdul Aziz Mandal did not order the interrogation of 'Shahin'. Officer in charge of Kushtia Sadar Police Station A K M Faruq Hossain told bdnews24.com, "The remand was asked for quizzing them further which will begin on Wednesday night." The four were arrested from a microbus on the outskirts of Kushtia town with an AK-47, a shotgun and 82 rounds of ammunition. Kushtia police superintendent Shahabuddin Khan on Tuesday told reporters that Ankhi and her associate Rani Khatun had been under suspicion of ties to Gono Mukti Fouz, an extremist left-leaning outfit banned by the government. "Our suspicions were proved after the two women were caught with sophisticated weapons. They were clandestinely supporting the banned organisation," said Khan. A police checkpost at Mangalbaria, on a tip-off, had stopped the microbus heading towards Kushtia town at around 11pm on Monday. Police arrested Ankhi, Khatun, another passenger Abdur Razzaque, and 'Shahin', on the spot after the arms were discovered in the vehicle. In the early hours of Tuesday, police made a further arrest, Akkas Ali Mollah of Dangmarka village in Daulatpur upazila. Daulatpur police chief Hasan Hafizur Rahman said Akkas Ali also had close ties with the extremist group. bdne
