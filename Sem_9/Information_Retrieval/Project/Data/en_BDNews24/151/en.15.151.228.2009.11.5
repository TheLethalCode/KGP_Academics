 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Thursday passed the amended "Bangladesh Labour (amendment) Bill, 2009" which will restrict the number of trade union bodies in Chittagong and Mongla sea ports. According to the bill, one trade union body comprising the officers and employees will exist in each of the ports. It also makes way for forming one trade union body of the workers, berth operators and other operators in the ports. Similarly, as per the bill, the "employers of workers" in the two ports can form one trade union body in Chittagong and one in Mongla. State minister for labour and employment Monnujan Sufian proposed the passage of the bill and it was passed by voice vote amid boycott of the main opposition the BNP. Fazlul Azim, an independent MP, opposed the passage of the bill without eliciting public opinion. But his proposal was rejected by voice vote. The bill was placed in parliament with a view to changing the previous "Bangladesh Labour Act-2006" passed by the BNP-led government at its fag end on Oct 10, 2006. The BNP quit power on Oct 28 that year. Ruling Awami League, which was then the main opposition, opposed the bill having 354 sections. It was passed in only 15 minutes amid walkout by the Awami League. The bill was tabled in parliament on Nov 1 this year to amend the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. The cabinet on Oct 19 approved the bill. Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, now shipping minister, was then a member of the parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment ministry. He had then placed a "note of dissent" at the time against passage of the bill.
