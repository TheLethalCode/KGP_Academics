<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 05 (bdnews24.com)Education minister Nurul Islam Thursday told parliament his ministry would distribute textbooks among students by December "at any cost". Making a statement on public importance issues, the minister said some "conspirators" set new books on fire so that the government would fail to distribute them among students. He said the preliminary findings of the government probe body showed it was "sabotage". "It was no short circuit that acused the fire at the NCTB godown." On Oct 18, the NCTB's main warehouse in Tejgaon, filled with newly printed books, caught fire. The fire burned for four days and four nights. Nahid said, "According to the preliminary findings, we see that the godown caught fire from three points closer to the ventilators. The nets of the ventilators were cut." "The investigators have found white powder in the godown". "Some people suspected that a short circuit could have caused the fire. But it is not right". The minister said the government had taken an initiative to distribute 19 crore books among primary, secondary and madrasa students. But a huge number of books had been burnt. Nahid said some people had been spreading propaganda that the government's proposed education policy was anti-Islamic, and that it would cause 300,000 teachers would lose their jobs. "The conspirators have been trying to cause sabotage on one hand and create propaganda on the other to confuse people," said the minister. "Their motive is to discredit the government," he said. "I can assure you that we will overcome all hurdles and distribute the textbooks by December". The minister also said he would inform parliament about the suspected arson after getting the final probe report in a few days.
