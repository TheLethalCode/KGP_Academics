 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)The visiting OIC chief praised Bangladesh's role on the international stage in highlighting the devastating prospect of global warming for vulnerable countries, while Dhaka sought support in the climate change battle on Tuesday. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina on his arrival in Dhaka Tuesday morning on a three-day visit. The prime minister said Bangladesh had started working with its limited resources for climate change adaptation. She sought the OIC's assistance in this regard, the prime minister's deputy press secretary Mahbubul Haque Shakil told reporters after the meeting. The OIC chief lauded the role of Bangladesh in global forums in addressing the adverse impacts of climate change for vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. Ihsanoglu said his organisation was working for the development of education, science and technology, trade and commerce and curbing terrorism. Hasina reaffirmed that Bangladesh would not harbour terrorists. "Mentioning Bangladesh's stance in the fight against terrorism, the prime minister said Bangladesh territory would not be used to launch terrorist activities," said Shakil. Ihsanoglu thanked the prime minister for the ratification of a protocol on an OIC preferential tariff scheme, said Shakil. The protocol, ratified by the government in Monday's cabinet meeting, will help strengthen trade relations among the OIC member countries. The OIC chief is visiting Bangladesh at the invitation of foreign minister Dipu Moni. He will meet with president Zillur Rahman and high-ranking government officials during his stay, says a statement of the OIC. He is also scheduled to attend a convocation of the Islamic University of Technology in Gazipur, and is expected to visit Dhaka University and deliver a talk on 'OIC's Vision Meeting the Challenges for the 21st Century'. bd
