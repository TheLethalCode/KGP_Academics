 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)The French environment minister said Thursday that Bangladesh should take a leading role in the upcoming Copenhagen climate talks, which will aim to seal a binding international agreement on carbon cuts to replace the Kyoto Protocol that expires in 2012. "The Copenhagen is approaching but there is a very real need for Bangladesh to take up a moral leadership role in these negotiations," Jean-Louis Borloo told reporters at state guest house Padma. Borloo, the number two of the French government, led a 12-member delegation on a one-day visit, for bilateral talks with the Bangladesh government in the context of the 15th UN Climate Change Conference (COP15) to be held in Copenhagen in December. "The voice of Bangladesh, in these talks, is a voice of peace and tolerance, a voice also of firmness; a voice that will considerably sway the world," said the French minister for ecology, energy, sustainable development. "And it comes from the country that grapples with all the difficulties and all the hardships that the rest of the world experiences," he said. Borloo, who is the most senior member of the French cabinet after prime minister Franois Fillon, termed the upcoming Copenhagen agreement "indispensable" and said his government was determined to move toward it. The French minister earlier met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who said an international committee should be formed under the United Nations to counter climate change. The meeting between the two focused on the Copenhagen talks, as well as bilateral issues including trade relations between the two countries, said the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad. Hasina expressed the need for more international action and combined global efforts to combat climate change, said Azad. She informed the French minister about Bangladesh's 15-point action plan to face the impacts of global warming and rising sea levels. Borloo conveyed the greetings of president Nicholas Sarkozy and an invitation for Hasina to visit France before the Copenhagen conference. Hasina also invited the French president to Bangladesh, Azad said. Foreign ministry officials say this is the first visit of a French minister in 10 years. They also said France wants Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, to play an active role in the Copenhagen talks in December. Industrialised countries, including members of the European Union and the US, and major developing economies China and India are in dissent on reduction of greenhouse gases to combat global warming and climate change.
