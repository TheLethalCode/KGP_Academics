<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has given the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner 48 hours to stop illegal filling of the Turag river skirting capital Dhaka. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddiqui gave the order on Tuesday on a petition filed by advocacy group Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Advocate Monjil Morshed filed the petition seeking court orders on the government over the illegal filling and encroachment of the river and action against the perpetrators. The High Court in October had instructed the government to submit a full report of the sites along Dhaka's rivers, the Turag and Buriganga, where filling and illegal occupation were continuing unabated despite previous court orders. Tuesday's ruling was handed down on receipt of the report.
