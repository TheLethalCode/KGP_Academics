 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)--The killers of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman not only played foul with him but they also hoodwinked the apex court, the prosecution said on Thursday. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, heard the arguments from chief state counsel Anisul Haque in the Bangabandhu murder appeals. The 24th day's hearing began at around 9:45am and ended at 1:35pm. Haque told the court Sheikh Mujib had sacrificed a lot for the establishment of Bangladesh before his death. "He had to stay behind bars for long. The period of suffering was not over even after his death. "The case was filed 21 years after his death; we had to wait 13 years for the trial. The waiting period is yet to end," he said. Haque told reporters after the hearing death convict A K M Mohiuddin (lancer) had submitted an appeal for pardoning the late submission during the leave to appeal hearing. "In his affidavit Mohiuddin said on landing at Zia International Airport he knew that he had been arrested in the Bangabandhu murder case. Going to jail he came to know that he was given death sentence. "But in the affidavit given in the US court Mohiuddin said he had killed Bangabandhu and he had been handed down death penalty in the murder case. He would be executed if he returned to Bangladesh." Haque said: "I told the court the plot was to topple the government by killing Bangabandhu. The then president was killed without any provocation or resistance or question." "Of the 61 witnesses in the case 60 gave their testimonies in the trial court. The trial court handed down death sentence to the convicts based on evidence. The High Court upheld the order. "The point of the defence was whether the complainant of the case, also Bangabandhu's assistant personal secretary, Mohitul Islam and deputy superintendent of police Nurul Islam had witnessed the event. "I presented in the court with evidence that they had been present during the event. They also took bullets. I dismissed the defence point." The defence had said they would have been hit by bullets had they been present at the scene of the incident. Referring to section 34 of the criminal procedure code, Haque said: "The section says if anybody commits anything with unique intention everybody will be responsible individually or collectively. "The declaration in the radio station and the grand scheme of killing is related. "Many of the plotters including convicts Rashid, Faruk, Shahriar, Dalim, Noor and Huda were seen at the radio station. "The significance of the radio station cannot be ignored. If they had not occupied the radio station the then vice president and prime minister (Syed Nazrul Islam and Monsur Ali) could have declared in the radio that the government was still in power. "They could call upon the public to come out on the streets. The killers would not exist then. "Their purpose was to usurp power by killing Bangabandhu. This was no incident of robbery" The court said at the hearing: "The unique intention is proved if the purpose is fulfilled." Haque said in the hearing: "More than one person had committed the killing. It was proved in the evidence and the witnesses' testimonies. The court asked him to speak about the plan of killing. Haque said: "The common intention is reflected through operation following collective planning at home. The unique intention was fulfilled after participating in the act of killing. "Radio station was a part of conspiracy. The convicts going to radio station had the link with the murder. "The point that the perpetrators will have to remain at the spot of occurrence for unique intention is not rational." The chief state counsel presented his arguments for upholding the High Court ruling. "Syed Faruk Rahman was remanded for seven days and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan for twelve days in the Bangabandhu murder case. The claim that Faruk Rahman was detained for 32 days and Shahriar for 27 days was not true. He pointed out: "Faruk Rahman was in detention for long. Later, he was taken into remand. Shahriar Rashid was remanded for 15 days in jail killing case and 12 days regarding Bangabandhu case." The prosecution started its arguments on Monday. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
