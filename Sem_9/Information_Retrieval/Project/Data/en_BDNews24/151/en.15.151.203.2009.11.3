 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka is not at risk of a major earthquake "at present", the Petrobangla chairman said on Tuesday. "Over the last two years, in collaboration with a Japanese earthquake research organisation and Bangladesh geological survey experts, I've conducted research in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet areas," said Prof Hossain Mansoor, former chairman of Dhaka University's geology department, now Petrobangla chief . "Sections of Sylhet and Chittagong zones suffer varying degrees of vulnerability as regards quakes, but Dhaka is relatively safe, since it's not threatened at present by any major earthquake risk," he said after a meeting on earthquake risk and response at the power and energy ministry. Mansoor said data and findings from research carried out around the 'Madhupur fault' area contiguous to Dhaka indicate that the fault is not active at present. "The dormant fault may be activated if major geological changes occur underground, but such changes are remote," said Mansoor. Power and energy minister Enamul Haq said, "We are working to create proper awareness of the risks and people's duties and responsibilities in an earthquake." "The media too should extend cooperation in this regard." The minister said existing technology was capable of warning people 30 seconds ahead of a quake. "Today's meeting discussed how we might use it." He was speaking in the wake of much media coverage on a recent study on quake impact, by the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme, that says around 250,000 buildings in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet cities are at risk of collapse in an earthquake. The 'seismic hazard and vulnerability assessment' survey was conducted between Feb 2008 and Aug 2009 to single out highly vulnerable buildings in the three cities using the most up to date technology, according to CDMP. The disaster management ministry last month ordered city developer RAJUK and Dhaka City Corporation to renovate the buildings vulnerable to earthquakes. Mansoor on Tuesday called upon the media not to spread panic about earthquakes, but raise people's awareness of the issue instead.
