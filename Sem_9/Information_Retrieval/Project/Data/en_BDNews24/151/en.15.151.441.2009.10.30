<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)--Future acts of killing in any regular force, such as the ones at the BDR headquarters in Peelkhana, will be held under military law, the law minister has said. Monday's regular cabinet meeting will decide on issuing a gazette notification on this matter, Shafique Ahmed told the media on Friday after a crucial meeting at his residence. Friday's meeting was convened to discuss chargesheet and related matters of the BDR mutiny and murder cases. The meeting started at 4pm with home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister for law Kamrul Islam, attorney general Mahbubey Alam, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and the deputy director general (DDG) of BDR. Ahmed also said BDR mutiny trials will start in early Nov in Khulna. However, trials for more serious charges like murder, arson, concealing bodies will be held in line with the penal code under a speedy trial tribunal. Enlarging on police investigation, the law minister said, "CID investigations are nearly finished. Charges for crimes including murder, arson, looting and concealing bodies would be pressed in court after that." Ahmed said the mutiny trial is going to be held according to their own law as there are no other relevant law. After the gazette notification, trial of all regular forces can be done according to the the Army Act 1952. The government on Sept 15 decided to try the mutineers under the BDR Act and those charged with killings and looting under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal. "A circular will be issued according to section 5 of the 1952 Army Act. Events like this would be tried according to military law from the day the circular is issued," the minister had said. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. About 3,500 border guards will stand trial for the BDR mutiny expected to start in November, the home minister said on Thursday. Law minister Ahmed said on Oct 21 that the mutiny trial would be held after the constitution of separate courts in the six divisions by the border guards' chief. However, the trial for more serious charges like murder, arson is to be held after receipt of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) report. He said the trial will be concluded in 135 days. The minister also said those accused of mutiny would be allowed to appoint lawyers, but the lawyers would not be able to participate in arguments and can only provide suggestions to the defendants. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act, 1952 even by notification bdne
