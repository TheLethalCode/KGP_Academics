 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)City developer Rajuk allotted 273 plots in Purbachal, a new satellite town of the capital, and Uttara's Phase III project by lottery on Wednesday. Fifty-five went to journalists in Purbachal New Town Project. The state minister for housing Abdul Mannan Khan said another 55 plots reserved for journalists in Purbachal would be allotted in consultation with senior figures in the profession. This is the third round draw this year for Purbachal plots. The previous two were held on Sep 16 and Oct 10. Plots have so far been allocated in eight categories in the new satellite town. Allocation of plots under four categories, including ministers and state ministers, MPs and defence and government officials, remain for the Purbachal development project. Ministers, MPs and defence and government personnel will be allotted plots outside the lottery system. In allotting plots for officials and employees of defence forces, government departments and autonomous organisations, seniority and salary structure of the applicants will be considered as a decisive criterion, said the state minister. The Uttara Model Town Phase III Project saw 218 plots go to freedom fighters, artists, writers, sportspersons, private service holders, lawyers and forex earners, among others, on Wednesday. It is the first lottery this year under the Uttara Phase III project. Plots in two previous phases were allotted under previous governments. Plots were also previously allotted for Uttara Phase III in a lottery on Oct 6, 2006. But the allocations were cancelled during the caretaker government regime. Applicants were invited again for the plots on Nov 26 last year. The computerised lottery draw was held Wednesday at Osmani Auditorium under the management of BUET experts, in the presence of Abdul Mannan Khan, state minister for housing, Rajuk chairman Eng Nurul Huda and other officials. b
