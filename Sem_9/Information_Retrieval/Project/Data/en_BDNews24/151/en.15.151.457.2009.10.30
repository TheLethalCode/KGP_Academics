Seventy-three people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka.

Law minister Ahmed said on Oct 21 that the mutiny trial would be held after the constitution of separate courts in the six divisions by the border guards' chief. However, the trial for more serious charges like murder, arson is to be held after receipt of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) report. He said the trial will be concluded in 135 days. The minister also said those accused of mutiny would be allowed to appoint lawyers, but the lawyers would not be able to participate in arguments and can only provide suggestions to the defendants. The government on Sept 15 decided to try the mutineers under the BDR Act and those charged with killings and looting under the penal code by a speedy trial tribunal. bdne
