<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party MP Mojibul Huq Chunnu Tuesday demanded an announcement from the government not to divide Kishoreganj district, now crippled by series of agitation programmes. He warned that the law and order situation may aggravate if the government rescinded its previous decision of slashing Kishoreganj and making Bhairab Bazar a new district. "The whole Kishoreganj district has been crippled by strikes. Schools, colleges and offices are closed," said Chunnu in his unscheduled speech. "Vehicular movements have come to a stop," he said. "If the law and order further deteriorates, it will be embarrassing for the government". The government earlier planned to create the new Bhairab district with five out of 13 Kishoreganj upazilas  Bajitpur, Bhairab, Katiadi, Kuliarchar and Nikli. It was a election pledge of the president, Zillur Rahman, who was elected Awami League lawmaker from this upazila and later his son Nazmul Hasan Papon won the by-polls as the seat had fallen vacant after Zillur took over as president of the republic. The JP MP said an assistant secretary of the president House served a proposal to the Cabinet for making Bhairab as a new district although the other five legislators do not know anything about this move. Speaker Abdul Hamid and Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam are the two MPs of the district. The cabinet at a meeting on Oct 12 formed a committee to examine the ways for making Bhairab a separate district with five upazilas  Bajitpur, Bhairab, Katiadi, Kuliarchar and Nikli  out of 13 upazilas of Kishoreganj. The committee was given a month's time. bdnews24.co
