<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)Elections to 78 local committees of the main opposition BNP will be held by Dec 4, the party's joint-secretary Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said on Monday. BNP has also said it will hold its national council in Dhaka on Dec 8, though the venue is still undecided. "We will not arrange a 'royal council' in a slapdash way like Awami League did. BNP is preparing for a party council in its true sense," he told reporters at BNP's Naya Paltan office. Proposed amendments to the party constitution will be properly ratified, he said. "We will bring necessary changes to the constitution to make the party modern and acceptable to all through the council." Asked when troubled BNP committees like Dhaka city's would be reformed, he said the party policymakers would decide. He said, "BNP works for the country and its people. We will do whatever needed to show path to the organisation towards the same ideology." bdnews24
