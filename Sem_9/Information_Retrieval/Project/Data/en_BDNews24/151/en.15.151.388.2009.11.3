<TITLE> New drugs packaging to halt illegal sales </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com)Medicines distributed by the government will be supplied in uniform packaging from pharmaceutical companies in a bid to ensure legal sales on the market, said health minister AFM Ruhul Haque on Tuesday. Haque said the new packaging would be clearly labelled: "Distributed by the government" and "Buying and selling of this product is a crime". The health minister, at a seminar on 'Good Manufacturing Practice' organised by Directorate of Drug Administration, said medicines meant for distribution to the poor through government hospitals were often misappropriated and resold illegally for profit. "The new packaging would mean a stop to the trend," he said. "Medicines are still available at lower prices in Bangladesh than other countries. But many big companies are not interested in producing low priced drugs." "We are thinking of forming a policy that would make it bidning on them to produce a specific amount of low priced drugs after a specific amount of turnover," he said. He also said, "We have shut some companies on charges of substandard prodiction. Companies producing contaminated, poor quality drugs all need to be shut down." "General people are being cheated by buying those drugs." Over 30 children have been killed this year after consuming an illegally-produced, contaminated paracetamol syrup, and the Directorate of Drug Administration was criticised for its slow action in withdrawing the product from the market. State minister for health Mujibur Rahman Fakir, referring to the tragedy, said, "The liability for the deaths of 33 children who consumed the drug produced by Rid Pharmaceuticals belong to the company owners." "But the DDA also has its failure. They took three months to withdraw the drugs even after the news was widespread in the media," he added. The state minister said there were only 18 drug superintendents of the DDA for the whole country. "In some cases, there are complaints against them too for inaction." "We are planning to strengthen the Directorate of Drug Administration so it can take stronger action in these cases." The government is also considering establishing a world-class drug laboratory and a drug information website, said Ruhul. The seminar, at the CIRDAP auditorium, was jointly organised by the DDA and Unicef and focused on its reports on the manufacturing quality of local pharmaceutical companies. bdn
