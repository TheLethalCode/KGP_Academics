 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Elections to Bangladesh Medical Association were held across the country on Thursday amid reports of violence and opposition boycott. The polls began at 9am and ran through to 5pm with the participation of only two groups. At least five people including a doctor and two policemen were injured in the Sylhet M A G Osmani Medical College and Hospital as the rival faction of the ruling Awami League-backed doctors and Bangladesh Chhatra League activists allegedly attacked them during the vote. Critically injured Sudarshan Sen, a medical officer, went under the knife at hospital. The other injured police sub-inspectors Rakibuzzaman and Mohammed Israfil and drivers 'Akbar' and 'Sumon' received treatment. The clash stopped vote at the centre for an hour. BMA Election Commission secretary Lutfar Rahman said 41 percent votes were cast in Dhaka. He said the counting may go on early into Friday morning. Rahman however said he had no reports of violence in Sylhet. Ruling Awami League-backed Swadhinata Chikitshak Parishad and pro-Communist Party of Bangladesh Doctors for Environment and Health are the two contesting parties in the election. Main opposition BNP-backed Doctors' Association of Bangladesh and Jamaat-e-Islami-backed National Doctors' Forum had submitted their nomination papers, but later decided to boycott the election bringing the allegation of partiality against the Election Commission. In capital Dhaka, huge contingents of police were deployed at the BMA Building on Topkhana Road where doctors were standing in long queues to cast their vote. SCP general secretary Sharfuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com DAB boycotted the election as they knew that they would be defeated in the polls. DAB president Prof AKM Azizul Haque described the election as "an unprecedented event". "The ruling party-backed organisation has set a new example of partisanship," he claimed. Dr Mahmudul Hassan is contesting for the post of president from SCP while Dr Sharfuddin Ahmed for the post of general secretary. As many as 25,133 voters, all of them doctors, will elect a 41-member Central Executive Council and 252 Central Council members. Some 102 Central Council members will be elected from Dhaka by 10,100 doctors. The central members in 37 districts have already been elected uncontested as there were no contestants there. bdnews2
