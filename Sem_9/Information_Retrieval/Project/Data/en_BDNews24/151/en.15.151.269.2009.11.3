 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The US Department of State has named Fahad bin Kamal as State Alumni Member of the Month, a US embassy press release issued on Tuesday said. Kamal is a Bangladeshi alumnus of the Department's Youth Exchange and Study (YES) programme. Throughout November, his leadership and contributions as a community organizer will be recognized on the State Alumni website (https://alumni.state.gov), the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs' official website for the more than one million Department-sponsored exchange alumni worldwide. Each month, the Bureau's Office of Alumni Affairs, which supports alumni as they build on their exchange experiences, confers the award on an outstanding alumnus or alumna. Kamal participated in the YES program in 2004, attending Milford High School in New Hampshire. During his exchange, Kamal not only lived with an American host family, but also participated in numerous school activities, including the indoor track team, the future business leaders association, and the marketing association. "That single year integrally changed my perspective on life," said Kamal. Kamal is currently in his final year at the North South University in Bangladesh, pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Human Resource Management. He continues to split time between school and community activities. For more information, students can visit the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs' website at http://exchanges.state.gov/alumni/alumnus.html., said the release
