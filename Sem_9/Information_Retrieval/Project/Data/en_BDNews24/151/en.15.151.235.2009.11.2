<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The three-day Bangladesh Knitwear Expo kicked off Monday aiming to retain buyers in the midst of the global economic downturn. "The big markets like Japan, South Africa and Hong Kong are still out of our reach," BKMEA president Md. Fazlul Hoque told bdnews24.com. "International prices and exports of knitwear have gone down because of the global recession. So, we are taking this year's fair very seriously," said Hoque. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the 'Knitexpo-09', the biggest fair of one the country's major export industries, at the Sheraton Hotel. It is the fifth annual exposition organised by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, with the theme this year of 'Discover the elegance of Bangladesh knitwear'. Over 100 buyers from Japan, Hong Kong, UK, South Africa and several European countries are taking part in the fair. Sixty-eight stalls are on show in the fair including two from abroad. Hoque expressed hope that the market for Bangladeshi knitwear will grow through this fair and foreign investment will be encouraged. Asked about possible fallout on garment exports because of recent labour unrest, he said it does dent the image of Bangladesh among foreign buyers and affect the market. A violent clash between police and garment workers in Tongi last Saturday left three dead and scores injured. "These incidents are taking place time and again but there are no proper investigations and no one is punished," he said and requested for effective steps from the government. However, the incident will not affect the fair, he added. Finance minister AMA Muhith, commerce minister Faruq Khan and labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain were present at the inauguration ceremony as the special guests. Several seminars will be held during the fair to encourage foreign buyers. bd
