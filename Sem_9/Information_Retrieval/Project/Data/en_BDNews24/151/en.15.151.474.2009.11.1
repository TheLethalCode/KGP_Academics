 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given the police three more days to grill two sons of detained former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, one of the death convicts of Bangabandhu murder case. Second additional chief metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui granted the time after the police sought 10 days to question them in connection with the case regarding the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. The court also granted three-day remand for Safiullah Safu, who was also arrested for the same reason. Akbar Hossain, assistant commissioner of police, Detective Branch filed the remand appeal. Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel and Mahbubul Hassan were arrested on Oct 27 and Safu, an alleged activist of Freedom Party on Oct 25. Safu was remanded first Oct 25 and Mohiuddin's sons on Oct 27. Six people have been arrested so far following the case filed by Taposh. Four of them four are relatives of the convicts of Bangabandhu assassination case. Police earlier arrested fugitive death convict Lt Col Abdur Rashid's daughter Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid and another convict Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan. Investigators are now quizzing all three in remand for the second phase. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings.
