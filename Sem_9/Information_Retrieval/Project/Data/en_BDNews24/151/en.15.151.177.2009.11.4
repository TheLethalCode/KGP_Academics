 WASHINGTON, Nov 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama used the 30th anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis to urge Tehran to make concessions over its nuclear program, saying it needs to turn the page on the past and forge a new relationship with the United States. "It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity and justice for its people," Obama said in a statement on Wednesday.

"This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation," Obama said. "I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past, and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect." Iran was marking the 1979 seizure of the US embassy on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Islamic state would not be tricked into reconciliation with the United States, state radio reported. "The American government is a really arrogant power and the Iranian nation will not be deceived with its apparent reconciliatory behavior until America abandons its arrogant attitude," Khamenei was quoted as saying by stat
