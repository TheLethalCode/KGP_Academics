 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)The government will resuscitate Bangladesh Better Business Forum by overhauling it, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Sunday. A task force will be constituted for scrutinising the BBBF recommendations, he told reporters after his meeting with a delegation headed by the International Finance Corporation vice president Rachel Kyte. About the RRC, Muhith said, "How can the RRC sustain without its chairman? But we'll reconstitute the BBBF. The revamping has already taken off." To review and update old laws and regulations, the caretaker government in 2007 had constituted the 17-member RRC with Akbar Ali Khan as its head. But Khan resigned from his office on Oct 15 alleging that the incumbent government was not cooperating with him. The 37-member BBBF was formed in Sep 2007 with the chief adviser to the caretaker government Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed as its head. Many of the BBBF recommendations have already been implemented. The finance minister also said the BBBF will be reorganised in a few days and a task force will be constituted to scrutinise the forum's recommendations. "The government will next implement the specific recommendations forwarded by the task force," he said. On his meeting with the IFC vice president, Muhith said, the organisation has expressed interest in investing in the small and medium enterprises, communication and power sectors. The IFC, the World Bank's lending arm, was also eager to invest in public-private partnership implementation and in setting up special economic zones, he said. bd
