 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)A forum of women and human-rights organisations has demanded lifting of reservations imposed on Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination of all forms Against Women (CEDAW) prior to submission of a national progress report. Citizens Initiatives on CEDAW said reservations imposed on the convention should be lifted before submission of the national progress report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in December. Citizens Initiatives on CEDAW, a consortium of 38 women and human-rights organisations, placed their demand at a news conference at the National Press Club on Friday. The umbrella organisation also demanded constitution of a gender equality commission (GEC) which should review all national laws, locate 'discriminatory' clauses and recommend their appropriate amendment. Ranjan Karmakar, Rawshan Jahan and Rokeya Kabir highlighted different aspects of their demands at the press conference. They demanded that before Bangladesh goes to share its national progress report on CEDAW implementation, it should lift the reservations clamped on the convention. The government has failed to lift the embargo during the last 25 years though it pledged to do so every year, they said. On forming the proposed GEC, they said, it should comprise women MPs and representatives from the Law Commission and women affairs ministry. To really stop all discriminations and ensure justice to the aggrieved women, laws should be made to provide legal aid to women and set up one-stop crisis management centres and ensure implementation of the existing laws to stop sexual harassment, they observed. Bangladesh became a signatory to the United Nations CEDAW in 1984, which said, new laws will have to be made, if necessary, to eliminate discriminations against women. Bangladesh imposed reservations on the same. Rokeya Kabir said, "According to that CEDAW clause, similar to men, women will have equal rights to making their decisions as regards marriage, children and divorce, on the implementation of which the government has imposed an embargo since ratification of the convention." The CEDAW progress report has to be submitted every five years. b
