 Khulna, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)--The Workers Party of Bangladesh on Friday stressed the implementation of 23-point common minimum programme of the 14-party in the ruling Grand Alliance. "The country's people voted to office the non-communal the Grand Alliance-led government founded on the basis of national consensus in the light of the 14-party's 23-point charter," Rashed Khan Menon, president of the party, a component in the ruling coalition, said. "The people will be disappointed if those points are not realised," he said at the opening of Khulna district council of his party at Shaheed Hadis Park. The Awami League, 11 Party, JSD and NAP are the other allies. The Awami League-led Grand Alliance was floated on these points on Nov 22, 2008. He demanded all closed mills, including Khulna Newsprint Mill, Daulatput Jute Mill and textile mills be opened without delay. In addition, he called on the government and the people to help out cyclone Aila-affected people. The chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education ministry took a swipe at the 2001-06 BNP-led government. "Militants and zealots, who were reared under the BNP-Jamaat government, have again regrouped." "They are trying to create instability in the country." He welcomed the government's vow to take strict steps against tender-terrorism, extortion and property-grabbing. Hafizur Rahman Bhuiyan, general secretary of Khulna district unit of the party of Bangladesh, presided over the council. bdne
