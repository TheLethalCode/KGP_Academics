 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com)The government Sunday tabled a bill in parliament to amend the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. The bill proposes two trade union bodies for labourers and employees of the country's two portsChittagong and Mongla. The bill will also give opportunity to form a combined trade union body for users, berth operators and all labourers and employees of the two ports. The bill has proposed reducing the punishment for anyone who "willingly creates obstruction for the officials in charge of implementing labour laws". It suggests a maximum three months imprisonment for those creating bar to implementation of the law. Bangladesh Labour Act had a maximum six-year jail term for a similar offence. Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain tabled the Bangladesh Labour Act (amendment) Bill 2009 which was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry for further scrutiny. The bill is likely to be passed during the current session of parliament, officials have said. The draft of the new bill got the cabinet nod on Oct 19. The previous BNP-led government, which left office on October 28, 2006, passed the weighty Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 on October 10 that year amid walkout by the then main opposition, now ruling party, Awami League. The bill having 354 sections was passed in just 15 minutes. Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, now shipping minister, was then a member of the parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment. He then placed a "note of dissent" at the time against passage of the bill. bdnews
