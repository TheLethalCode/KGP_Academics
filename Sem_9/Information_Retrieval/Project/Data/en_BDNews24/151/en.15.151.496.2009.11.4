 Kushtia, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Another woman was arrested on Wednesday at Kushtia town's Mazampur on suspicion of her involvement with a banned extremist group, police said. Assistant police superintendent of Kushtia Alamgir Hossain told bdnews24.com Chumki Rahman, 30, is a member of Gono Mukti Fouz, an extremist left-leaning outfit banned by the government. Earlier on Monday police arrested former Kushtia Mahila Awami League general secretary Taslima Khan Ankhi, her associate Rani Khatun and Akkas Ali Mollah on suspicion of similar ties, Kushtia police super Shahabuddin Khan told reporters. A Detective Branch team, on a tip off, arrested Rahman from Mazampur at around 1pm. Police said, based on evidence, she used to live on a rented house in Aruapara area of the town and had connections with terrorists.

Officer in charge of Bhramara Police Station Sarwar Hossain said Chumki will be quizzed on Wednesday night. She is the main accused in an explosives case. b
