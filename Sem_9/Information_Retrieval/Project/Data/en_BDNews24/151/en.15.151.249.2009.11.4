 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)A visiting delegation of British parliamentarians on Tuesday said the UK would continue its support to Bangladesh, but warned that British taxpayers wanted to be sure their money was not misspent. The British parliament's International Development Committee, comprising nine members from three political parties, met the prime minister, cabinet members, development partners, representatives of the civil society during a five-day tour. It also visited different programmes run by DFID, the UK government's development arm. The parliamentary committee oversees the policy, administration and expenditure of DFID. The delegation said UK aid would continue to support Bangladesh in the next five years in the fields of poverty eradication and climate change adaptation. "Bangladesh has a bright future as in the last few days we saw the people working hard to overcome poverty and progressing with their efforts despite different natural adversities," Malcolm Bruce, chairman of the committee, told a press conference in the capital. He said the British government would continue its assistance for Bangladesh through the activities of DFID. He sopke of different activities on poverty elimination, health security and development. "We want to assure that the British aid will be available for Bangladesh as our government wants to play a role in poverty eradication in countries like Bangladesh." The UK government has plans to give  126 million in bilateral aid in 2009-10, he said. But, in reply to a question, Bruce said, "It's our taxpayers' money. They want to know where the money goes." "We won't tolerate any fraud," said the parliamentarian, in reply to a question on the monitoring of illegal use of aid. He said if any irregularities occurred, "We'll stop funding for projects." Regarding climate change and Bangladesh's adaptation efforts, IDC members said they had agreed to assist the developing countries after a recent discussion in Brussels and hoped for a good outcome from the Copenhagen Conference in December. Other members of the committee are John Battle, Hugh Bayley, Nigel Evans, Mark Hendrick, Mark Lancaster, Virendra Sharma, Marsha Singh and Andrew Stunell. bdn
