<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has urged the government to give a portion of the financial stimulus package to the apparel sector dogged by global economic downturn. Khaleda made the call in her addressing to the closing ceremony of the BATEXPO-2009 at Sonargaon Hotel on Friday. The fair ends on Saturday, though. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated on Thursday the annual three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition, organised by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters' Association. She demanded measures to improve security to facilitate the readymade garment business's growth and competitiveness in the global market. In April, the government announced a proposed stimulus package of Tk 3,424 crore. However, the two major trade bodies of the garments industry, the BGMEA and BKMEA, were highly critical as the highest export-earning RMG sector was excluded altogether from the proposed package. The two trade bodies later welcomed the revised Tk 5,000 crore package included in the FY 2009-10 budget, although they again expressed concern that the RMG sector still received no specific allocation. On Sept 3, BGMEA president Salam Murshedi said the sector required its own financial package of Tk 3,000 crore by Sep 7 to salvage the industry and help clear worker wages and allowances ahead of Eid. The ultimatum was widely criticised by government, workers, unions and even other business organisations. Finance minister A M A Muhith had rejected the demand, saying it was not right for the industry leaders to link the issue of financial support with worker dues ahead of Eid. The BGMEA later issued an apology for their request, saying "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted their appeal. "The package was designed, ignoring the garments sector, to assist the agriculture, power and export sectors. But the reality is the aid is yet to reach,"the former prime minister said. "I'm placing my demand to the government so that the sector gets a piece of the package," main opposition BNP chairperson said. "We've to keep the prices of our products competitive to survive in the open global market. The need now is to reduce internal cost and ensure a sound environment for production and investment. She also demanded formation of industrial police and intelligence force for the garments sector, which the government says are under consideration. The former prime minister was also concerned about the recent unrest in the sector and said conspirators are trying to create chaos to destabilise the sector. "It's the government's duty to ensure proper law and order in the sector. But we do not see any reflection of their tough-sounding attitude," she said. She did not rule out involvement of 'foreign hand' and inciting of the neighbouring countries in the recent violence. "The country's trade and commerce are at stake due to deterioration of law and order, extortion and tender-terrorism by the people backed by the incumbent government. "The local and foreign investment has stalled," Khaleda claimed.. "Specially, the fighting among the ruling party cadres about rags trading has pushed the situation to a new low. Addressing the garment owners, Khaleda said they need to keep an eye to prevent labour unrest. "I think friendly relations can be established if the owners exchange views on all issues with the workers once a month, if possible," she said. The sector has recently been rocked by violent riots and demonstrations by the workers who demand back pay and minimum wage. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi highlighted the difficulties facing the sector. Addressing Khaleda, he said: "I sincerely request you, being the opposition leader in the parliament, to discuss our proposals in the House." BNP's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee member M Shamsul Islam, former commerce advisor Barkat Ullah Bulu MP also spoke. According to BGMEA, 62 companies are participating this year's BATEXPO fair, many from UK, USA, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. There are some 86 stalls at the fair on the sideline of which a cultural night and fashion show would be held as part of the BATEXPO tradition. The three-day knitwear exposition, KNITEXPO 2009, organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, ended on Wednesday. There are around 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh, employing 3.5 million workers with 85 percent women. The garment industry is the biggest foreign exchange earner in Bangladesh. The sector exported products worth 12.35 billion U.S. dollars in last 2008-09 fiscal year (July 2007-June 2008), nearly 80 percent of the country's total export volume. bd
