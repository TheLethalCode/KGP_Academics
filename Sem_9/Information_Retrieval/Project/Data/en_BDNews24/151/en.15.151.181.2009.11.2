 Kishoreganj, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com) All shops and businesses in Kishoreganj were shut down on Monday as people enforced a day-long hartal in the district protesting against the government's move to create the proposed new district of Bhairab. A citizen's group is observing the strike demanding the integrity of the old Kishoreganj district. All educational institutions, offices and banks also kept their doors shut in observance of the hartal. The hartal disrupted road and rail communications along Dhaka, Mymensingh and Kishoreganj routes. President Zillur Rahman, speaker Abdul Hamid and ruling Awami League general secretary and LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam were all elected to parliament from constituencies in Kishoreganj district. Bhairab-bound Issa Khan Express was stuck at Nilganj railway station in Kishoreganj and Chittagong Mail halted at Sararchar station under Bajitpur Upazila due to the strike. President Rahman was elected from Bhairab in the national elections. After he vacated the constituency, his son Nazmul Hassan was elected MP in a by-election. Different protest processions were taken out from various spots of the district town supporting the hartal. The strike is also being observed in Bhairab and 12 other Upazilas of the district. The demonstrators set fire to an effigy of the president in the town's Gatail area at around 10:45am, witnesses said. A series of agitation programmes were being observed at different Upazilas of the district for the last 15 days against the government's decision to form Bhairab district encompassing five Upazilas  Nikli, Bajitpur, Kuliarchar, Katiadi and Bhairab. bdn
