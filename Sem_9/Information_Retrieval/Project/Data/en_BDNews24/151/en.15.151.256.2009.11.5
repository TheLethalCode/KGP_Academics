<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Liberal Democratic Party chairman Oli Ahmad has asked the government to restrict the activities of the military spy outfit DGFI to the armed forces only. "Limit the activities of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence to cantonments only," said Ahmad, a retired colonel, in his winding up speech in parliament on Thursday. "Then incidents such as the BDR mutiny (Feb 25-26) would not take place in future." "You have to take pre-emptive measures. Strengthen the intelligence agencies, if necessary. Ahmad, one of the two opposition MPs, said :The intelligence agencies must be made more active. They must collect information before an incident takes place." He highlighted some of the unpleasant incidents since the government took office on Jan 6 this year. The DGFI is alleged to have hands in many political developments in the country's history since its independence in 1971. Ruling Awami League's many MPs including its former general secretary Abdul Jalil had alleged in parliament that the DGFI arrested them unlawfully and tortured for days in some undisclosed locations when the military-backed interim government was in power. He also suggested that the MPs are allowed to import vehicles tax-free on some conditions. A former BNP MP, Oli said many MPs had no financial capability to buy cars. The government will need to spend hugely if it provided the MPs with cars, he added. "I think the government should allow tax-free import of cars to the MPs having financial capabilities. "The government can provide cars to the insolvent MPs only," said Ahmed. He said the tax-free cars import should be made in a manner so that the MPs could not sell their vehicles to others or mortgage the same. "The process must be transparent," he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was chairing the session, said the parliament secretariat was considering some measures to provide the MPs transport facilities in a transparent manner.
