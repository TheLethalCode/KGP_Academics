<TEXT>
 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)British charity The Meningitis Trust has urged prospective Hajj pilgrims to ensure they are immunised against the infectious disease as part of their preparations for travel to Makkah. The Trust helps and supports people struggling to cope with the very serious impact of meningitis, which causes inflammation of the lining around the brain and spinal cord. It is reminding pilgrims from all over the UK to have the ACWY vaccine at least three weeks before they travel, as it is a legal requirement for entry into Saudi Arabia. The quadrivalent vaccine protects against four different groups of meningitis  A, C W135 and Y. Muslims in the UK can request a 'Meningitis Hajj and Umrah' information booklet from the Meningitis Trust, which provides them with information on the disease, prior to their pilgrimage. The Trust tells pilgrims that the vaccine will protect them from strains of meningitis that are not common in the British isles, but may be carried to Makkah by pilgrims from other parts of the world. Alison Osborne, UK BME Co-ordinator at the Meningitis Trust, says: "Meningitis and associated meningococcal septicaemia (blood poisoning) can affect anyone at any time and can kill within hours." "Survivors can be left with disabling after-effects, including brain damage, deafness and, where septicaemia has occurred, loss of limbs." "People need to be fully aware of the dangers of meningitis, both in the UK and abroad and receive appropriate protection where available. When people are in prolonged close contact in large gatherings, such as Hajj, opportunities for the transfer of bacteria between people increase. " Alison continues, "Pilgrims should be aware that there is still no vaccine to protect against all types of meningitis. Awareness of the common signs and symptoms will protect both the pilgrims and their families". More than 500,000 people living in the UK have had meningitis and thousands more have been affected by the disease within their family. The Meningitis Trust helps around 20,000 people each year through its unique range of professional services and community support; giving vital support to those who have been affected by this life-changing disease.
