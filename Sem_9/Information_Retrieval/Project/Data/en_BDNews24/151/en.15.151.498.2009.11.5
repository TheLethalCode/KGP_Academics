<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government has formed a committee to coordinate the spy agencies to improve the law and order. "We are reactivating the intelligence agencies. Previously, different intelligence agencies used to perform their duties in different ways," she said in her winding up speech in parliament on Thursday "I have been receiving information from them (spy agencies) after every 15 days. 'I will tell nothing more now," Hasina said. Oppositiom MP Oli Ahmed had earlier asked for confining the activities of military's spy outfit DGFI inside the cantonment only. Accusing opposition parties of not supporting democracy, prime minister said "It needs monitoring whether they are plotting conspiracy to hamper democratic process as they are issuing ultimatum to topple 10-month-old government." She questioned whether the main opposition BNP was trying to disrupt the ongoing democratic practice in the country. Hasina categorically said her administration will not spare any terrorists even if they belonged to her Awami League party. She said her government needed time to clear off "the rubbish" heaped by the BNP-led government and the caretaker government. "The opposition is not attending parliament at a time when we are investigating the Aug 21 grenade attack, when we have chalked out the initiative to try the war criminals, when the investigation of the BDR mutiny is ongoing," Hasina said in her speech. "What do they want to do? What signal are they giving (to the nation)? Whom are they supporting? "Do they want to disrupt the democratic process," the prime minister said volleying a series of questions. Hasina said the opposition should support the government at this moment. The main opposition BNP and its allies have been staying away from parliament since June this year. She said her government had been "cordially" trying to improve the law and order in the country. The prime minister attributed the alleged deteriorating law and order to the BNP government which "armed the militants" during its five years of rule. "We cannot clean the rubbish piled up in the last seven years so quickly," said Hasina who came under a grenade attack on Aug 21, 2004 when the BNP was in power. She sought support from the common people to eliminate the terrorists. "Terrorists have no political identity. We will not spare them, I will never spare terrorists even if they belong to my party," said Hasina in the wake of series of alleged violent incidents created by her party and front organisations since Awami League came to power on Dec 29, 2008. Hasina said her government would not intervene into the anticorruption drive of the Anticorruption Commission. "The Anticorruption Commission will take action against those involved in corruption," she said. "The drive against corruption will go on, but not like the previous caretaker government which appeared before media to show the antigraft initiatives," said Hasina, who was detained in prison for 11 months by the interim administration on a slew of corruption charges.
