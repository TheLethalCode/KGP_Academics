 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has said the government did not receive any news of deaths in Saturday's violent clashes between police and garment workers at Tongi, during which at least 3 people were reported killed and scores injured. Police were forced to fire teargas and rubber bullets as a demonstration by angry workerswho said they found Nippon Garments factory at Ershad Nagar closed without notice in the morningspilled out onto the streets. Traffic on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway was blocked for over four hours from 9am. Despite multiple witness accounts, police did not confirm any dead and garment industry leaders rejected the reports of deaths. Industry association BGMEA, who formed a probe body to investigate what happened, claimed there were "high chances of external influence behind the incident." The home minister spoke to reporters in the evening as she visited some of the injured at Rajarbag Police Line Hospital and Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Emerging from DMCH, she said, "We did not get any news about any deaths yet. If we do, then we will let everyone know. If anyone is found dead, I will be deeply grieved and the home ministry will investigate the incident." "What happened in Tongi is very saddening. I have talked with BGMEA leaders. They have formed a probe. I have learned from them that no wages were unpaid. So it has to be investigated that what were reasons behind the owners of the factory calling a 'lay-off'." According to witnesses, at least 100 people were injured during the violence, including police. Witnesses, media say 'up to 4 dead', police yet to confirm There were widespread reports on the groundfrom witnesses that included journalists, locals, bystanders as well as workersthat at least three people were killed. Media had initially reported between two and four dead, some reported that one of the dead included a policewomen. Witnesses told bdnews24.com's Gazipur correspondent that at least one person was identified as he lay in front of the factory gates "after being hit by bullets" - it was not clear what type of bullets might have caused his death. They said he was Babul Sheikh, 28, son of Anu Sheikh of Dinajpur and a van-puller whose wife Roksana was a worker at Nippon Garments. Locals said they lived at Block No 5 of Ershad Nagar and had two children. They said Babul was shot while searching for his wife during the clash. Witnesses said the body of another male, around 55 years old, was seen from in front of the factory gate, but his identity was unknown. Other witnesses reported yet a third unidentified body. Many witnesses also said police had recovered the bodies and driven them away. But police had still not confirmed any deaths up to late night. Inspector General of Police Nur Mohammad, at the scene just after midday, said the factory was "laid off" the previous night, but police were not informed. He said police were unable to deploy patrols ahead of time to prevent the untoward situation. He did not confirm any deaths. Locals said workers of Nippon Garments in Ershad Nagar were demonstrating at the factory from 8am over unpaid dues. They said police tried to stop them as they were taking their protest to the street, which prompted the violence. The angry workers damaged and set fire to a number of vehicles, while police were forced to use tear gas shells and rubber bullets to bring the situation under control. The violence abated a little after 11:30am as additional police and RAB were deployed on the spot, but sporadic clashes continued until 1pm, said witnesses. At least fourteen of the injured were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, many with injuries from rubber bullets. Among them were workers as well as bystanders, said hospital officials. At least one injured police woman was admitted to RPLH. Local MP Zahid Ahsan Russel and Tongi municipality mayor Azmatullah went to the spot and spoke to workers at around 1pm. The workers said they found the factory closed that morning without any previous notice, which sparked their demonstration. Majeda Begum, a worker of the factory, told bdnews24.com, coming to work they had found that the gate was locked. "We were owed many arrears. As the workers wanted break the lock to enter the factory, police obstructed us." Another worker, Parveen, said the owners had been saying that they would close the factory. "But they have to pay our arrears before they close." BGMEA say no deaths, forms probe Pressed by reporters as she left DMCH, about the alleged deaths, home minister Sahara Kahtun said, "I am still not aware of any deaths. Some people were injured including police. I have visited injured police officers at the Rajarbag hospital. And I have seen other of the injured here." Answering another question on police fire during the incident, she said, "If police fired randomly, then steps will be taken to investigate that." President of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Salam Murshedi, also said no one had died. He claimed too that no arrears were due to workers and that the entire incident was stage-managed. In an urgent press conference at BGMEA Bhaban on Saturday evening, Murshedi rejected the reports of deaths in the clashes, saying, "According to BGMEA's own investigation and information received from police authorities, no one had died in the Nippon Garments clash up to 5pm." He cited IGP Nur Mohammad, saying, "Neither the government nor police have confirmed the rumours of deaths." Instead, Murshedi said, "Evidence had been found indicating high chances of external influence behind the incident." The BGMEA chief claimed, "People were brought from outside in an attempt to create chaos. Proper investigation will bring out the true story behind it." He said a five-member investigation committee has been formed by the BGMEA with a report to be submitted in 72 hours. The probe team will be led by BGMEA vice president Faruk Hasan, with BGMEA directors Mr. Reaz-Bin-Mahmood, Mohammed Nasir and Shahidullah Azim along with former director SM Mannan Kochi as members. bd
