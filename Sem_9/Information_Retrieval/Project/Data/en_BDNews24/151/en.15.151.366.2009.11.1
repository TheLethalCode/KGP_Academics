<TITLE> Education policy supports madrasa teaching: Nahid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  There will be nothing that runs counter to Islam or undermines madrasa teaching in the proposed education policy, the education minister said Saturday. "Rather, there will be improved education in all spheres," minister Nurul Islam Nahid said, exchanging views with leaders of Bangladesh Jamiatul Modarresin, an organisation of madrasa teachers, at a mosque in the capital. "The proposed education policy supports moral teachings from religion, while modern and scientific teaching is also incorporated, keeping madrasa intact as educational entities," Nahid said. "There will be no interference in madrasa education. Rather, efforts are being made to ensure improved education through the policy while keeping madrasa tradition, and their significance intact." Work to implement the education policy will start soon after eliciting opinions on the draft recommendations, he said. The government formed a committee on Apr 8 to formulate a new national education policy with national professor Kabir Chowdhury as its chief. The committee submitted its draft recommendations to the education minister in August, Nurul Islam Nahid. The recommendations were also placed on the education ministry's website to elicit opinions from all sections of people. There draft policy includes separate chapters on primary, secondary and higher education, technical and madrasa education. Pointing out that the policy will be revised in case of any shortcomings, Nahid said, "The education policy will be flexible. Initiatives should not be foiled just for a few misgivings." Though nine education commissions have been formed since independence in 1971, none of their policies or recommendations have been completely implemented, said educationist Qazi Kholiquzzaman, member of the Chowdhury committee. Bangladesh Jamiatul Modarresin president AMM Bahauddin said, "It will be grim if anything against Islam or madrasa education is included in the education policy." Sharshina Pir, Maulana Shah Muhammad Muhibullah, Baitul Mokarram Khatib, Mohammad Salahuddin, among others, were present during the meeting. bd
