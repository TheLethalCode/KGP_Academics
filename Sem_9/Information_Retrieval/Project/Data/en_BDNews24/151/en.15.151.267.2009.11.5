 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)At least four people were injured in a blast on Thursday in front of a market in the capital's crowded Gulistan area, about 200 metres from Awami League's headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. Police could not immediately confirm the source of the explosion, but said it may have been a Molotov cocktail detonation. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Islam told bdnews24.com, "We don't believe it was a bomb." The blast occurred at around 2pm in front of Muktijoddha Market, Ramna zone deputy police commissioner Atiqul Islam told bdnews24.com. "We cannot say right now about the cause of the explosion," Islam told bdnews24.com at around 4pm. "We are investigating." Three of the injured were immediately identified as Nasir Uddin, 45, a former Union Parishad chairman of Kochua in Bagerhat; Sheikh Nazrul Islam, 50, president of Bagerhat Bus Owners Association; and Kartik Lal Das, 48, a passerby. They were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Islam said. Nasir Uddin's condition was critical, he added. Witnesses at the hospital, however, said there was at least one other injured person waiting for treatment in a bloodied shirt at the scene. The fourth injured man was eventually identified as Abdur Rashid, 58, admitted to DMCH after the first three. Sheikh Nazrul Islam, meanwhile, was released after primary treatment, Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Islam told bdnews24.com. He also said there was "no evidence" of any bomb. Advocate Mir Shawkat Ali Badsah, a Bagerhat MP, had earlier told bdnews24.com he had gone to the spot seeing a crowd gathering in front of the market on his way to Ramna Bhaban from the Secretariat. I saw three people, including two from my constituency, lying there bleeding. "I took them to the hospital immediately," he said. Nazrul Islam and Nasir Uddin were local Awami League leaders in their area, the MP said. bdnew
