 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Nominations are being finalised to appoint an ombudsman in line with the constitution, the law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Saturday. "Since the government wants to establish rule of law it has moved to appoint an ombudsman in line with the constitution," Shafique said launching a human rights training programme for legal practitioners on Saturday. "A scrutiny committee, headed by the speaker, has been asked to finalise the nominations. He will do so in consultation with ruling and opposition MPs." "The government will make the appointment after getting the committee's proposal," Shafique said, launching the training under a law ministry project 'Promoting access to justice and human rights in Bangladesh'. On the activities of the ombudsman, the minister said: "If any person is harassed or harmed by any government actions they can place complaints to the ombudsman." "The ombudsman will recommend necessary steps after investigation of complaints," he said. The government has already passed National Human Rights Commission Act, and started work to form a commission with chairman and other members, said the law minister. "The appointment process for the commission will be complete soon," Shafique said. He called on lawyers and state counsels to work for establishing human rights. State minister for law Quamrul Islam said: "The lawyers play the main role in establishing rule of law." "They will have to work to raise awareness of rights among justice seekers and citizens to this end," he said. Regarding recent controversy over 'crossfire' or extra-judicial killings, the law minister said: "The government does not support or condone extra judicial killings in any way. If any such killings occur steps will be taken after investigation." Shafique also said the government was determined to conclude the trial of the Aug 15 1975 assasiantion of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family and to start trial of the Nov 3 1975 'Jail Killings' of four national leaders. "We failed to bring the criminals who committed such heinous acts to justice. This is very unfortunate." Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal presided over the inauguration of the training programme. b
