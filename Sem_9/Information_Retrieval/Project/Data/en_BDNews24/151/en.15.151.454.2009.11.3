<TEXT>
 By Mintu Chowdhury in Chittagong Chittagong, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  An unscrupulous influential quarter continues cutting the hills in and around the port city of Chittagong, in gross breach of environmental laws, say locals and officials. They have allegedly been engaged in cutting the hills in collusion with some corrupt public officials in the different parts of the city including Khulsi, Bayezid and Lalkhan areas, local people and environmental activists alleged. The government's Department of Environment also concedes that certain groups were developing housing estates and multi-storied buildings by cutting the hills in the burgeoning port city. Witnesses alleged hill cutting is rampant, specially in the dark of night, in utter disregard to exiting laws while the DoE or the local administration is taking no action to stop it. Such rampant cutting of the hills is not only destroying the natural beauty and ecology of the picturesque port city, but also rendering the inhabitants living at the foot of the hills to the danger of fatal landslides, environmentalists pointed out. When asked, the officials of the local police administration claimed hill cutting has stopped and they were unaware if it still continued. DoE has filed eight cases in connection with hill cutting over the last two months, officials said. But the number of cases are too few compared to the magnitude of the offence, they admitted. The number of people arrested on charge of illegal cutting of hills is also not worth mentioning. bdnews24.com's correspondent while visiting different parts of the city discovered that parts of some natural hills and hillocks had been sliced out in South Khulsi residential area, Khulsi Road, Khulsi VIP housing area, Ispahani Park Road and Bayezid areas by greedy developers with the help and supervision of hired musclemen. Some local people and officials alleged that most of the government owned hills are now under the possession of illegal occupants. DoE director in charge of Chittagong region, Abdus Sobhan, admitted the allegation of cutting hills but he claimed that the incidence nowadays is lower than it was before. Sobhan told bdnews24.com, "Department of Environment has lodged eight cases in connection with hill cutting over the last two months." "The cases have been filed against the offenders complying with the directives of state minister for forest and environment minister Hasan Mahmud," he said Asked about action against those who were cutting the hills in breach of law, Sobhan said, "We have lodged charges against them and police will trace out the offenders after investigation." DoE alone can do nothing but only lodge cases against the offenders, he said Khulsi police chief Iftekhar Hasan claimed that no hills were being cut after filing of the cases. Iftekhar told bdnews24.com that no evidence was found about the allegation that hills belonging to one Anwar Chowdhury and others were being cut. He said police regularly patrol the hill areas every day since filing of the cases while the locals people claimed that they saw the hills being cut even on weekend nights. Sharif Chowhan, coordinator of Chittagong environmentalist organisation Janauddog, told bdnews24.com that all were aware of the fact of rampant hill cutting in the city under the very nose of the administration, while police and local administration give a blind eye to the offence. He demanded stringent punishment of the perpetrators after bringing them to book and pointed out that hill cutting could be stopped once and for all if DoE and the local administration was up and doing. bdnews2
