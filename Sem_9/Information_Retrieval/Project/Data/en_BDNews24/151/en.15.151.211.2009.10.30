 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given the police four more days to question Mehnaz Rashid Khandaker, daughter of Aug 15 convict retired Lt Col Abdur Rashid, in Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh bomb attack case. Assistant commissioner of police Akbar Hossain from the Detective Branch sought 10 day's remand on Friday, but metropolitan magistrate A K M Emdadul Haq gave four days. Mehnaz's lawyers Abu Salim Chowdhury, Helal Uddin Ahmed and Kazi Shafiqur Rahman appealed the court for rejection of the remand appeal and granting bail. They said in the hearing there was no point in remanding a mother with a breast-fed child. The investigators could not glean any crucial information from her during the previous round of questioning in remand. The move to remand her in custody was aimed only to harass Mehnaz. If it was absolutely necessary, she could be questioned at the jail gate, they told the court. The prosecution protested the mention of Mehnaz's infant and said in 1975, Taposh and Sheikh Russel (prime minister Sheikh Hasina's youngest brother, were also children. Taposh had hidden under the bed during the assassination of founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with most members of his family at his house. The killers did not spare children. Mehnaz is the daughter of one of the killers and has connections with the bomb attack on Taposh, they contended. Defence lawyers, however, argued that Mehnaz's child was born a few months back through a Caesarean section. She is not in the physical state to go through the rigours of remand. Her child is not getting the mother's milk, they pointed out. The court instructed the investigating officer to keep watch over the child. The remand petition said evidence and testimonies established that Mehnaz had links with the suspects and the detained connected to Taposh murder attempt. Moreover, vital information on the 1975 killings of Bangabandhu and his family members were also elicited from her. Police need 10 more days to arrest other suspects, verify and authenticate data and evidences and lift the veil of the bombing mystery, they said. Mehnaz has been detained in the custody of Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court. Detective police on Saturday held Mehnaz, two days after brother of another fugitive death convict was arrested. Detective Branch of police assistant commissioner Akbar Hossain told bdnews24.com that they had detained Mehnaz from her Gulshan house. Hossain is investigating the bomb attack case. On the same day Mehnaz was produced in the court and the police petitioned the court to remand her for interrogation. The court granted her to be remanded for five days. Kamrul Haque Swapan, the brother of self-confessed killer Shariful Haque Dalim, and another fugitive convict, was arrested on Thursday following Wednesday's bomb attack on Taposh. Mehnaz's husband Rafique Khandaker is a businessman. Her father retd lt col Abdur Rashid is now absconding. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were also murdered on Aug 15, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21 night. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. Taposh alleged the next day that the attack was made upon him to derail the appeals process in the Supreme Court. He filed a case with Motijheel Police Station earlier in the day, mentioning no names, but alleging that the relatives and associates of those convicted of the Aug 15 killings were involved in the attack. The case details said they carried out the attack in a premeditated manner to kill him in order to disrupt the final outcome of the trial of the killers of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib. bdne
