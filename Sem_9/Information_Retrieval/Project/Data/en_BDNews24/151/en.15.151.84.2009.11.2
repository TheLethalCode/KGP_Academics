<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)--The government on Monday gave final approval to Vested Property Return (Amendment) Act 2009 in a bid to redress past seizures of so-called enemy property. The law, provisionally approved on Sept 9, will now be placed in parliament for the passage to replace the caretaker government's Vested Property Return Ordinance. The final approval came from a regular cabinet meeting presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her deputy press secretary Mahbubul Haque Shakil told reporters after the meeting. The cabinet also provisionally approved Acid Control (Amendment) Act 2009, National Institute of Biotechnology Act 2009, Bangladesh Environment Conservation (Amendment) Act 2009 and Environment Court Act 2009, he said. The proposed law is meant to redress the long-disputed Vested Property Act, originally introduced by the Pakistan government in the 1960s, and which still gives the state power to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of his/her property. The VPA has long been criticised in Bangladesh and abroad as a major violation of the rights of citizens, especially minorities, who have had property seized in the past simply on leaving the country. It derives from the Enemy Property (Custody and Registration) Order II of 1965, promulgated in Pakistan following a brief war between India and Pakistan in 1965. This order was directed against those perceived as an enemy, and was used as an instrument for appropriating land belonging to Hindus accused of supporting India. After Bangladesh won independence from Pakistan, Order No-29 of 1972 changed the nomenclature to Vested Property Act without altering the content of the law. The previous Awami League government, just before its exit from power in 2001, tabled a new law, the Vested Property Return Act, fixing a 180-day time limit to prepare a list of properly documented vested property in order to take steps to restore falsely seized lands. The subsequent BNP government by the end of 2001 amended the bill replacing the 180-day deadline with an 'indefinite period'. The list was never completed. A parliamentary watchdog on March 11 this year asked the land ministry to draft the new Vested Property Return Act restoring the six-month deadline for local authorities to compile a list of land seized under the law. Last June, land minister Rezaul Karim said deputy commissioners throughout the country were already in the process of finalising lists of properties seized under the vested property law. b
