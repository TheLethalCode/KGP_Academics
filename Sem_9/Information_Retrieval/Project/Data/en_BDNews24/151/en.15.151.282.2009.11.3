 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)--Parliament on Tuesday condemned the killing of four national leaders who were killed inside Dhaka Central Jail on Nov 3, 1975. Senior Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta proposed adoption of a motion censuring the gruesome killing. "We strongly condemn the killing. We also pray for the salvation of the departed soul of the four national leaders," deputy speaker Shawkat Ali told the House in his ruling. Sengupta was the only MP to speak on the killings of Tajuddin Ahmed, Syed Nazrul Islam, Capt M Mosur Ali and A H M Kamruzzaman, the wartime government leaders. Sengupta in his unscheduled speech said the jail killings were a state-sponsored terrorism. "Any imprisoned persons were supposed to be under the protection of the state. But the killers at the behest of then president Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed entered the jail and left the scene by killing the leaders," said Sengupta. He said the country would not be free from terrorism and millitancy unless the government ensured a fair trial of the state-sponsored killings. "The BNP government manipulated the verdict of the killings and released the accused persons," he said. Suranjit urged the government to guarantee a fair trial to make the nation free from stigma. The Awami League in its previous term initiated the trial of the jail killings. The trial court handed down majority of the accused people death sentence. But most of the convicts were ruled to be "not guilty" during the tenure of the succeeding government led by the BNP. Prime minister Sheikha Hasina on Tuesday announced that her government would seek a re-trial of the killings.
