 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)Apparel owners' association BGMEA has urged the opposition chief to return to parliament and discuss their problems. "I sincerely request you, as the opposition leader in parliament, to discuss our proposals in the House," BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi said to Khaleda Zia at the closing ceremony of the BATEXPO-2009 at Sonargaon Hotel on Friday. Khaleda attended the programme as the chief guest. In his speech Murshedi highlighted the difficulties facing the sector and suggested some proposals for government assistance. Terming the ruling party the front wheel and the opposition the rear wheel of a bicycle, he said "Both the wheels are needed to ride a cycle. "We earnestly expect that parliament will be the centre of governing the country." The opposition, led by the BNP, joined the parliament's first session on Jan 6 after the Awami League-led grand alliance government took office. But they boycotted the two following sessions. Mentioning the role of Khaleda, he said, "You did a lot for the industry not only when you were in power, but also from the opposition. You withdrew general strike in the greater national interest and to save the RMG sector. "The industry began its journey in the late 1970s with 12,000 dollars worth of order during president Ziaur Rahman's tenure, which now has become an industry of $ 12.35 billion." Murshedi said, "It would be impossible to reach the current position if the approval of back-to-back L/C and bonded warehouse facilities were not provided when Zia was in power." The annual three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition, organised by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters' Association was inaugurated by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday. The fair ends on Saturday. bd
