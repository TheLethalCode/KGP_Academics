 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)Experts anticipate the capital market livening up once Grameenphone shares hit the trading floors of the twin bourses, though some warn it could overheat the market. The long-awaited floating, the biggest ever in Bangladesh, is expected by the middle of the month. "The IPO has created an interest for the stock market among the general people enabling liquidity inflow into the market," economist Abu Ahmed told bdnews24.com. But, the drawback is it could further overprice the already overheated market, added Ahmed, an adviser to the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission Bourse authorities however played down the concern, saying any capital market rises and falls. "Prices will always go above or below the justified level or else, there's no point for secondary market trading," says Dhaka Stock Exchange president Rakibur Rahman. The floatation would ease the supply constraint of the market, leading towards a justified price situation, he added. "The reason behind an overheated market is the lack of shares," he explained. Rahman urged the government to offload its entities and raise funds for projects like bridges and power through the capital market to ease the supply constraint. The IPO is likely to attract foreign investors to pour funds into the market, according to Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, who teaches finance at the University of Dhaka. "Foreign portfolio accounts for a meagre 4 percent; Floating of an MNC (multi-national corporation) would lure foreign investors in," said Khan, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange. According to The Economist magazine, foreigners have expressed interest in the company. An article in the latest issue said that until recently foreign companies have seen "little worth" buying in the Bangladeshi capital market, though investment can be made with few restrictions. "Their menu of options will expand if Grameenphone's successful offering inspires other firms," added the article. Since the middle of 2007, the market capitalisation has more than doubled and the daily average turnover has multiplied four times. But experts still find that the market lacks depth. "It accounts for only 16 percent of the GDP and still very much vulnerable to dwindling prices," said Zaid Bakht, who directs research at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. He, however, said the IPO of the largest mobile-phone services provider would change the country's equity scenario. "It would also encourage other MNCs in the country to go public causing increased foreign investment." Lottery of primary share allotments of Grameenphone (GP) were held on Oct 28 with total subscriptions over three times the issue target. Subscription to the Tk 4.86 billion offering that opened on Oct 4 created a stampede of investors. Though the subscription closed on Oct 8 for locals, NRBs had until Oct 18. The IPO attracted subscriptions worth Tk 17.25 billion from over one million prospective investors. The SEC on Aug 20 cleared GP to float 69,439,400 ordinary shares of Tk 10 each, in addition to a Tk 60 premium per share. The offer price values the company at only 3.3 times its 2008 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which created a buzz among investors. The pre-IPO or private placement of Tk 486.07 crore was completed in December last year. Norway's telecom giant Telenor owns 62 percent of Grameenphone, launched in 1997, while the local Grameen Telecom owns the rest.
