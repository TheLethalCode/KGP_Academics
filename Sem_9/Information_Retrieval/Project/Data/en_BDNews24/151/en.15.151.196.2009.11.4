 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Even some ten months after the parliamentary polls were held, the Election Commission is yet to post on its website all information on the candidates and accounts of their campaign expenses. There is no data on the EC website on election returns of the political parties either. Under the public representation order, there is a provision for hosting on the website all documents about the parties and the candidates for public information. Election commissioner Shakawat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, "It was not possible to put the information on the parties and candidates on the website for various reasons. But expenditures by the parties and candidates will come on the website soon." He resented the expenditure accounts submitted by the candidates though the limit for election expenses is determined. Shakawat said,"Despite proper application of the code of conduct for election, most of the candidates spent much above the limit set for the husting. But they submitted election expense accounts up to Tk 15 lakh each. In future, the EC will give emphasis on strict monitoring of election expenses" Under the public representation order 1972 , candidates will submit their accounts within 30 days of the election results gazetted and expenses are to be submitted in 90 days after the gazette notification. Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB), an international watchdog, in its research on political financing complained that in reality, there was no application of punitive measures against election expenses. The EC did not take any legal step against the candidates who did not submit the accounts of election expenses on time. TIB chairman M. Hafizuddin Khan, who was a former advisor to the caretaker government, on October 25 had said, "Statements on incomes and expenditures of political parties and candidates are subject to scrutiny. In fact, expenditures by political parties and candidates exceed the legally determined limits. But they submit their statements showing compliance with the legal limits. Because of lack of adequate infrastructure of the EC, it cannot monitor and take steps against parties and candidates giving wrong information". Some 1,567 candidates participated in the December 29, 2008, parliamentary election, of whom some 1,426 candidates contested from 38 political parties. There were 264 contestants from the Awami League, 260 from BNP, 167 from Islamic Andolan and one from Samyabadi Dal. The number of independent candidates was 151. EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Murshed told bdnews24.com that most of the candidates submitted their election expenses to the returning officers and their copies were forwarded to the Election Commission. He said, "Returning officers filed over 100 cases against candidates. Beside, EC is reviewing expenditures of the parties and candidates. At the same time, incomes and expenditures in the affidavits are also under scrutiny." So many cases were filed against candidates for the first time in the country, he observed. There is a provision of penalty ranging from 2 to 7 years imprisonment for not submitting election accounts on time, he said. The commission this time is determined to implement electoral laws though over 500 candidates anyway got away without submitting their actual election expenses. Calculating Tk 1.50 lakh per seat, a political party can spend taka 4.5 crore. It is the responsibility of the EC to make public the expenditures submitted by political parties. Syed Mohsin Reza, assistant programme officer (IT) of EC, told bdnews24.com, "Preparation is being taken to post all kinds of information on the website. We hope that information will go on the website in the first half of November." On October 25, CEC Shamsul Huda had told a seminar on political financing that a lot of talks were held on election results. While giving centre-wise results on the website, information of submission of returns was delayed. Information would go on the website shortly, he added. Meanwhile, allegations were brought against some 42 members of parliament for not submitting their income tax returns. EC officials said they were scrutinizing papers of some 14 MPs. If there is any anomaly or inconsistency, those would be sent to NBR for further investigation. b
