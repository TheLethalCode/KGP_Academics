 MARRAKESH, Morocco, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arab states are deeply disappointed that US-Israeli talks last week failed to produce greater pressure for a freeze on settlement-building, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said on Monday. "I am telling you that all of us, including Saudi Arabia, including Egypt, are deeply disappointed ... with the results, with the fact that Israel can get away with anything without any firm stand that this cannot be done," Moussa told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Morocco. Asked if U.S. President Barack Obama's drive to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had failed, he said, "I am really afraid that we are about to see a failure but I still wait until we have our meetings and decide what we are going to do. But failure is in the atmosphere all over."
