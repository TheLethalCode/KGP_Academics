 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has called upon industrial entrepreneurs to take moves for ensuring the welfare of their factory workers. "Take effective moves for the welfare of workers since they are toiling for your industries," she said on Thursday at the inauguration of the country's largest garments export fair, BATEXPO 2009. "Factory and workers are complementary to one another. If they live fine you also remain fine and decent," she said. Hasina asked the industrialists to work for public welfare. "Your main motive should not only to make profit, you also have a social responsibility to look after people's wellbeing." She asked the owners of BGMEA members to pay minimum wages to their factory workers. She said a certain quarter was conspiring against readymade garment industry. "We won't allow any evil force to be successful. The government is determined to protect garment industry. We have to find out the masterminds." The government is planning to introduce industrial police and industry intelligence team for the industrial zone, Hasina said. "The garment owners should maintain discipline in their factories. The government will provide them assistance." Prime minister Hasina praised the BGMEA for introducing rationing system in the garment factories. She asked other owners to introduce the system. Hasina reiterated the election pledge of providing job to at least one member of each family in national service. "It is not possible on part of the government alone to generate employment. Boost up your investment. We will help you. "We have to look for new markets. We cannot only depend on US and the European countries." The government is working for duty free access to the US market, she added. "To sustain in the competitive markets it is not only sufficient to manufacture cloths, you will have to bring modern design and fashion. She stressed increasing skills of the factory workers. "You will have to mingle the taste of foreign clients and local tradition." Hasina said the industrialists could not work in the last two years during the caretaker government regime as they had to face torture. She assured the BGMEA of assistance in setting up more training centres and transforming Institute of Fashion and Technology into a university. Hasina asked the finance minister to take steps for the rescheduling and rehabilitation of the 270 sick industries earmarked by the commerce ministry. Finance minister AMA Muhith asked the industrialists to be self reliant. "Since tax rate is the lowest in the garments sector you don't need to seek any scope here." "We do not want to keep any sick industry," he said. Commerce minister Faruq Khan assured the garment traders of fulfilling their demands in phases. LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam also attended the function. BGMEA's first vice president Nasir Uddin Chowdhury gave the welcome address at the function presided over by its chief Abdus Salam Murshedi. According to BGMEA, some 62 companies are participating this year's BATEXPO fair, many from UK, USA, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. There are some 86 stalls at the fair, on the sidelines of which a cultural night and fashion show would be held as part of the BATEXPO tradition. The closing ceremony of the fair will be held on Friday evening, even though the expo would run through to Saturday. Opposition chief Khaleda Zia will be chief guest at the closing function. A three-day knitwear exposition, KNITEXPO 2009, organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, ended earlier on Wednesday. b
