 Faridpur, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  RAB recovered nine firearms along with ammunition in a raid at the Faridpur home of a businessman on Thursday. Faridpur RAB-8 commander Maj Sabbir Rahman Osmani said his team, being tipped off, went with magistrate SM Ferdous to businessman Golam Rabbani Khan's home in the district town at around 4:30am. They broke open the gate and searched the house along with the caretaker and security guard. "Nine firearms were recovered from various points in the house," Osmani said. The RAB officer said he believed the arms were part of an illegal shipment. "Faridpur is known as one of the main transit points for arms smuggling," he said. "A network of illegal arms traders have been using Faridpur as a smuggling route over a long period. We are trying to close in on that network," said Osmani. Police arrested three people in the raid, caretaker Farid, 60, night guard Akmat Ali, 40, and the businessman's cousin Laskar, 30, who were all being quizzed, said the RAB officer. Faridpur Kotwali police chief Nur-e-Alam Siddiqui said Khan, known locally as a BNP supporter, was an accused in a murder case. He also said Khan, who has long lived in Dhaka, had previously contested municipality, upazila and parliamentary polls as an independent candidate. Siddiqui said a case was filed in connection with the arms seizure. bdn
