 Dhaka, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)Two senior government figures on Monday held the owner of a Tongi garment factory responsible for the three deaths in Saturday's incident of labour unrest. State minister for labour Mannujan Sufian said the garment factory owner must pay compensation for the victims of the clashes between workers and police at Tongi. The minister's comments came after Monday's meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on labour at the parliament premises. Chairman of the standing committee Israfil Alam told bdnews24.com that the owners "were responsible" for the death of three people. Saturday's incident of labour unrest was sparked as workers of Nippon Garments at Ershad Nagar in Tongi found the factory shut without notice. The ensuing demonstrations and violence left three dead and scores injured. "The owner cannot easily deny compensation to the victims," Sufian told bdnews24.com at parliament. She said her ministry would go for action after getting the report of the probe body, which was given 15 days to investigate. Alam also said the owners should pay the families of the dead and compensate the injured too. "If anyone says that the owners are not responsible for their deaths, it is untrue," he told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "They must be held responsible. If not for their actions, such an incident would not have taken place," he said. Earlier in the day, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had said garment factory owners must find the reason for widespread labour unrest in the industry. "No industry can sustain itself by suppressing the workers. The owners will have to find out the the causes of discontent among their workers," Hasina said on Monday, launching the Knit Exposition 2009 by BKMEA.
