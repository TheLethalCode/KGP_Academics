 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to establish cardiac patient care in all upazila health centres within four years, and raise average life expectancy to 70 years by 2021, the prime minister said Saturday. Arrangements will be made to provide primary treatment of heart disease patients in all upazila health complexes, emergency treatment in the district hospitals and specialised treatment including cardiac surgery in all medical college hospitals by 2013, Hasina said at the opening of a conference in the city. She was addressing the 1st international conference on congenital heart disease in children, organised by the Paediatric Cardiac Society of Bangladesh. Departments of cardiac care and heart surgery especially for children in Dhaka Shishu Hospital, BSMMU Hospital and government medical college hospitals would also be introduced on a priority basis, the prime minister said. Children's cardiac units would be expanded to other hospitals in phases, she said. Spelling out the government 2021 health goals, Hasina said the government's target was to raise longevity to 70 years by then. The average life expectancy at birth for both men and women in Bangladesh was between 64 years in 2007, according to Unicef. Hasina said raising longevity included tackling heart disease and curbing deaths from contagious disease. She said the government also aims to reduce neonatal mortality to 15 percent from the current 54 percent and maternal mortality to 1.5 percent from 3.8 percentall by 2021. The government is already working to ensure health services to rural areas with one community clinic for every 6,000 people, she said. "The process of appointing over 4,000 doctors on an emergency basis to do this is ongoing." The prime minister called on doctors to be sincere in their profession. "We hear sometimes that doctors, particularly of government hospitals, neglect their duties. Negligence in health care can cause deaths," she said. "You have to remember that a huge amount of money, from parents and guardians, goes towards one doctor's education and training." "The people and the country invest in you, so that they can in turn benefit from your service," she said. Among others, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, the prime minister's adviser Syed Modasser Ali and child specialist MR Khan also spoke. bdnew
