<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners Association on Sunday announced they would suspend operating their vehicles indefinite period from Nov 3, protesting extortion and related disturbances created by a section of transport workers. An emergency meeting of the association held on Saturday night at its central office at Gabtoli in the city decided to suspend plying vehicles on Dhaka-Bogra and Dhaka-Naogaon routes. The meeting identified Abdul Latif, a Bogra-based transport worker, as a notorious extortionist and said the notoriety of Latif and his cohorts became exacerbating. Latif and his companions have been forcibly closing down ticket counters of bus companies who have not paid the extortionists their fixed 'tolls', the bus owners said. For the last one week, much to the dismay of the passengers, some bus companies including Hanif Enterprise have kept their Dhaka-Bogra and Dhaka-Naogaon services suspended. Seeing no remedy in sight, BBTOA has at last announced that all bus operators plying vehicles on Dhaka-Bogra and Dhaka-Naogaon routes would stop operation from Nov 3 sine die if action is not taken against Abdul Latif by Nov 2. A BBTOA notification signed by its vice president M Humayun Kabir has been forwarded to the concerned officials at BRTA, IGP's office, RAB, and deputy commissioners of Bogra and Naogaon with a request to take necessary action against Latif. b
