<TITLE> Wave of support made me stay as captain - Younis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan captain Younis Khan has said though it had been a difficult time facing up to match-fixing allegations, the wave of support back home that followed after he offered to step down, persuaded him to stay in charge of the team, reports Cricinfo. "It started with the committee that called me," Younis said. "As for me, it was very hard to go there and answer their questions. If I'm being questioned on my performance or my team's performance then that's very easy, as that happens in every country, not just Pakistan.

I have no problems with my team, no problems with my country and no problems with my countrymen and I hope you'll see that in the coming days." Pakistan will be engaging New Zealand in a limited-overs series - three ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals - in the UAE, from Nov 3-13. While the ODIs have been scheduled for Abu Dhabi, Dubai will host the two Twenty20s. Younis, however, downplayed the notion that the upcoming clash was a chance to avenge the defeat in the Champions Trophy. "It's not (a revenge series) but all the Pakistan players have it in their minds, if possible, to beat New Zealand," Younis said. "In cricket and sport there is no revenge, but we won't forget that l
