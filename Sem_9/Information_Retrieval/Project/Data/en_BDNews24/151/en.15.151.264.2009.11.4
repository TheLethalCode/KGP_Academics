 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Wednesday passed a law allowing inexperienced individuals and firms to compete in tenders for public works or purchase of goods or services worth up to Tk 2 crore. The amendment to pubic procurement law is believed to open the floodgates to corruption and partisanship in government procurement. Jobs up to Tk 2 crore will be awarded through lottery without any insistence on pre-qualification, which, many fear, would offer outlets to ruling party adherents. The Public Procurement (Second Amendment) Bill 2009, placed by the planning minister AK Khandaker on Nov 1, passed by voice vote in the House. The boycotting opposition lawmakers have given notices eliciting public opinion on the bill, which was vetted by the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry but their proposals were not discussed due to their absence. The BNP has alleged that the government's move was designed to institutionalise manipulation in the procurement process after the cabinet approved the draft bill recently. The World Bank and other lenders have also objected to the government's move, fearing that the quality of public works might fall due to such measures. They also said that liberalising the law would encourage corruption in public procurement expenditure, which was worth over $3 billion per annum in Bangladesh. "We will not allow the quality of the public sector to fall," Khander told parliament as the only opposition MP Fazlul Azim alleged that the bill will encourage corruption. "The bill will not spread corruption in the public sector." The law provides for disqualification of contractors if they quote more than 5 percent above or below the government's estimated costs for a domestic purchase of up to Tk 2 core. Experts say contractors in many cases quote rates up to 30 percent less than government estimates to secure a lucrative public sector contract through the lowest bid. This is considered one of the main causes of poor standard of works and services in the public sector. Post and telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu piloted The Post Office (Amendment) Bill 2009 in the House, to bring private mailing operators and courier services under a legal framework. The bill was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications for further examination. bd
