 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has sought the support of the European Union for rehabilitation of the refugees due to climate change. There should be an independent fund at the United Nations to counter climate changes and it ought to be not mixed with the development funds, she told a five-member EU delegation team on Sunday. Also, she called for setting up of a climate adaptation centre in Dhaka, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said after the meeting. She insisted on the demand for compensation for climate change to be raised jointly, said Azad. Everybody should remain vigilant because more countries like Bangladesh will be affected in the future, she said. Research is going on to prevent salinity for climate change. Major rivers are being dredged to increase their depth, she told the delegates. The team members lauded her speeches and suggestions to tackle the climate change effects at recent international conferences. British MP Nirj Deva and Jean Lambart, German MP Franzisca Keller, Italian MP Noccolo Rinaldi and Malta's MP John Attard Montalto met with her Sunday morning. Later, Cirdap director general Durga P Paudyal met with her. She informed the prime minister about the upcoming Cirdap conference in January and discussed steps to counter climate change at the village level. Hasina gave a speech on climate change at the plenary session of European Development Day titled `Climate Change: The Road to Copenhagen and Beyond', at Swedish capital Stockholm. bd
