 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnew24.com)The government has stretched the deadline for filing income tax returns by 12 more days, some three hours to the cut-off time on Sunday, after refusing such move. The National Board of Revenue in a circular confirmed the extension of the deadline for a second time to Nov 12 after speculations of not extending the deadline. The NBR extended the deadline by one month on Sep 29. As the Oct 31 deadline falls on a weekend day, Saturday, returns were to be received until 8pm on Sunday. Income tax law stipulates that individual tax payers can submit their returns up to September-end, but deadline is invariably extended every year. Last year, the deadline was extended twice to Nov 30. NBR chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed at 5pm told reporters, "This is not my decision. I just implemented what the government has decided." Regarding reports of extension in several news media before the official announcement, Ahmed told bdnews24.com at around 4pm, "No decision has been made yet. We will take necessary steps if the government feels it should be extended." The circular also said, "The deadline has been stretched following demands from different groups and organisations." The income tax office will be open on Nov 7, Saturday, to facilitate the taxpayers. The date would not be extended anymore, the circular added. NBR chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed declared on Oct 28 that the deadline would not be extended further under any circumstances. The taxpayers started gathering at the tax offices on the last day. Finance minister A M A Muhith told reporters at his office at around 11:30am on Sunday: "Please wait until 1 in the afternoon. It will be made known whether the deadline will be extended or not. The NBR chief then saw the minister at his office. At around 1:30pm, Muhith told the waiting media crew, "Let's see how many tax returns are submitted until the afternoon." "But personally I think the deadline should not be extended." Nasiruddin told bdnews24.com on Saturday: "A huge number have submitted their returns towards the end of deadline. The offices were overflowing with people on Saturday," he said. "The tax payers this year will far outnumber the 7.39 lakh of last year," the NBR chief had said. The number of TIN holders in the country is over 22 lakh. Seven lakh and 39 thousand returns were submitted last year. NBR is expecting that this year it will be more than that. A total of Tk 13,812.16 crore was earned from individual income tax returns in the last fiscal year while the target for revenue earnings from the sector is Tk 16,500 crore in the current fiscal year. The government says it wants to take the number to Tk 20,000 crore. bdnews
