<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Monday unanimously adopted a resolution censuring the Oct 21 bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said her government would root out those responsible for the attack on Taposh, at any cost, to hand them exemplary punishment. She also renewed her assault on the opposition on Monday, telling them to stop supporting "bomb attackers and killers". "I urge the opposition parties to refrain from such heinous activities," Hasina said in parliament as MPs discussed the censure motion. Hasina said the Leader of the Opposition (Khaleda Zia) could have condemned the attack on Taposh, "an orphan". "Why is she so shy of condemning the attack?" questioned the prime minister. Taposh's parents were killed alongside Hasina's father and the country's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. Taposh is also Hasina's nephew. She termed the attackers "beasts" and said, "The whole nation will show hatred for them." "I support this censure motion and urge parliament to endorse it". Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta moved the censure motion on Monday; 26 MPs took part in the discussion which ran for 2 hours and 52 minutes. Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim said the BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman was involved in Bangabandhu's killing. "Didn't Ziaur Rahman proclaim the indemnity ordinance to save the killers and himself? "Didn't he appoint the killers of Bangabandhu as ambassadors in foreign missions?" said Selim, who is Sheikh Mujib's nephew, Hasina's cousin and Taposh's uncle. He said the involvement of Ziaur Rahman in the killing of Bangabandhu "would be clearer in the days to come". Selim said the people of Bangladesh would resist any future move "to overthrow an elected government by military dictators". Suranjit Sengupta termed the attack on Taposh as an attack on the country's democracy and constitutionality. Parliament unanimously adopted the censure resolution, though the opposition was absent. The main opposition BNP has been abstaining from parliament for most of the year, due to a seating dispute and what they term "a hostile environment" created by the ruling party. bdn
