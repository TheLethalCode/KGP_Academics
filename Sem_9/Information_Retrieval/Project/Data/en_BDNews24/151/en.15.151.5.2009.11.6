 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)The Nov 7, 1975 'soldier-people uprising' led by Col Abu Taher who propounded an innovative revolution theory in Indian sub-continent fell flat because of some philosophical flaws, educationist professor Sirajul Islam said. "Army is one of the institutions bourgeois states stand on but Taher wanted to launch a revolution with the help of military," he said at a discussion marking 34th anniversary of the uprising at the TSC of Dhaka University on Friday. The trend was unprecedented in Indian sub-continent, he said "Some local agents of imperialism tactfully became a part of the revolution and foiled the mission by transforming the revolution into counter-revolution," he said In the keynote paper, Shomokal executive editor Abu Sayeed Khan said, "Democracy in Bangladesh dominated by dynastic rule, petty party politics, muscle force, fundamentalism and communalism is limping along." He said, "Imperialism is so overpowering that political parties cannot run independently." Jatiya Samajtrantic Dal vice-president Sharif Nurul Ambia said, "Like the trials of Bangabandhu murder and war criminal, the trial of Taher murder is needed to restore democracy." Workers Party (Reform) convener Haidar Akbar Khan Rono said, "The two major political parties are cashing in on revolution led by Taher." He also said, "One party wants to obliterate the name of Taher from history though it observes the day as 'National Revolution and Solidarity Day' while the other calls a black day." Professor of economics department at Dhaka University MM Akash said, "Real democracy cannot be established in any country without driving away imperialism." Chaired by vice-president of Col Taher Sangsad, professor Anwar Hossain, the function was among others addressed by Bangaldesh Chhatra League (JSD) president Hossain Ahmed Tafsir. bdn
