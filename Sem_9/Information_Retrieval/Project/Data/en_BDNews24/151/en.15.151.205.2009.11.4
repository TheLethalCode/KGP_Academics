<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh can draw huge Japanese investment now as the investors plan to relocate production units to a country other than China, Japan's ambassadorhas said. Talking to reporters on Wednesday, Tamotsu Shinotsuka said Dhaka should provide more information about Bangladesh's cheap labour and big market to the Japanese investors so that they could pick Bangladesh. He, however, said Bangladesh should shed its poor image of a country of natural calamities. "Right now, Japanese are very much dependent on China for its domestic supplies," Shitonsuka told journalists at "Meet the Reporters" at Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium. "Japanese companies want to divert their production bases to a country from China as per our 'China plus one' policy. "Bangladesh can be one of the potential countries to get selected for the Japanese production base," he said. The Japanese ambassador said Bangladesh's positive sides were its huge market and trained human resources. "The labour costs in Bangladesh is lower than those in China, Thailand and Vietnam," said Shinotsuka. "Frankly speaking, information about Bangladesh is not disseminated easily. "So, you provide information as much as possible to the Japanese investors," the envoy suggested . He said Bangladeshis were 'very much friendly' to the Japanese. As per the government figures, Japanese companies have investment of $1.2 billion and Japan is the sixth largest investor in Bangladesh. Japan was hit hard by the global economic recession. Like the western investors, the Japanese companies are interested in diverting their investment to different locations. Bangladesh is one of the few countries that were insulated from the heat of the global financial slowdown. He said Bangladesh's political situation is "stable" and the government was going in the right direction to woo the Japanese investors. "It is a good sign that the government is trying to attract the Japanese investors through establishing export processing zones." However, Shinotsuka said, poor infrastructure and power crises were the major constraints which could hamper foreign investment. "Your roads and bridges are not good," he said. He said his country provided $10 billion as development assistance to many sectors including communications. "Japan provides the largest development assistance to Bangladeshmore than the combined contribution of the US and the UK," said Shinotsuka. He said his country would continue to support Bangladesh in its development efforts in the days to come.
