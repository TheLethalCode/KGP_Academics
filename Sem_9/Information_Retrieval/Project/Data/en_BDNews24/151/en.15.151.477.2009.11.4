<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government will review its promotion policy to repair an administration "in ruins", local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, in charge of the establishment ministry, said Wednesday. "We are actively considering a more up-to-date promotion policy to ensure transparent promotions and a dynamic administration," Ashraful said, answering a written query from ABM Golam Mostafaa, MP for Comilla-4. He also observed that a skilled administration and manpower cannot be built up by appointing people considering their party affiliation. The current Promotion Policy dates back to 2002, he added. Answering another query from the same MP, he said the past four-party alliance government "ruined the administration" by appointing and promoting people considering their party affiliation. "The administration is now in an awful state. The BNP-Jamaat government ruined it." Criticising various actions of that government, he said, "Party cadres were employed during the alliance government  They employed the self-confessed killers of Bangabandhu  the PSC's questions were also leaked out." "The present government is working to formulate policies with an aim to build up a party-neutral, transparent and skilled administration." Replying to a supplementary query from senior ruling party MP Suranjit Sengupta, of Sunamganj-2, Ashraf said, "It is not possible to implement government policies if the administration is not skilled and party-neutral." "The skilled and competent administrators should be appointed to the eligible and important posts." In answer to a query from Junaid Ahmed Palak, MP for Natore-3, Ashraf said the government has no plans for now to stop contractual appointments, The contractually appointed officials have been carrying out their duty properly as well as working to implement government policy, he said. "There is a possibility of stagnation in the civil administration if these contractual appointments are stopped." "The concerned officials are appointed in line with laws. Under the circumstance, there is a little possibility for junior officials to be deprived of promotion amid the contractual appointments." bdnews24.com/s
