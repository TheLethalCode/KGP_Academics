<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court ended hearing arguments of the prosecution in Bangabandhu murder case appeals for the day on Wednesday. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the 23rd day's hearing at around 9:45am, and ended at 1.35pm, with chief state counsel Anisul Haque presenting his arguments. The prosecution started its deliberations on Monday. On Tuesday, Haque had justified the trial of the case under civil law, saying no mutiny had taken place on Aug 15, 1975. The defence counsels claimed that the gory event took place as part of a widespread rebellion in the army. Haque finished his presentations on the late filing of the case, one of the five points. On Oct 5, the freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975.
