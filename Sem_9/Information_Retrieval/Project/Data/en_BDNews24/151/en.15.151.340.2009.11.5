 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) -- The Supreme Court ended hearing arguments from the prosecution in Bangabandhu murder case appeals for the day on Thursday. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began the 24th day's hearing at around 9:45am with chief state counsel Anisul Haque presenting his arguments. It ended at 1:35pm. Haque had told the apex court at the previous day's hearing that the purpose of Aug 15, 1975 conspiracy was to kill president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members, not to topple the government or usurp state power. The prosecution started its deliberations on Monday. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975.
