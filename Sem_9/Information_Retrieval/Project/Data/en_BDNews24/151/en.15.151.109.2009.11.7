 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)--Ruling Awami League-backed Swadhinata Chikitshak Parishad (Sachip) has swept Thursday's violence-marred elections to Bangladesh Medical Association amid boycott by the opposition. BMA Election Commission announced the results on Friday pending the results outside Dhaka and Chittagong. Opposition BNP-backed Doctors Association of Bangladesh, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed National Doctors Forum and JSD-backed Bangladesh Chikitshak Parisad pulled out at the last minute alleging irregularities in the election process. Dr Mahmud Hasan and Dr Sharfuddin Ahmed have been elected president and secretary general as the AL-backed doctors rode back to office after seven years. As many as 41 executive posts and 252 central councilor were up for grabs, for which Sachip and Communist Party of Bangladesh-backed Doctors for Health and Environment panels ran jointly.
