 KABUL, Nov 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah pulled out of on election run-off on Sunday after accusing the government of not meeting his demands for a fair vote, but said he was not calling for a boycott. Pressure had been growing on Abdullah to withdraw from the contest against President Hamid Karzai, seen by analysts as favorite to win the run-off after getting the most votes in the fraud-marred first round on August 20. "I will not take part in the election ... I have not taken this decision easily," Abdullah told supporters in Kabul, adding he had not told anyone to boycott the November 7 ballot. Karzai's campaign said the run-off would go ahead despite Abdullah's withdrawal.

Abdullah was speaking in Kabul to tribal elders gathered in a huge tent in the west of the capital.

The issue for Abdullah now is how does he withdraw: by saving face gracefully or boycotting the run-off," one Western official in Kabul, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Analysts and diplomats believe withdrawing from the contest, perhaps as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a top government post in Karzai's next government, would spare the country further political pain and insurgent violence. But Karzai's campaign team said it would go ahead anyway. While behind-the-scenes diplomatic moves to resolve the deadlock intensified over the past week, one Western diplomatic source said talks between Karzai and his former foreign minister Abdullah had broken down. The run-off was triggered when a UN-led investigation found widespread fraud, mainly in favor of Karzai, had been committed during the first ro
