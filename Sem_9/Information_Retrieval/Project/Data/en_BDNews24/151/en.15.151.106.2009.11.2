 RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed in a bomb blast in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi on Monday, officials said. "We have information that 15 to 20 people have been killed," said Rana Sanaullah, Punjab's law minister who is also responsible for security of the province. BBC said, the explosion occurred within the Chaklala military cantonment area, near the Pearl Continental hotel. Security in the area is controlled by the army. Local television footage showed ambulances and rescue workers at the scene of the blast. More than 100 people were killed after a huge car bomb ripped through a busy market in Peshawar last week. Similar attacks have killed hundreds of people in recent weeks, as the army carries out an operation against Taliban militants in South Waziristan. It is still unclear what caused Monday's explosion. It took place near the Pearl Continental and Shalimar hotels in a busy area of the city. "It was a huge blast. I saw smoke rising from one of the buildings. I sped up to escape," witness Sajid Khan told a Pakistani television station. bdnews24.com/lq/14
