 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Production-sharing contracts with ConocoPhillips for sea blocks 10 and 11 and Tullow for 5 are under process, the energy minister said in parliament on Thursday. "There are possibilities of oil and gas discovery in these blocks," Enamul Haque said in his reply to a written question from reserve MP Begum Noor-e-Hasna Lily Chowdhury. He said PSCs will not be any leasing agreement; the government will own all moveable and immoveable properties. A parliamentary standing committee on Oct 15 differed with the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources, Power and Ports which in a 'draft bill' sought a ban on gas and coal exports for the next 50 years. The pressure group of left-leaning politicians and professionals asked the parliamentary standing committee on energy ministry to recommend cancellation of the Model Production Sharing Contract (PSCs) with foreign oil companies and invite fresh tenders for gas blocks bidding. Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah, convenor of the National Committee, told reporters that his team had specifically pointed out at the meeting that the PSC had gas export provision. Standing committee chairman Subid Ali Bhuiyan said the Model PSC-2008 did not contain any specific provision for export. He said as per the PSC-2008, the international oil companies would first offer Petrobangla if it could explore gas in the Bay. It would sell gas, Bhuiyan said, to the local market if the Petrobangla refused buying the same. The military-installed interim government in 2008 signed an agreement with US ConocoPhillips and Irish company Tullow Oil for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. The cabinet in August approved the proposal to award ConocoPhilips and Tullow contracts to explore oil and gas in three offshore blocks. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. The government will soon sign the PSCs with the two companies soon, energy ministry sources say. The National Committee is protesting against the deals which it claims would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee is confusing the public on the issue with such false information. The National Committee called a general strike in capital Dhaka on Sept 2 protesting the government's move for "oil and gas export". bdnews24.c
