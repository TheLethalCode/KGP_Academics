 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)The nation wants to purge the curse of the assassination of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman by completing the trial, the chief prosecution counsel said on Monday. The Supreme Court began hearing arguments from the prosecution at the hearing of Bangabandhu murder appeals by death convicts. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by justice Md Tafazzal Islam ended the hearing for the day at 1:40pm that began at 9:45am. Anisul Haque, the chief counsel, said: "The killing of Bangabandhu has changed the country's history. The nation wants the trial for the killing. The country wants to get rid of the stain. He said the trail was crucial to the country's march towards the rule of law by getting out of disorder. After Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel of the convicts Syed Faruq Rahman and A K M Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer) ended his presentation on Monday morning, Haque began presenting his arguments at 10:15am. The defence presentations ended on Monday morning on the 21st day of the hearing. Haque said in the hearing : "The nation's founding father and then president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed. Seven of his family members including his 10-year old son Russel were also killed. "These convicts along with other army officers heinously killed them." He said: "The impact of the killing is extends from the individual life to the national life. This killing did not only change the lives of the family members of those who were killed, but also changed the course of the nation's history. "The nation is awaiting remedy through trial of the killing. "The final stage of the trial represents a big step in the journey towards discipline from disorder in our national life." Citing various examples of killing across the world, the chief state counsel said: "The world has witnessed killings of many heads of nation and trials of those killings. "US president Abraham Lincoln was killed on April 14, 1865 and the trial was held within three years. India's Mahatma Gandhi was killed on Jan 30, 1948 and the trial was completed in less than two years. "Indira Gandhi was killed on Oct 31, 1984 and the trial was finished in 1988. "People of our country have seen the fragrant humiliation of the law. The country is now trying to return to the rule of law from that precarious condition through the trial of [Sheikh Mujib's killing] for the last 13 years." Haque told reporters after the hearing: "The Appellate Division received the appeal hearing in the case on three points. "One of them was that the third (High Court) judge had made an error of judgement by only resolving on six convicts without analysing the full content of the split verdict given by the two previous High Court judges. "I have started my presentations in reply to the point of the defence. "The point of the defence is that the third judge should have analysed the total verdict. In my argument I have presented examples between 1910 and 2006 in the (Indian) sub-continent. "I said section 378 of the criminal procedure code has given directions about the authority of the third judge in such circumstances. The section says the third judge will hear and resolve as much as s/he considers appropriate. "This is the unanimous power of the third judge. The law has granted him/her the power. Haque continued: "The opinion of the third judge will be reflected in the ruling. Until the third judge gives any opinion/view the split verdict of the High Court will be considered as opinion. "The ruling of the third judge will be given priority under the circumstance." "The third judge handed down his ruling through proper application of the law. He heard both the parties before giving his verdict. "This is the main ruling. He did not do anything illegal by handing down the verdict. "The third judge gave his ruling based on hearing of six convicts since there was difference of opinion between the two High Court judges about them. Presenting the examples of the US and UK about split verdict, Haque said: "The verdict of the trial court is upheld in case of split verdict of the High Court in the US. "(However), There is no such scope in the UK because three High Court judges hear appeals there. The opinion of the majority is considered as ruling," Haque explained. On Oct 5, the freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences for hanging the accused in the case for the assassination of the first president and independence hero on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer).
