 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)The government has approved the 'One House, One Farm' scheme, initiated by previous 1996 Awami League government, at the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) meeting on Thursday. The four year-long project cost has been set at Tk 11.97 billion and will be implemented in 9,640 villages. Some 28,92,000 people from 5,78,400 families will be benefited from the project, planning minister A K Khandaker told reporters after the meeting, headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The project will be implemented with government fund through 'village organisations', comprising 30 to 40 percent women, which will be formed in 9,640 villages under 1,928 unions. It will cover 482 upazilas of the 64 districts. The project was first approved on Jan 2, 2001, to be effective from July 2000-June 2005, at a cost of Tk 2.5 billion . But the succeeding BNP-Jamaat government on June 22, 2002 changed the project name. The minister said, "The Awami League in its election manifesto pledged to launch the project. The approval has been made to keep the promise. "We have re-launched the scheme to bring the rural people into the mainstream of the economy." A country's overall progress depends on the development in the rural areas and the project in the past had significantly contributed to the improvement of rural economy, Khandaker said. "But we do not realise why the BNP government hindered the excellent project," he added. bdn
