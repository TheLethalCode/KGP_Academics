<TITLE> BNP MPs can't join for leadership row: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP MPs have not been able to join the parliament session even though they are willing to due to their leadership trouble, the prime minister said on Wednesday. Sheikh Hasina, during her question-answer session, said: " The opposition MPs don't attend parliament. They remain in the parliament invisibly. "The general MPs intend to come to parliament. We assume that they cannot perhaps due to problems in the leadership." The second question was from BNP MP for Chittagong-15 Zafrul Islam Chowdhury. His query was placed by MP for Kishoreganj-3 Mujibul Haque at the request of speaker Abdul Hamid. Before the question was raised, speaker Hamid said, "MPs of the opposition party don't come to parliament, but send queries. Again they phone me to say who will present their query. They also give the name." The BNP started staying off parliament from Jan 28, the second day of the first session, over a dispute over seating arrangements with the ruling coalition. The parliament resumed its adjourned third session on Oct 4, with the main opposition apparently likely to continue to boycott the proceedings. bdnews24.c
