 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar has filed two petitions in the High Court seeking sanctions to be quizzed at jail gate and for proper medical treatment. Mahbubuuddin Khokan, lawyer for Babar, told bdnews24.com the petition was filed with the bench of justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mamnun Rahman on Sunday. The CID police took the ex-BNP state minister for home on remand in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade blast case. The Supreme Court on Thursday put a seven-day halt on a High Court stay order regarding remanding Babar. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, serving 17 years on an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. b
