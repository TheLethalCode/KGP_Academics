 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Bank governor has called on the government to share climate change funds, from donor countries and agencies, with the central bank to help finance adaptation projects. Governor Atiur Rahman was speaking after a deal signing between the central bank and National Credit and Commerce Bank for a refinancing scheme targeting green projects. The Tk 200 crore refinancing scheme for installing solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants was initiated in August. NCC Bank signed an agreement on Monday to become the first participating bank in the scheme. "The central bank created the scheme to help overcome power and gas crises by supporting alternative green energy sources." "The central bank is looking to launch more environment-friendly refinancing schemes to fight effects of climatic change." Atiur Rahman said he hoped the government would allocate climate change funds donated to Bangladesh for such schemes by the central bank. He also urged banks not to give loans for projects harmed the environment such as filling rivers, building illegal structures and polluting industries. Under the new refinancing scheme, the central bank will give loans at an interest rate of five percent to banks, who in turn will add up to another five percent interest for loans to entrepreneurs for solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants. The interest rates on loans in these three sectors will be no more than 10 percent under any circumstances. The central bank's green energy policy also states that up to 100 percent refinancing will be available for installing solar panels and solar voltaic connection plants in businesses and homes. Banks are allowed to give loans of up to Tk 70,000 for installing solar panels in rural areas and Tk 175,000 in urban areas. The loan limit for establishing solar voltaic connection plants will depend on the wattage. According to the central bank's green energy policy, solar panels in urban areas may range from 170-520W and for rural areas, 10-130W. SM Moniruzzaman, director general of BB, and Mohammed Nurul Amin, managing director of NCC Bank, signed the refinancing deal on Monday at the central bank's Motijheel office. bd
