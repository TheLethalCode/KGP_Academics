<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)A committee has been formed to make recommendations for launching of trade unions in the readymade garment factories in line with the labour law . The 12-strong committee is headed by the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment ministry, Israfil Alam. Five representatives from both the owners and workers' groups each are on the committee. Labour and employment secretary has been selected the member secretary. The decision came from a tripartite meeting at the ministry on Sunday after an agreement of the owners and workers following the Saturday's clashes at Tongi . At least three people died and around 100 were injured as police and workers of Nippon Garment Factory clashed. Police on Sunday confirmed the third death. They had finally confirmed deaths of two others almost 12 hours after the media had reported. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, Israfil Alam, labour secretary Ataharul Islam, Jatiya Sramik League president Abdul Matin Master, general secretary Roy Ramesh Chandra and other workers' leaders attended the meeting chaired by the labour and employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain. Hossain said the committee will submit its report as early as possible. At least one union will be established in every factory after the recommendations are placed, he added. The minister said, "Only 175 factories among around 3,500 in the country have 'participatory committees' where the workers are not included in a systematic way. "So trade unions should be established to ensure workers' participation." He called Saturday's clash as 'unfortunate', adding that the incident will be thoroughly investigated and no-one will be spared according to an instruction from the prime minister. The layoff by the garment facotory was not appropriate, he said. "The matter is under investigation. The government will take measures if there was any negligence on the part of the owners. But the possible involvement of a third party will be look into first." He asked all to identify the persons wearing helmets and lungi, who he said were 'not workers'. "Workers do not go to the factories wearing 'lungi'. We have to find out through investigations who had backed the workers." Families of the deceased will be provided compensation from the owners' side and families of the affected will also be rehabilitated, the minister added. bdnew
