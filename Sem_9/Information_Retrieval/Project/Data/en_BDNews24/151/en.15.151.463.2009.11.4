 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)--The purpose of Aug 15, 1975 conspiracy was to kill president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family, not to topple the government or usurp state power, the prosecution said on Wednesday. The Supreme Court heard the arguments from chief state counsel Anisul Haque at the 23rd day's hearing in Bangabandhu murder case appeals. "Bangabandhu was shot without any provocation or question," Haque said. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing at around 9:45am, and ended at 1.35pm. Haque said the Bangabandhu family was brave. They did not beg their lives. "Seeing Bangabandhu's body in the stairway Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib said, 'Kill me here.' "She wanted to save others inside the house. She did not beg her life. Even (youngest son) Sheikh Russel did not plead to be spared, he only wanted to go to his mother. "If the design was to usurp state power then vice president Syed Nazrul Islam and prime minister Monsur Ali would have been attacked as well. "But their houses were not attacked. Attack was carried at the houses of Abdur Rob Serniabat and Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Serniabat was Bangabandhu's brother-in-law and Moni was the nephew. "Then the killers attacked Bangabandhu's house. He was not asked anything. He was shot without any provocation or question. "If the conspiracy was to oust the government Bangabandhu would have been questioned that day. "Bangabandhu was the president. A Major requires permission to access the president's house. "The killers did not take any permission to enter the house," Haque said. "Ten-year old Russel did not anything to do with power. The killers did not spare him even. This proves that their only purpose was to kill the Bangabandhu's family and his relatives. "The killers hoped the four national leaders would support them after the killing. Since they did not do so they were arrested within one week of Bangabandhu's killing. "Nothing was said about arresting Bangabandhu before killing him. Referring to witness Abdul Quddus' testimony, Haque said: "Bazlul Huda shot Sheikh Kamal dead. "When Bangabandhu came downstairs and asked them, 'What do you want?' Captain Huda and Major Noor Mohammad shot him without giving any reply. "There was no talk about government change. There was only 'sound of gunfire'." Mentioning section 10 of Evidence Act, the chief state counsel said: "The whole event was preplanned and part of a conspiracy. "It was clear in the testimonies of witnesses Sirajul Haque, dafader Abdul Jabbar Mridha, habilder Aminur Rahman and nayek Md Yasin. "According to criminal procedure code conspiracy is also a punishable crime. "It is proved from the testimonies of the four witnesses that convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Col Abdur Rashid gave speeches addressing the soldiers in Balurghat. Maj Dalim, who lost his job from the army, was also there. "The soldiers were not told about the murder plan. If they were told directly they would not agree to go. "Maj Dalim told the soldiers, 'We have liberated the country. The government cannot protect the chastity of our mothers and sisters. People are dying from starvation. This government should be ousted.' "This speech proves that it was a conspiracy to kill. "They (the soldiers) were even asked not to shy away from firing. Their (the plotters) only target was Bangabandhu and his family. They divided the soldiers into several groups to kill Bangabandhu." The court said defence counsel barrister Abdullah Al Mamun had been asked not to make such statements about the unfolding of the events. "Give your statement regarding some legal queries. We need to know the replies to legal queries," the court said. Haque said no point from the beginning to the end of the plot would be considered for trial. "One High Court judge did not accept the confessional statements because of some faults. Another judge accepted them. Nobody except the conspirator can give testimony about the conspiracy The court asked him whether the confessional statement could be tried under section 10 of Evidence act. Another state counsel Ajmalul Hossain QC said in the reply confessional statement was defined as a kind of self realisation and confession produced from repentance. "The statements given by Syed Faruk Rahman and Shahriar Rashid Khan were appropriate in line with Evidence Act," he said. The prosecution started its deliberations on Monday. On Oct 5 the freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer).
