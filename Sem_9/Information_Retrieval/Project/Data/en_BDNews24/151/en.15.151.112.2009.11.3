<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's government has averted a potentially destabilising coalition split by abandoning a bid to get parliamentary approval for an amnesty from graft charges for the president and other senior politicians. The amnesty, introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf in 2007 in a bid to strike a power-sharing deal with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was to be debated in parliament this week as the government struggles with a surge in militant violence. Musharraf introduced the National Reconciliation Order (NRO) by decree, but the Supreme Court said in July that it had to be approved by parliament. It hit a hurdle, however, when opposition politicians -- and some members of a coalition led by President Asif Ali Zardari's party -- said they would vote against the order, which they said legitimised corruption. The 2007 order cleared the way for Bhutto to return from self-imposed exile and take part in a general election by granting her amnesty from presection on graft charges. She was assassinated two months after returning but her husband, Zardari, went on to lead her party to victory in February 2008 polls and to become president later that year. Zardari spent years in jail on corruption charges but was never convicted. He said the charges were politically motivated. Opposition to parliamentary approval for the amnesty could have driven rifts in the coalition, with one key partner even suggesting Zardari step down over the issue. Opposition members of parliament shouting anti-Zardari slogans walked out of the National Assembly on Monday evening vowing to block the order. Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, a top member of Zardari's party, then told the assembly the government would try to forge a consensus on the order before presenting it to parliament. "We have made sacrifices for this political system and we want to keep it intact," Gilani told the National Assembly. "We will not let it to be derailed," he said. STOCK INVESTORS WARY The withdrawal of the order from parliament will not open Zardari to any immediate corruption prosecutions, but accusations still hang over him and could provide his political enemies with ammunition. The NRO cleared all graft charges against politicians and civil servants laid before October 1999 when Musharraf seized power in a military coup. It favoured members of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party but not the other main party, led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was hit with graft charges he said were politically motivated after he was overthrown in October 1999. Sharif, who also opposed parliamentary approval of the NRO, is seen as likely to emerge as the biggest challenger to Zardari's party in the next election, due by 2013. The re-emergence of political wrangling would dismay the United States and other allies. A crisis over the judiciary preoccupied leaders early this year when Taliban militants were aggressively pushing towards the capital. An exasperated United States said at the time the government appeared to be "abdicating" to the militants Shortly after that the army began an offensive in the northwest which was expanded last month to the militants' main South Waziristan base area on the Afghan border. The militants have retaliated with a series bomb attacks, killing hundreds of people. Worries about a revival of political infighting as well as security concerns led to a 3.13 percent slide in Pakistan's main stock market on Monday. The market was 0.40 percent up at 8,907.77 at 0651 GMT on Tuesday but in low vol
