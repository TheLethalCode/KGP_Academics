 Tongi, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Sunday formed a five-member probe committee headed by the labour secretary following Saturday's violent clashes between police and workers of a Tongi garment factory. The Tongi police filed a case against about 2,000 unidentified workers. The decision of the committee formation was taken in a tripartite meeting of the government, garment owners and workers. The committee was asked to submit its findings within 15 days, home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters. The home ministry, BGMEA, BKMEA and labour leaders were included in the committee. Tongi police chief Tapan Chandra Singha told bdnews24.com that police filed a case after the Saturday's clashes with Tongi police station. "The case has been filed against some 2,000 unidentified people on charges of vandalism, arson and obstructing police in performing their duties," Singh said. At least two people died and scores were injured as police and workers of Nippon Garment Factory clashed on Saturday. Authorities finally confirmed the deaths almost 12 hours after the deaths were first reported by the media. Locals said workers of Nippon Garments in Ershad Nagar demonstrated at the factory over unpaid dues. Workers said they had three months' salaries outstanding with the company which, the management had said they would be paid Saturday. But on the appointed day, that is, Saturday, they said, they found the factory shut down overnight with a notice hanging with "closed due to economic depression from Oct 31 to Nov 29" message at the gate. The workers were instructed to collect their pay on Nov 10. bdnews2
