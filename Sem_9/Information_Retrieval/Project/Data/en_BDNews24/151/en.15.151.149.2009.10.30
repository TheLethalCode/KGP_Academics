 LONDON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympic and world sprint champion Usain Bolt believes the tainted image athletics has acquired after several high-profile drugs cases in the past few years will clear as time goes by. "It'll take a couple of years for people to start believing that we are actually clean.
