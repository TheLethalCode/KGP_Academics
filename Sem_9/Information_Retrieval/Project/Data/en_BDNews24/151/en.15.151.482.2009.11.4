 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has received renewed pledges of support on climate change adaptation from visiting delegations of the European Union and the UK, ahead of the Copenhagen climate conference in December. The eight member EU delegation suggested Tuesday that Bangladesh move forward with specific projects to get financial assistance for adpatation. European parliament member Nirij Deva said that the EU is committed to help front liners in the list of worst hit countries. "Bangladesh needs financial assistance as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. But moving forward with specific goals is important to get this assistance," Nirij told a press conference at the Brac Center Inn. "Although we are ready to give Bangladesh all-out support to fight the adverse effects of climate change, we do not want to give any country a blank cheque." Whatever role the US plays in the upcoming Copenhagen Conference on climate changes, the EU will stand by Bangladesh and other developing states, said Nirij, referring to the US's previously uncooperative stance on global agreements for binding emissions cuts. The EU delegation arrived on Oct 31 to discuss food security in the wake of climate change with policy makers. It met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, ministers for environment and disaster management, parliamentarians, NGOs and civil society representatives during its trip. The UK's IDC delegation, comprising nine members from three parties of the British parliament, at a separate press conference Tuesday, pledged continued support for poverty alleviation and climate adaptation. During their five-day tour the IDC visited different programmes run by the UK's development arm DFID and also met the prime minister, cabinet members, development partners and representatives of civil society. Malcolm Bruce, chairman of the committee, said, "Bangladesh has a bright future as in the last few days we saw the people working hard to get rid of poverty and are progressing with their efforts despite different natural adversities." The committee members said they had agreed to assist developing countries after a recent discussion in Brussels and an important agreement will come out of the upcoming Copenhagen Conference in December. They said UK aid would continue to support Bangladesh in the next five years in the fields of poverty eradication and adaptation to climate change. Meanwhile, the visiting OIC chief on Tuesday praised Bangladesh's role on the international stage in highlighting the devastating prospect of climate change for vulnerable countries. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina on his arrival in Dhaka Tuesday morning on a three-day visit. The prime minister said Bangladesh had started working with its limited resources for climate change adaptation. She sought the OIC's assistance in this regard, the prime minister's deputy press secretary Mahbubul Haque Shakil told reporters after the meeting. The OIC chief lauded the role of Bangladesh in global forums in addressing the adverse impacts of climate change for vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. bdn
