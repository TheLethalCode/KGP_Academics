 KABUL, Nov 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it would temporarily evacuate hundreds of its international staff from Afghanistan due to deteriorating security, a sharp blow for Western efforts to stabilise the country. Spokesman Aleem Siddique said the United Nations would relocate about 600 of its roughly 1,100 international staff, with some being moved to safer sites within Afghanistan and the rest withdrawn from the country temporarily. The move, a week after five UN foreign staff were killed by militants in Kabul, is a blow for US president Barack Obama's counter-insurgency war strategy, which foresees an influx of civilian assistance alongside extra troops. Obama is due to decide within weeks whether to approve a request from his commander in Afghanistan for tens of thousands of additional troops. The US force in Afghanistan has already doubled in the nine months since Obama took office. The United Nations said its evacuation would not disrupt its operations in the country. "We remain committed to ensuring that all of our programmes and activities continue. But obviously following the events of last week, we really do need to have a look at how we can ensure that our staff can continue those programmes and activities, but at the same time we can protect their safety," Siddique said. "The United Nations has been in Afghanistan for half a century and we are not about to leave now. The Afghan people want us to stay." "ELIMINATE CORRUPTION" A U.N. statement said full details of the new measures would not be made public, adding: "It is expected that they will involve short-term relocations for some staff while additional security is being put in place." The United Nations mission played a critical role in organising elections in the country this year, and its agencies such as UNICEF run health, education and other programmes. In last week's attack, Taliban suicide bombers hiding explosive vests under police uniforms entered a guest-house used by U.N. staff, killing five foreigners and prompting a security review by many of the international agencies in the country. A second round of the presidential election, which was to be held on November 7, was cancelled after President Hamid Karzai's opponent withdrew, citing insufficient safeguards against fraud. Former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah's decision not to stand meant that Karzai was declared the winner, even though more than a quarter of Karzai's votes from the Aug. 20 first round were thrown out after a fraud investigation. The tainted election has hurt Karzai's standing among the Western nations with troops fighting in the country, making Obama's decision about whether to send more troops even more difficult. The chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, said on Wednesday Karzai's legitimacy among Afghans was "at best in question right now and, at worst, doesn't exist". Karzai needed to take "concrete steps to eliminate corruption" such as arresting and prosecuting corrupt officials, he said. There are now nearly 110,000 Western troops in Afghanistan, two-thirds of them Ameri
