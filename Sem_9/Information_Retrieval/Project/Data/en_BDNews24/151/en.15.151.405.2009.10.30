<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)--Winter vegetables have started coming to the kitchen markets in the capital and although the prices are a tad on the higher side, buyers are far from being turned off. Cauliflower, cabbage, English spinach, red spinach, tomatoes, beans, radish, carrot, water gourd, arum, gourd spinach and potatoes were seen neatly stacked up by the sellers. Atiar Hossain bought one kg tomato at Tk 75, a long water gourd at Tk 50 and a bunch of English spinach at Tk 10 from Hatirpool kitchen market. "I am paying a bit more because these vegetables are available only in this season and the season has just started," he said to bdnews24.com. The shopkeeper, Monwar Mia, nodded his agreement. Monwar is selling a bunch of red spinach at Tk 8 to 10, beans at Tk 80 to 100, radish at Tk 20 to 24, carrot at Tk 45 to 50, various arums at Tk 30 to 40 each, cauliflower at Tk 20 to 30 each, cabbage Tk 15 to 25 each and potato at Tk 40. He said the price will go down after a few days when the vegetables will start pouring into the market. On the other hand, the summer and rainy season vegetables are also becoming dear because their supply has gone down. Per kg jhinga, chichinga, dhundol, lady's fingers are being sold at Tk 38 to 42, Tk 5 to 7 more than the last week, said the sellers. Prices of several vegetables including aubergines, potatoes, onions and lentils are stable for the last 15 days, they said. But the price of loose and bottled edible oil has gone up, the sellers added. The price of per kg loose soyabean is Tk 85 and per kg palm oil is Tk 70, which were Tk 80 and 68 last week, said a shopkeeper from Sheorapara. Five-litre bottled soybean oil is being sold at Tk 425, which was Tk 400 last week, said shopkeepers.
