 Sylhet, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)  Around Tk 11,000 crore, roughly equal to ten percent of the national budget, is lying idle in banks in the Sylhet region, which could be invested in the industrial sector, says a study of International Finance Corporation. Despite holding all potential for being an export-oriented economic zone with good remittances, geographic position and natural resources, the region is lagging behind for lack proper investment policies, creating frustration among local businessmen. Around Tk 3,873.42 crore remittances flowed into the region through banking channels from Dec 2007 to Aug 2008. But most of it was spent buying plots of land and flats, building houses and for the families of expatriate Bangladeshis, said the study released on Saturday by IFC, the World Bank's lending arm,. Only 21 percent of the idle money was distributed as loans. "A special economic zone in Sylhet would create a big export market in the seven north-eastern states of India bringing a revolutionary change in the region," said Faruq Mahmud Chowdhury, administrator of Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industries. "We are trying for it for a long time," he said. Lack of cooperation from the banks, non-resident Bangladeshis' apathy for taking risks, high rate of interest, lack of proper knowledge for investment, insufficient electricity supply and bureaucratic tangles are some reasons that stood in the way of investment in the region, said the study. "Factories for producing cement, fertilizer, glass and power plants can be established by tapping the natural resources in the region," said Md Abdul Aziz, former chairman of Comilla Industrial Board. "Also, export-oriented factories for perfume, processed fruits, frozen fish, garments and tourism industries can be established," he said. Local businessmen said lack of proper infrastructure, complicacies in institutional financing and lack of administrative support are holding them back. Lack of proper statistics about the availability of local raw materials and absence of investment policies based on priority are other reasons for which there has been no industrial progress in the region, they said. "If our initiative succeeds, then non-resident Bangladeshis and industrialists will have privileges for investing here, developing business and industry," said Chowdhury. The research was led by Zakir Hossain, head of the statistics department of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology and dean of Agricultural and Mineral Science School. Fazle Elahi Md Faisal, assistant professor, business administration of SUST and Jasim Uddin Ahmed, former associate professor of Sylhet MC College conducted the research. The research focused on proper ulitisation of remittance money and how to develop production-oriented environment for investment in the Sylhet region. bdne
