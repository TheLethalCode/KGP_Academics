 HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters/bdnews24.com)--Asian stocks bounced back on Friday from their worst drop in two months after the United States pulled out of its worst slump since the Great Depression, which suggested that momentum of the global recovery is picking up. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.7 percent after a tumble of 2.4 percent on Thursday, the biggest since August when plunging Chinese shares hit markets across Asia. For October, the MSCI was up just half a percent as this year's 60 percent surge has petered out, partly as some investors have booked profits on the the big gains and fretted about historically steep valuations. But analysts and portfolio managers said Asian shares would remain in favour, even with occasional pull-backs, as investors prefer Asia's strong growth powered by China's economy. Data on Friday showed South Korean industrial output expanded at a faster-than-expected 5.4 percent in September and factories using the most capacity since June 2008 -- reinforcing expectations the Bank of Korea will start raising rates. Despite some mid-week selling, foreign investors also kept buying emerging market shares even while shedding stocks in the United States and Japan. Asia ex-Japan equity funds received $433 million in the week ending Wednesday, nearly a third of all the money going to emerging markets, according to EPFR Global. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients that Asia ex-Japan shares were enjoying conditions "ripe for further upside and global outperformance," citing earnings momentum, loose monetary policy and investors globally holding lots of cash. Commodities recovered along with stocks. Crude oil prices held near $80 a barrel and a one-year peak struck last week. But the Australian dollar, the major currency offering the highest yield, slipped as some market players booked profits on its 2 percent surge -- the biggest since June. Analysts said the 3.5 percent annualised growth in the United States during the third quarter, pulling the economy out of its worst recession since the Great Depression, pointed to further growth thanks to expected corporate inventory rebuilding and government spending. "The GDP number was supportive of a better economic growth environment. The higher-risk stocks are finding more support," said RBS Australia head of distribution Leigh Gardner. "The growth trajectory in North America and in Australia is supportive of markets going higher." Traders said the slide in shares and higher-yielding currencies the previous day was caused in part by hedge funds pulling out funds from winning bets this year as many in the United States are closing their books for the year next month. Japan's Nikkei average climbed 1.5 percent but shed 1 percent during the month. HOPES FOR QUICK REVIVAL The U.S. GDP figures helped relieve some investor worries that the global recovery was losing momentum, which had prompted some to take profits on this year's equity market surge as government stimulus and interventions helped revive growth more quickly than expected. South Korea's Samsung Electronics, a bellwether for Asian technology companies and the world's top maker of memory chips and LCD screens, reported its best-ever quarterly profit and forecast a strong 2010. Samsung's shares were up 0.7 percent, outpacing the 0.3 percent dip in Seoul's benchmark KOSPI index. Shares in Hong Kong were the strongest in Asia. The Hang Seng jumped 3 percent, with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) the biggest contributor as it gained 4.3 percent after a 19 percent rise in quarterly profit. Across the border in Shenzhen, Chinese investors flocked to the new start-up ChiNext market on its first day of trade. All 28 shares in the market more than doubled on their debut, a speculative surge that also suggested that upcoming share listings would meet strong demand. The dollar was steady after having lost ground the previous day on the hefty gains in higher-yielding currencies, while the yen pushed higher as Japanese investors sold higher-yielding currencies before month-end. The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket of six leading currencies, was flat at 75.919. The euro was also flat at $1.4830, while the dollar dipped 0.5 percent to 91.00 yen . The Aussie slipped 0.1 percent to $0.9150 and holding below a 14-month peak of $0.9330. Against the yen, the Aussie shed 0.7 percent. Government bonds in Japan and South Korea were little changed on the
