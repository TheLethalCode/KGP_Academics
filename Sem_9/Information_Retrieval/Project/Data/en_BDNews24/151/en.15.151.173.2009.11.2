 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina sniped at the opposition saying they cared little for the poor people during a parliamentary discussion on poverty reduction strategies on Sunday. Hasina termed the absence of the main opposition BNP 'unfortunate' and said, "They don't have the urge to do something good of poor people. So they did not join. "I'd be happy if they came. They should have participated the discussion on this national issue," she added in her remarks during the general discussion on the draft second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) in parliament on Sunday. Planning minister A K Khandaker tabled the draft PRSP-2 in the House on Sep 15 for the opinions of the MPs. Hasina spoke the draft for 38 minutes. Twenty-three MPs participated the four-hour discussion presided over by speaker Abdul Hamid. Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, finance minister AMA Muhith were also present in the discussion. In the beginning of the discussion, the planning minister informed the parliament that the paper would be finalised by December this year. He also asked for specific suggestions from the MPs. "We want to develop the country through the five-year plan. We've already formulated the PRSP and it's been discussed in parliament which is a rare instance," prime minister Hasina said. She said the PRSP will be uploaded on the Internet in Bangla. She touched on measures taken in the strategy paper on development through joint partnership, steps to fight Monga, generate employment for the flood-affected people, tap water resources for environmental development, ensure food security, develop poor-friendly infrastructure and the communication system. The prime minister cited her government's steps of rationing essential commodities for the garment workers, rescheduling school and office times to reduce traffic gridlock and constructing six flyovers and elevated roads in the capital. Power outages have been reduced, but her government still takes the blame due to mismanagement of the previous regimes, she added. Regarding climate change, she said, "The developed countries are to be blamed for this, not us. I presented this before the United Nations and demanded compensation. "We've taken plans to dredge the rivers and allotted Tk 700 crore for the people who may be affected." The prime minister also said about her government's plans to set up multi-purpose cyclone centres in the coastal areas. She asked the people to be alert to ongoing conspiracies and false propaganda against the government, which, she said, can cut poverty if the people cooperate with them. "I want people's assistance. Then I'll be able to build the country as a developed nation overcoming the barriers," Hasina said Referring to the recent bomb attack on AL MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, she said, "Conspiracies are taking place to plunge the country into chaos by carrying out terrorist acts. "But the people have confidence in us." "I would face any circumstances while working for the people's welfare," she asserted. bdnews24.com/
