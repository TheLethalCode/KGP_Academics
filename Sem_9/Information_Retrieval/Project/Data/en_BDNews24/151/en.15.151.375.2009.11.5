 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni told visiting British parliamentarians on Wednesday that her government intended to establish an international climate adaptation centre in Bangladesh, being on the frontline of global warming. The UK parliament's International Development Committee, comprising nine British MPs from three political parties and headed by Malcolm Bruce, met with the foreign minister at her office. Alongside climate change, they discussed democracy, development and human rights, and trade relations, said a statement of the foreign ministry.. Dipu Moni said her government had recently adopted the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategic Action Plan 2009, the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the Climate Change Multi Donor Trust Fund. Under the adaptation plan, Moni said, strategies have been formulated for managing disaster, adopting agricultural diversity, ensuring food security, dredging major rivers to sustain manageability, creating green belts and developing coastal forests. Bangladesh was also looking to a successful and fair outcome of COP15 in Copenhagen, she said. The foreign minister thanked the British government, the parliamentarians and the British people for their steadfast support for Bangladesh's return to democracy including its roadmaps to election, support for the voter ID card programme and election observation. She stressed more cooperation between the two countries on major international issues including UN peacekeeping, achieving Millennium Development Goals, and climate change. Bangladesh's idea to establish an international adaptation centre was initially presented at the UN's Bali climate change conference in 2008.
