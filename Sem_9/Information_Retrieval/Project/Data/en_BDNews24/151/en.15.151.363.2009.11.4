 TEHRAN, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian police clashed on Wednesday with supporters of Iran's opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi in the capital Tehran as the country marks the 30th anniversary of the storming of the US embassy. Thousands of Iranian security forces had assembled on the streets of Tehran to prevent any opposition gathering. "Police clashed with hundreds of protesters. They were chanting 'Death to dictators'.

Anti-Western rallies usually take place outside the old US embassy -- now called the "den of espionage" in Iran -- to mark the anniversary. Iranian militants stormed the embassy on November 4 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
