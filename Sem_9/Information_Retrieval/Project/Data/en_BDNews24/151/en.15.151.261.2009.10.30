 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona was "in a state of violent emotion" when he made lewd remarks at journalists after Argentina qualified for the World Cup finals, the Argentine Football Association's (AFA) lawyer said on Wednesday. FIFA opened an investigation into Maradona's outburst at the globally broadcast news conference after his team beat Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Oct 14 to secure their place at the 2010 finals in South Africa.
