<TITLE> Honduras' Zelaya set to return to power </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEGUCIGALPA, Oct 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Honduras' de facto government buckled under international pressure and agreed to allow the return to power of President Manuel Zelaya, who was toppled in a military coup four months ago. The breakthrough late on Thursday followed renewed pressure from senior US officials who traveled to Honduras this week for a last-ditch effort to end a crisis that had handed US President Barack Obama a foreign policy headache. "It is a triumph for Honduran democracy," the leftist Zelaya said after the rival sides agreed to a deal that should see him restored to office in the coming days. "We are satisfied. We are optimistic that my reinstatement is imminent," Zelaya said. Zelaya was toppled and sent into exile on June 28 but crept back into Honduras last month and has since been holed up in the Brazilian embassy, with Honduran troops surrounding the building. De facto leader Roberto Micheletti, who took over the country within hours of Zelaya's ouster, had repeatedly refused to agree to his return but finally backed down. "I have authorized my negotiating team to sign a deal that marks the beginning of the end of the country's political situation," Micheletti told reporters on Thursday night. He said Zelaya could return to office after a vote in Congress that would be authorized by the country's Supreme Court. The deal would require both sides to recognize the result of a November 29 presidential election and would transfer control of the army to the top electoral court. Micheletti said the deal would create a truth commission to investigate the events of the last few months, and would ask the foreign governments to reverse punitive measures like suspended aid and canceled visas. END OF ISOLATION The United States, the European Union and Latin American leaders had all insisted Zelaya be allowed to finish his term, which ends in January. They had threatened not to recognize the winner of the November election unless democracy was first restored. A US team led by Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon and Dan Restrepo, Washington's special assistant for Western Hemisphere affairs, sat in on talks earlier in the day and warned that time was running out to reach a deal. The coffee-producing Central American country has been diplomatically isolated since Zelaya was rousted at dawn by soldiers and flown to exile on a military plane. Zelaya had angered many in Honduras by becoming an ally of socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Critics also alleged he was seeking backing to extend presidential term limits, a claim he denies. Human rights groups have documented major abuses by the de facto government and say free and fair elections would be impossible after Micheletti curbed civil liberties and temporarily shut down pro-Zelaya news organizations. Obama cut some aid to Honduras after the coup but had been criticized by some Latin American for not doing more to force the de facto government to back down. The collapse of talks last week prompted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to dispatch the US delegation to push again for a negotiated settlem
