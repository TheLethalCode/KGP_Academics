 SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yahoo Inc, looking to match rivals in providing up-to-the-minute Internet search results, is running tests with several real-time search partners, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Among the companies providing real-time results to Yahoo on a trial basis is OneRiot, whose data will be available initially to about 10 percent of Yahoo's users, said a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak about the deal and asked for anonymity.

Under the terms of that deal, any data Microsoft's search engine has access to also would be accessible to Yahoo, Yahoo Chief Technology Officer Ari Balogh said last month. He said at the time that Yahoo had been testing the limited inclusion of Twitter messages within search results to certain users. Yahoo's deal with OneRiot, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, does not include any revenue sharing elements, according to the first source familiar with the matter. One Riot, based in Boulder, Colorado, collects real-time Internet information from various sources, including Twitter, Digg and its own network of 3 million users that use the company's software.
