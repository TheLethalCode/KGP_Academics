 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court has given the CID police another four days to question former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in connection with the Aug 21, 2004 grenade blast case. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui made the order on Wednesday rejecting the prayer for another 10 days' remand by investigation officer Abdul Kahhar Akand. The High Court will rule on Nov 11 the two petitions filed on Sunday seeking orders to be quizzed at jail gate and for proper medical treatment. The CID police remanded the BNP leader on Oct 29 in connection with the case after the Supreme Court put a seven-day halt on a High Court stay order regarding remanding Babar. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, serving 17 years on an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. b
