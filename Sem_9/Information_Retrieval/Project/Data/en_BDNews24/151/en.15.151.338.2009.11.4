Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association hosts the annual BATEXPO, to be inaugurated by prime minister Sheikh Hasina at Sonargaon Hotel in the morning "Exports have slipped due to the global recession. At the same time, prices went down. In this situation we are taking this fair with grave importance," BGMEA chief Abdus Salam Murshedi told a news conference on the eve of the fair, But, he continued, "The recession is fading gradually." "Demands for ready-made clothing will increase. BATEXPO is going to be targeting that reviving market." Murshedi said a larger number of foreign buyers would be participating this time, many of them already in the country. "The primary goal is to expand the ready-made clothing market in view of the fading recession," he said. According to BGMEA, 62 organisations are participating this year, from UK, US, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. There will be 86 stalls on show. There will also be the annual cultural night and fashion show as part of the BATEXPO tradition. The closing ceremony of the fair will be held on Friday night, even though the fair ends on Saturday. Khaleda Zia will be chief guest at the closing. The three-day KNITEXPO 2009, organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association ended on Wednesday. bdnews2
