 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)--The government has withdrawn an appeal against the bail order of prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the Tk 3 crore extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. The three-member Appellate Division bench headed by justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim on Thursday ordered cancellation of the petition seeking permission to file the appeal against the High Court order. The prosecution filed a petition seeking an order for cancellation. The High Court on Sept 16 granted bail to the prime minister in the extortion case. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, who represented the state, told reporters after the hearing the government had already decided to withdraw the case. Hasina's lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh said since the government had already withdrawn the case there was no need to appeal against the bail order. Chowdhury filed the case on June 13, 2007 during the caretaker government regime accusing Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of extorting about Tk 3 crore. Chowdhury later said he was under pressure to file the case. bdne
