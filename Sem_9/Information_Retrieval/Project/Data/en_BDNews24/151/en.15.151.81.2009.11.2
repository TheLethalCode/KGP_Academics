 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The wheels of investment are in motion again, says Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman. The central bank boss, in a burst of optimism Monday, said imports of capital machinery and raw materials are up as investors are regaining confidence after a period of stagnation. Reporters had asked the central bank boss whether, with a depression in industrial and service sectors, increasing loans to the agricultural sector alone could achieve GDP growth of 6 percent in the current fiscal year. Rahman replied, "The stagnancy in investment is fading." "Along with growth in the agricultural sector, positive signs are being observed in industrial and service sectors." "Imports of capital machinery and raw materials for industries are on the rise. Large syndication loans have also increased. Investors are regaining their confidence," said the governor. "The wheels of investment are again in motion" said the central bank chief. An IMF delegation, after an assessment of the Bangladesh economy, last week forecast GDP growth of not more than five percent. One of the reasons given was stagnant investment. The finance minister and Bangladesh Bank governor have both rejected the IMF forecast. Rahman said Monday it was possible surpass six percent growth this year with investment in all sectorsagriculture, industry and serviceand "prove the IMF prediction wrong". The governor was speaking after a deal signing between the central bank and National Credit and Commerce Bank for a refinancing scheme targeting environmental projects. The Tk 200 crore refinancing scheme for installing solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants was initiated in August. NCC Bank signed an agreement on Monday to become the first participating bank in the scheme. Rahman said he hoped the government would share climate change funds, from donor countries and agencies, with Bangladesh Bank to finance more adaptation projects
