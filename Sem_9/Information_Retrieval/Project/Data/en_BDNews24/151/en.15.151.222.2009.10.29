 Dhaka, Oct 29(bdnews24.com) - Security has been strengthened in and around the NBR headquarters and a regional office following threats by phone to "blow up" the buildings, police said. The threats came as tax offices were crowded on Thursday, with Saturday being the last day to file this year's income tax returns. Police said the threat came by phone around 5pm to NBR first secretary Serajul Islam. Income T Zone-8 deputy commissioner Ahktar Jahan also received a similar phone threat around 3.30 pm, police said. Officer in charge of Ramna police Shibli Noman told bdnews24.com that the callers introduced themselves respectively as a supporter of the Bangabandhu assassination trial convict Faruque Rahman and a supporter of Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Abdul Hannan. Both Faruque Rahman and Mufti Hannan are in jail. "The callers threatened to blow up the two NBR buildings," said Noman. He said NBR first secretary Serajul Islam was told: "Preparations are on to hang Col Faruque. Stop these. Otherwise the NBR building will be bombed." The OC said a similar threat by a "supporter of Mufti Hannan" was made to deputy commissioner Akhtar Jahan. Additional police were deployed in the two NBR offices immediately after the phone calls. Noman said, "Legal steps will be taken after investigating the matter." The government have already kept law-enforcing agencies on high alert around the country with the anticipation of tension in connection with Bangabandhu Assassination Case. bdnew
