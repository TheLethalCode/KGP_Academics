 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com)  The home minister told garment workers to "have patience" on Sunday, a day after violence at a Tongi apparel factory left three dead and scores injured. "Patience is needed from all to protect the garment industry amid a world recession," home minister Sahara Khatun said, addressing the BGMEA-hosted BATEXPO Garments Workers Fair. "It is not possible to solve your all problems overnight in this country with limited resources. So, it needs everyone's cooperation." "You also have to shoulder responsibility so that no unrest occurs in the apparel industries," she told workers at the fair. She expressed shock and sadness over the deaths in Tongi the day before. Workers of Nippon Garments at Ershad Nagar in Tongi, finding the factory shut without notice Saturday morning, began protesting. The clashes with police were sparked as their protests spread to the streets, blocking the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, where they began attacking cars. Three people died during the ensuing four hours of violent clashes between the police and garments workers. "I am really shocked at the deaths in Tongi," said the home minister on Sunday. "An inquiry committee has been formed to probe the incident. They will submit their report within 15 days." "Steps will be taken against those found to be guilty," she said. Police earlier Sunday filed a case, accusing some 2,000 of the protestors, including two of the dead. State minister for labour Munnujan Sufiya, local MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury and BGMEA leaders, among others, were present at the expo held in Birshrestha Shaheed Sipahi Mostofa Kamal Stadium. the fair. bd
