 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)--Senior Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta has sought to defend himself after prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament on Wednesday that he had not approved of Bangladesh's constitution in 1972. Suranjit explained that he refrained from signing it as the framers of the constitution only made primary education compulsory. "I wanted that the state should guarantee education up to class eight free and compulsory. But article 17 of the constitution only made compulsory education free up to primary level," Sengupta told parliament while defending his decision in 1972. "So, I did not sign it," he said. Sengupta, then the only opposition MP, was one of the members of the constituent assembly that prepared the constitution adopted on Nov 4, 1972. Hasina before the start of the prime minister's question-answer session said that Sengupta did not sign the documents of the constitution. Sengupta said now he was interested in approving of the constitution as Hasina's government has made education up to class eight free. "The High Court has given a verdict declaring unalwful the proclamation and order of the military rulers who amended the constitution illegally. "If the Supreme Court upholds that verdict, the country will go back to the original constitution of 1972. "I am waiting for the day to sign the constitution," he said. bdn
