<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)At least two people died and scores were injured as police and workers clashed at a Tongi garment factory Saturday. Authorities finally confirmed the deaths almost 12 hours after the deaths were first reported by the media Tongi police chief Tapan Chandra Shaha told bdnews24.com around 11pm that two bodies were recovered; van driver Babul Sheikh, 30 and mason Shafiqul Islam, 45. "They, of course, died in the clashes. But, neither appear to be workers of Nippon Garments factory." He would not give any further details, who the dead might be, from where the bodies had been recovered or how they died. "The cause of death will be revealed after post mortem," he said. Not long before this official confirmation, the home minister had said the government had received "no news" of any dead, while garment industry leaders rejected the death reports outright. According to witnesses, at least 100 people were injured during the violence, including police. Police were forced to fire teargas and rubber bullets, battling angry workers who said they found Nippon Garments factory at Ershad Nagar closed without notice in the morning with dues unpaid. Traffic on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway was blocked for over four hours from 9am as the demonstrations spilled out onto the streets and workers vandalised over a dozen vehicles, setting two of them alight. There were widespread reports on the ground early onfrom journalists, locals, bystanders as well as workersthat at least three people had been killed during the clashes. Despite multiple witness accounts, however, police would not confirm any deaths until almost midnight. 'No news' Media had been reporting between two and four people killed during the riots, including possibly a policewomen, from around midday. Seven hours later, home minister Sahara Khatun said that the government had not received any news of deaths. While authorities were slow to confirm the deaths, garment industry leaders rejected the reports outright. BGMEA said it had formed a probe body to investigate what happened, but claimed there were "no deaths", "no arrears due" and a "high chances of external influence behind the incident." The home minister, meanwhile, was speaking to reporters in the evening as she visited some of the injured at Rajarbag Police Line Hospital and Dhaka Medical College Hospital. At least fourteen of the injured were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Among them were workers as well as bystanders, said hospital officials. At least one injured police woman was admitted to RPLH. Emerging from DMCH, she said, "We did not get any news about any deaths yet. If we do, then we will let everyone know. If anyone is found dead, I will be deeply grieved and the home ministry will investigate the incident." "What happened in Tongi is very saddening. I have talked with BGMEA leaders. They have formed a probe. I have learned from them that no wages were unpaid. So it has to be investigated that what were reasons behind the owners of the factory calling a 'lay-off'." Pressed by reporters about the alleged deaths, home minister Sahara Kahtun said, "I am still not aware of any deaths. Some people were injured including police. I have visited injured police officers at the Rajarbag hospital. And I have seen other of the injured here." Answering another question on police fire during the incident, she said, "If police fired randomly, then steps will be taken to investigate that." 'At least three dead' Witnesses told bdnews24.com's Gazipur correspondent earlier in the day that at least one person was identified as he lay in front of the factory gates "after being hit by bullets" - it was not clear what type of bullets might have caused his death. They identified Babul was Babul Sheikh, 28, son of Anu Sheikh of Dinajpur and a van-puller whose wife Roksana was a worker at Nippon Garments. Locals said they lived at Block No 5 of Ershad Nagar and had two children. They said Babul was shot while searching for his wife during the clash. Witnesses said the body of another male, around 55 years old, was seen in front of the factory gate, but his identity was unknown. Others reported yet a third unidentified body. Many of the witnesses also said police had recovered the bodies and driven them away. Inspector General of Police Nur Mohammad, at the scene just after midday, said the factory was "laid off" the previous night, but police were not informed. He said police were unable to deploy patrols ahead of time to prevent the untoward situation. He did not confirm any deaths. Police still had not confirmed any of the deaths up to late night. 'Factory closed, dues unpaid' Locals said workers of Nippon Garments in Ershad Nagar were demonstrating at the factory from 8am over unpaid dues. Workers said they were owed three months' wages and told they would be paid on Saturday. But, they said, the factory owners hung a notice overnight announcing "closure due to economic depression" from Oct 31 to Nov 29. The workers were instructed to collect their pay on Nov 10. Finding the factory gate locked, the aggravated workers tried to break into the compound and started hurling bricks and stones at police who tried to stop them. Violent clashes broke out, including vandalism and arson by workers and teargas and rubber bullet fire from police, as the latter tried to stop the demonstrations spreading. At this time, a large number of people from nearby areas came and joined the workers, said witnesses. As a result, the violence spread further. The rioting abated a little after 11:30am as additional police and RAB were deployed on the spot, but sporadic clashes continued until 1pm, said witnesses. Local MP Zahid Ahsan Russel and Tongi municipality mayor Azmatullah went to the spot and spoke to workers at around 1pm. The workers said they found the factory closed that morning without any previous notice, which sparked their demonstration. Majeda Begum, a worker of the factory, told bdnews24.com, coming to work they had found that the gate was locked. "We were owed many arrears. As the workers wanted break the lock to enter the factory, police obstructed us." Another worker, Parveen, said the owners had been saying that they would close the factory. "But they have to pay our arrears before they close." BGMEA says 'no arrears', forms probe In an 'emergency press conference' at BGMEA Bhaban on Saturday evening, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Salam Murshedi, rejected the reports of deaths. "According to BGMEA's own investigation and information received from police authorities, no one had died in the Nippon Garments clash up to 5pm," said Murshedi. "Neither the government nor police have confirmed the rumours of deaths." He also claimed that no arrears were due to workers and that the entire incident was stage-managed. "Evidence had been found indicating high chances of external influence behind the incident." The BGMEA chief claimed, "People were brought from outside in an attempt to create chaos. Proper investigation will bring out the true story behind it." He said a five-member investigation committee has been formed by the BGMEA with a report to be submitted in 72 hours. Owner of Nippon Garments, Saiful Alam MP, also present at the press conference, was asked why the BGMEA or other authorities were not notified of the factory shutdown. He replied, "There is nothing in the labour law that an owner has to notify authorities of a decision to shut down." The ruling party MP said, "But the government has marked this side and other weak sides of the labour law and has formed a review committee to create a stronger version of the law for implementation. The committee is already working." He also allged "outside influences" led to Saturday's violence. "The government will take harsh steps against those responsible," he said. bdnews24.com/a
