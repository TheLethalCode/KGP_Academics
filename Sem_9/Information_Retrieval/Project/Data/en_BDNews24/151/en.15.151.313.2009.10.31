According to witnesses, at least 50 people were injured, including police. Locals also said two people, including a policewoman, were killed, but police could not confirm the news up to 2pm. Gazipur police superintendent Mahfuzul Haque Nuruzzaman had told bdnews24.com at around midday that two women constables were "missing" amid the clashes, but one of the policewomen was later located. Inspector General of Police Noor Mohammad, at the scene, said the factory was "laid off" the previous night, but police were not informed. He said police were unable to deploy patrols ahead of time to prevent the untoward situation. He could not confirm the reported deaths. Locals said workers of Nippon Garments in Ershad Nagar were demonstrating at the factory from 8am over unpaid dues. Witnesses said police tried to stop them as they were taking their protest to the street, which prompted the violence. Angry workers damaged and set fire to a number of vehicles, while police were forced to use tear gas shells and rubber bullets to bring the situation under control.

As the workers wanted break the lock to enter the factory, police obstructed us." Another worker, Parveen, said the owners had been saying that they would close the factory.
