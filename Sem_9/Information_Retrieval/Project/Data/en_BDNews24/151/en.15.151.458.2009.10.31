 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court has given police another four days to grill Kamrul Haq Swapan, the brother of self-confessed killer former army officer Shariful Haq Dalim, and Freedom Party worker Abdur Rahim, in connection with the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Saturday granted the remand after police appealed for seven more days to question them. Lt Col Dalim, who had confessed to the assassination of the nation's independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a military putsch on Aug 15, 1975, was convicted and given the death penalty. He is now a fugitive, while the long-stalled appeals of the other detained death convicts in the case are being heard in the Supreme Court. The two were produced before the court after the previous eight-day remand was over. Assistant commissioner of Detective Branch of police Akbar Hossain filed the remand appeal. Masud Ahmed Talukder, the defence counsel, opposed the remand appeal and prayed for their bail. "This is a casual remand appeal. Police are torturing my clients failing to nab the real criminals," he said. The court rejected his appeal, though. The remand appeal said police gleaned important information from the two detainees during the earlier remand and need to question them again for more information. Swapan and Rahim were arrested on Oct 22, one day after the bomb attack was carried on the ruling party MP and taken into eight-day remand the next day. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were also murdered on Aug 15, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Wednesday night. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. bdnew
