<TITLE> ANALYSIS: Defying powerful lobby, Obama kills pet defense project </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 by Arshad Mahmud Washington, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)The news didn't get much attention. It escaped the notice of many thinking folks, not to speak of ordinary Americans, as it was buried under the pile of more urgent, catastrophic news from Pakistan and Afghanistan on the day. Exactly a week ago, on Oct 28, President Obama signed the $680 billion Defense Bill, which contained a significant section that finally killed a darling of the American militarythe multi-billion dollar F-22 fighter jet project. Against strong opposition from the defense lobby and an entrenched vested interest group, Obama stood his ground and did away with a legacy of the cold war era. Independent military analysts called it a major victory for the Obama administration over the powerful defense lobby but at the same time they expressed skepticism over how long he would be able to resist their pressure. The scrapping of F-22, or Raptor, as the Pentagon calls it, offers a unique case study in how the system works in the United States or doesn't work because of the way it was built. The fighter jet was designed in the 1980s to fight midair dog fights with pilots from the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union disintegrated nearly 20 years ago and the fighter jet proved to be ineffective and hugely wasteful, the project continued in full swing largely because of the clout of the defense industry. Pentagon estimates show that it costs $356 million to produce a single F-22. And currently the Air Force has some 187 Raptors under its command. So you can easily calculate the huge amount of tax payers money that had gone into building these aircrafts, which proved to be a disaster afterward. According to Pentagon test results leaked to "The Washington Post" this year, for every hour that an F-22 is in flight, it requires more than 30 hours of maintenance. This perhaps explains why no F-22 has ever flown a mission in Iraq or in Afghanistan. Its armor is so light it can't withstand even small arms fire so it can't fight anywhere where it has to fly low. Yet, the project was not abandoned. From the beginning, the Air Force designed the plane to be politically bulletproof. They farmed out the subcontracts to build the Raptor to 44 different states so there would be jobs associated with building the plane in the jurisdiction of something like 88 different senators and a majority of members of the House. It was designed from the beginning to be, in one weapon designer's words, too big to fail as a government program. And the Pentagon comptroller from the mid-1990s admitted to the Congress this year that the Pentagon also knowingly lied about the expected cost of the F-22 from the very beginning. They told Congress it would cost much less than they knew it actually would. In the end, the F-22 became what a commentator described as "the mother of all spending disasters. Maybe not the mother, but at least one of the members of the family matriarchy". According to news reports, on average, the plane reportedly suffers a critical failure after every 1.7 hours in the air. The F-22 also has the handy feature of being technologically incapable of communicating with any other warplanes. So the pilots of an F-22 are completely isolated from any other U.S. aircraft in the skies. They can't hear them or talk to them. One consequence of the political trick of building parts for this thing in more than 40 states is that there are also huge quality control issues that become evident when you try to piece all those parts built all around the country together into one plane. Tear Spray, a weapons designer and longtime critic of the F-22, told MSNBC that even now, in 2009, parts that don't work are being retooled and refit individually by hand on the final assembly line as F-22s are being built. "The fact that they were built all over the country and that we had dumped so many of billions of dollars into them is a case study for how the country could end up spending billions upon billions of dollars for something everybody knew we didn't need", said Rachel Maddow, host of the MSNBC show, which reported the episode at length. The F-22 showed how you could design a system so that every decision-maker had a great locally driven reason to do something that was bad for the country. And then, something totally unexpected happened, emergence of saner political leadership. In the 2008 election, both major party candidates had the guts to defy those parochial interests and to be willing to say no to a fighter jet of all things. And they had the guts to say enough is enough to this zombie-spending suck that no one could justify but that just wouldn't die. Once President Obama was elected, Defense Secretary Bob Gates took the zombie on. " And with regard to something like the F-22, if we can't bring ourselves to make this tough but straightforward decision, where do we draw the line? And if not now, when? If we can't get this right, what on earth can we get right?" Gates asked publicly. He obviously had the support of influential senators from both Republican and Democratic parties. Sen. John McCain, Republican, and Sen. Carl Levin, the Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee, ended up co-sponsoring the bill to kill the zombie F-22. And of Course, President Obama had thrown his personal weight behind the bill. He threatened to veto the defense budget if it didn't kill the F-22.
