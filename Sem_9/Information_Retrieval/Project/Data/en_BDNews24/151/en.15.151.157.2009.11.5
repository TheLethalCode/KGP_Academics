 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Thursday passed the amended "Bangladesh Labour (amendment) Bill, 2009" providing for trade union bodies for labourers and employees of Chittagong and Mongla sea ports. The bill will also give opportunity to form a combined trade union body for users, berth operators and all labourers and employees at the two ports. It was tabled in parliament on Nov 1 to amend the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. State minister for labour and employment Monnujan Sufian proposed the passage of the bill and it was passed by voice vote amid boycott of the main opposition the BNP. It has proposed reducing the punishment for anyone who "willingly creates obstruction for the officials in charge of implementing labour laws". The amended bill suggests a maximum three months in jail for those infringing the implementation of the law. Bangladesh Labour Act-2006 had a maximum six-year jail term for a similar offence. The draft of the new bill got the cabinet nod on Oct 19. The previous BNP-led government, which left office on Oct 28, 2006, passed the weighty Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 on Oct10 that year amid walkout by the then main opposition Awami League. The bill having 354 sections was passed in just 15 minutes. Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, now shipping minister, was then a member of the parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment ministry. He had then placed a "note of dissent" at the time against passage of the bill.
