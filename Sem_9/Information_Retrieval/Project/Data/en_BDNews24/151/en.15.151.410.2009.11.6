<TITLE> American Muslims 'terrified' after US Army shooting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)--Moments after it was revealed that the lone gunman who went on a rampage at Forthood army base in Texas on Thursday killing 12 soldiers and wounding 31 others was a Muslim, shock and fear have gripped the Muslim community across America. Many American Muslims appeared terrified at the incident, expressing concern that it might trigger a backlash against them, although majority of them wholeheartedly condemned such heinous act as cowardly and senseless. A spokesman for Council non American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim advocacy group in the United States, called the mass shooting a cowardly act and demanded exemplary punishment for the perpetrator. "We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest terms possible and ask that the perpetrators be punished to the full extent of the law. "No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence. The attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all-volunteer army that protects our nation. "American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured." Although Americans are quite accustomed to such rampages, it nevertheless came as a total disbelief because of the fact that it was beyond their wildest imagination that such a horrific thing could happen on an army base in America. All the television channels interrupted their normal programming to broadcast the incident in special reports. President Obama, who was informed immediately afterward, called the incident "a horrific outburst of violence." "These are men and women who made the selfless and courageous decision" to risk their lives in the service of the nation, Obama said. "It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil." In a late night announcement, Lt. Gen Robert Cone, the Forthood base commander, said that the gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was in custody and hospitalised in stable condition, contradicting earlier reports from officials that he had been killed in what is believed to be the deadliest mass shooting on a U.S. military base. It is now certain that he would be facing serious questioning about what drove him to commit such an act. News reports suggest he was unhappy about his imminent deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Born and raised in Virginia, the son of immigrant parents from a small town near Jerusalem, he joined the Army right out of high school, against his parents' wishes. The Army, in turn, put him through college and then medical school, where he trained to be a psychiatrist. But the 39-year-old major reportedly started having second thoughts about his military career a few years ago after other soldiers harassed him for being a Muslim, he told relatives in Virginia. He had also more recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. Having counseled scores of returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder, first at Walter Read Army Medical Center in Washington and more recently at Fort Hood, he knew all too well the terrifying realities of war, his cousin, Nader Hasan, told the New York Times. "He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy," Hasan said. "He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there." Nader Hasan said his cousin never mentioned in recent phone calls to Virginia that he was going to be deployed, and he said the family was shocked when it heard the news on television Thursday afternoon. "He was doing everything he could to avoid that," Hasan said. "He wanted to do whatever he could within the rules to make sure he wouldn't go over." Several years ago, that included retaining a lawyer and making inquiries about whether he could get out of the Army before his contract was up, because of the harassment he had received as a Muslim. But Nader Hasan said the lawyer had told his cousin that even if he paid the Army back for his education, it would not allow him to leave before his commitment was up. "I think he gave up that fight and was just doing his time," Hasan said. Nader Hasan said his cousin's parents had both been American citizens who owned businesses, including restaurants and a store, in Virginia. He declined to confirm reports that they were Jordanian, but said the parents, who are both dead, had immigrated from a small town near Jerusalem many years ago. Records show that Major Hasan had received his undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech University and his medical degree at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Maryland. He did his residency at Walter Reed Medical Center and then worked there for several years before being transferred to the Darnell Army Medical Center at Fort Hood earlier this year. Major Hasan was not married and had two brothers, one living in Virginia and another in Jerusalem, his cousin said. The family, by and large, had prospered in the United States, with various members working in law, banking and medicine. The Associated Press quoted federal law enforcement officials saying Major Hasan had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that mentioned suicide bombings and other threats. But Nader Hasan, 40, a lawyer living in Northern Virginia, described his cousin as a respectful, hard-working man who had devoted himself to his parents and his career. He said his cousin had been a practicing Muslim who had become more devout after the deaths of his parents, in 1998 and 2001. But he said he had not expressed anti-American views or radical ideas. "His parents didn't want him to go into the military," Hasan said. "He said, 'No, I was born and raised here, I'm going to do my duty to the country.
