 Benapole, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)-- Benapole land port resumed operations on Tuesday afternoon after a halt of one and a half days in the face of resistance by Indian truck workers. A clash between Bangladeshi and Indian truck workers on Sunday evening over Indian trucks driving dangerously at high speeds in front of storage 22 led to the shutdown. The Indian workers barred truck movements from Monday. Jamal Hossain, joint secretary of Benapole C & F Agents Association, told bdnews24.com that a delegation headed by Shamsur Rahman, president of the association, went over to Petrapole land port in India on Tuesday and held talks with Indian officials. The Indian workers were assured of adequate security measures for their protection, after which they got back to work. Trade resumed at around 3:30pm. The two port authorities had earlier decided to start trade from Tuesday after discussions on Monday afternoon, but the Indian workers did not agree. Hundreds of trucks carrying perishable goods had been waiting on either side of the border . bdnew
