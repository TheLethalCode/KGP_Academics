 KABUL, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure grew on Afghan President Hamid Karzai's rival Abdullah Abdullah on Sunday to pull out of an election run-off as his supporters gathered to chart their next step in a protracted and complicated campaign. A deadline Abdullah had given Karzai to sack Afghanistan's top election official to avoid a repeat of the fraud-marred first round passed without action on Saturday. Western diplomats and media said overnight Abdullah was leaning towards pulling out. Afghanistan has been racked by weeks of political uncertainty since the flawed Aug. 20 first round was won by Karzai, with security also a major concern after a resurgent Taliban vowed to disrupt the Nov. 7 presidential run-off. With Afghanistan's political future hanging in the balance, US President Barack Obama is also weighing whether to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Obama met his top military leaders on Friday as part of a strategic review. With pressure growing on Abdullah to pull out, Western diplomats suggested it was no longer a question of whether he would pull out on Sunday but the manner in which he did it. "Abdullah has realised how painful a second round will be for the country. The issue for Abdullah now is how does he withdraw: by saving face gracefully or boycotting the run-off," one Western official in Kabul, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Analysts and diplomats believe withdrawing from the contest, perhaps as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a top government post in Karzai's next government, would spare the country further political pain and insurgent violence. Urging his supporters to boycott a vote that Karzai is expected to win, however, would likely continue the stalemate and offer the Taliban even more opportunities to exploit the lingering political uncertainty. While behind-the-scenes diplomatic moves to resolve the deadlock intensified over the past week, one Western diplomatic source said talks between Karzai and his former foreign minister Abdullah had broken down. However the source, who asked not to be identified, said talk of pulling out may be a negotiating ploy by Abdullah. "FAIRNESS" Abdullah's campaign team said he had talks with Kai Eide, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, on Saturday, as well as Afghan political leaders. "He has had no talks with Karzai," said Abdullah's spokesman Fazel Sancharaki. Malalai Esaqhzai, a lawmaker from the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar and a member of Abdullah's team, said they had been waiting to see if Karzai would bow to the demands made last week. "It's about the fairness of the process, this is Abdullah's biggest concern," said Omar Ghafourzai, another Abdullah adviser. There has been no comment from Karzai in recent days. Abdullah had been scheduled to go to India on Saturday for a seminar but cancelled the trip because of the crisis, heightening speculation he would pull out. Instead, he called a loya jirga, or grand assembly of elders, for 9.30 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Sunday. His campaign office said he would make a statement at a news conference after that meeting. Diplomats said there were questions over whether Abdullah would use his news conference as a concession speech to incumbent Karzai or declare a boycott of the run-off. Diplomats and analysts have said that under the constitution it was possible for the run-off to go ahead with Karzai as the only candidate. But they fear that would have a serious impact on the government's legitimacy. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Saturday any decision by Abdullah not to contest the run-off would not affect the vote's legitimacy. She told reporters in Jerusalem such a situation was not without precedent but that it was Abdullah's decision to make. The run-off was triggered when a UN-led investigation found widespread fraud, mainly in favour of Karzai, had been committed during the first rou
