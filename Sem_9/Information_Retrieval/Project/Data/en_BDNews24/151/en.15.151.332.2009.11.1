 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)--Authorities of Sir Salimullah Medial College have suspended 15 students tied to Bangladesh Chhatra League over their involvement with violence on the campus. The academic council made the decision on Sunday following a recommendation of the probe committee. One student has been banned for two years while the remaining 14 for one year. At least 20 were injured during a factional clash of Bangladesh Chhatra League on Oct 24. Principal M A Azhar told bdnews24.com: "Their studentship has been suspended, not cancelled. "They will not be able to attend classes or sit examinations, but will be allowed to stay in hostels. "After their suspension period is over they will join classes and exams regularly," Azhar said. The probe committee chief, prof A B M Maksudul Alam, submitted the report to the principal on Saturday. On the two cases filed with Kotwali Police Station, Azhar said the matter would be resolved after summoning the students. A three-member probe committee was formed following the clashes.
