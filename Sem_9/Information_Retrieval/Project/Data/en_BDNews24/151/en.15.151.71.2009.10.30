 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Adamjee Cantonment Public School (ACPS) students and their guardians on Friday staged a human chain protest in front of the National Press Club against the recent hikes in tuition fees. The students and guardians demanded that the school authorities meet their eight-point charter of demands. The demands include reducing tuition fees to equal tuition fees of other schools of similar standards, not increasing session fees, ceasing to charge development fees and donations during admission and resignation of vice principal and assistant teacher Abdus Salam. The other demands are raising classroom teaching standards and reducing compulsory coaching, improving school canteen food quality and education aids. Over a hundred ACPS students and guardians took part in the human chain formed at the initiative of the guardians' forum. The protesting students displayed placards, some of which read, 'We want tuition fees increase orders cancelled', 'Please save our children, Madam prime minister'. Mizanur Rahman, guardians' forum convenor, told bdnews24.com, "We have taken to the street as a last resort. The ACPS authorities have all on a sudden increased tuition fees by up to an exorbitant 120 percent." "As a result, the future of about 2,500 meritorious students of the school seems bleak and uncertain. We want an end to this suffocating situation through cancellation of the fees hike order." The leaders of the human chain included Mahtabuddin, Obaidullah, Abdul Hakim and Mahfuza Rahman. The ACPS authorities have increased monthly fees for students of classes II to X by Tk 700 to Tk 900, more than twice the fees before. b
