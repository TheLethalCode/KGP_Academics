<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5( bdnews24.com)A recent business survey hinted that trade and investment will shrug off lethargy at the end of year with one-third growth in the fourth quarter, a survey says. The survey, jointly conducted by Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund (BICF) and International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh, said the stalemate was there in the third quarter of the year as were in the previous two. The finds of quarterly survey, conducted from July to September on 778 establishments in the country, were presented at Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries auditorium in the city on Thursday. BICF investment policy officer Aminur Rahman presented the survey report titled 'The theme of BICF business survey 2009: reflection of views of businessmen'. The sense of lack of confidence among businessmen was being removed to some extent, the survey indicated. Commerce minister Faruq Khan, chief guest at the launch of the report, said the downturn in trade and commerce has started to recede. He said the business will improve at the end of the year. The information obtained from the survey would also influence policymaking, the minister added. Economics teacher Wahid Uddin Mahmud said, "The inertia in investment and other sectors of the economy are there for various reasons. Though foreign exchange reserves have increased, investment is not taking place." Mahmud thinks it is a good sign that businesspeople believe the sense of no-confidence will be over in the last quarter. South Asia chief of BICF-IFC advisory service James Cretel opined the survey will help the government in policy determination. He said, "Improvement in business climate will grow confidence in the field of investment." SME foundation president Aftab-ul Islam disagreed with the government move to close down Regulatory Reforms Commission and said time demands reform in trade and investment regulations. He also differed with the survey and said, "Growth will not happen in the way it has been projected in the survey, because the overall situation has not improved." Presided over by Mahmud, BIDS managing director Dr Mustafa K Mujeri, Age Garments Ltd chairman ASM Kashem, chairman of ICC Bangladesh standing committee of banking technique Mamun Rashid, Hossain Khaledi of the Anwar Group amd Bangladesh Policy Research Institute chairman Dr Zaidi Satter spoke at the programme. ICC Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman gave the welcome speech. bdnews
