 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court ended arguments hearing in Bangabandhu murder appeals on Sunday with a defence counsel concluding his deliberations. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam ended the 20th day hearing at 11:35am that began at around 9:45am. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun concluded his arguments on behalf of death convict retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Another defence counsel Khan Saifur Rahman was allowed to deliver his arguments. Mamun had earlier argued for another death convict appellant, retired Major Bazlul Huda. Next, Khan Saifur Rahman argued for two appellants--dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruq Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for death convict retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, concluded his arguments on Wednesday. The court had asked Mamun on Wednesday to make his presentation based on facts and testimony. As per rules, it is the prosecution's turn to present its statements after the defence is through with the same. On Oct 5, the freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences for hanging the accused to death in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
