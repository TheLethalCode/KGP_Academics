 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)The government has once again cut prices of non-urea fertilisers. The price of TSP has been slashed to Tk 22 from Tk 40 per kg, MOP to Tk 25 from Tk 35 and DAP to Tk 30 from Tk 40. The announcement came at a press conference Monday where agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury and industry minister Dilip Barua were present. Barua said the price at dealer-level would be TSP at 20 Tk, MOP at Tk 23 and DAP at Tk 28. The decision came as international prices have come down and to encourage farmers to use non-urea fertilizers, said the agriculture minister. "The current government is farmer-friendly; the prices have been slashed once again to protect farmers' interest," Matia told the press briefing at the ministry. But, Urea fertilizer would be sold at the old price, Tk 12 per kg, she added. The re-adjustment would result the government to spend an extra Tk 500 crore as subsidies which amounts to a total of Tk 3,500crore subsidy for fertilisers during the current fiscal. On Jan 14, the AL-led government, just after a week assuming office went for a massive prices cut of non-urea fertilisers. The government then halved the price of TSP from Tk 75-80 to Tk 40 per kg, MOP from Tk 69-70 to Tk 35 and DAP from Tk 87-90 to Tk 45. The total demand for fertiliser for the country stands at 4.2 million tons of which 2.95 million tons is for urea, according to figures from the agriculture ministry. b
