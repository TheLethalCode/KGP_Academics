 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will rule on Nov 11 on former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar's two petitions. The bench of justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mamnun Rahman on Tuesday heard the petitions filed on Sunday seeking orders to be quizzed at jail gate and for proper medical treatment. At Tuesday's hearing, TH Khan argued for Babar and attorney general Mahbubey Alam for the government . Mahbubuddin Khokan, lawyer for Babar, told bdnews24.com that the court was scheduled to judge the petitions on Tuesday, but it shifted the date. Mahbubey Alam said, "Babar's remand will end today (Tuesday). He was not tortured in the remand and nor will he be tortured later." The CID police remanded the BNP leader on Oct 29 in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade blast case. The Supreme Court on Thursday put a seven-day halt on a High Court stay order regarding remanding Babar. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, serving 17 years on an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. b
