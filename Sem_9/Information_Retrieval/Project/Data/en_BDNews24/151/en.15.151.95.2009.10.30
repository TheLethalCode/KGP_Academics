<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Pataka Michhil, a pro-Liberation War organisation, on Friday called upon the government to arrest and try the war criminals immediately. Pataka Michhil activists took out a procession carrying national flags in the morning from the Central Shaheed Minar, assembled in front of the High Court building and held a rally there. Sculptor Ferdousi Priyobhashini kicked off the procession. Motahar Akhand, Sheikh Md Ali Aman, Firoza Begum, Lovely Yasmeen, Sohrab Uddin, Sharif A Kafi, Pataka Michhil president Sheikh Abdur Razzak and others addressed the processionists. The government and its ministers have only been making announcements from time to time, signifying nothing, they said. They should put an end to such mockeries, the speakers demanded. They said they have taken to the street to see the war criminals put on trial. Pataka Michhil activists will raise a movement across the country, the speakers said. They had waited for long 38 years and now they would like to see their 'blood debts' repaid, they said. Pataka Michhil has announced that they will have a similar 'national flag procession' in November in Tangail which will be replicated all over gradually. The Awami League-led Grand Alliance's election commitments included holding trials of the war criminals. After the grand alliance assumed power in January, 2009, a proposal for holding trials of the war criminals was unanimously passed in parliament. The government amended the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973. Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Sector Commanders Forum and other pro-liberation organisations expressed their dissatisfaction over the procrastination of the government in implementing its resolve of holding the war crimes trial. b
