<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)A lawyer on Thursday moved the High Court seeking a halt on Biman's New York flights, recently trumpeted as resuming after over three years from Nov 24, saying that operating on this route will cause losses again. Barrister Masud Reza Sobhan of the Supreme Court filed the public interest petition, where the civil aviation secretary and chairman and managing director and Anticorruption Commission secretary have been made the respondents. The petition said Biman Bangladesh Airlines had faced huge loss for operating flights to New York, forcing the suspension in July 2006. The petitioner said he had learned from sources that Biman had counted Tk 60 lakh in losses for every flight. Sobhan sought the halt referring to media reports that said the operations will resume from Nov 24. It will leave the state-owned Biman under heaps of losses again, he contended. He appealed the court to issue a rule on Biman asking why resumption of Dhaka-New York flights would not be stopped. The lawyer himself will argue at the hearing. Last Tuesday, chief executive officer and managing director of Biman retired air commodore Muhammad Zakiul Islam told bdnews24.com, "We wanted to start flying to New York from November 24, once a week." "But considering the upcoming holidays of Eid-ul-Azha and Christmas, the launch of the flights might be delayed." But one of Biman's directors, talking to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity, after the board meeting, said, "The meeting discussed the matter and suggested taking necessary preparations to resume the New York flight in December." However, another top aviation official claimed, "We've finished our preparations. We can start as soon as the aircraft reaches us." Two new Boeing 777-200ERs, for operating long-haul routes, are scheduled to arrive soon, but officials could not say exactly when they would be available. Meanwhile, efforts were on to procure a Boeing-767 on a "short-term basis" for the crucial New York route, officials of the national flag carrier said. Islam, earlier on Oct 28, had said that the 777s were being delayed. "But the company will lease us a Boeing 767 for six weeks. We're going to resume the route with this one on a temporary basis." Biman signed a letter of intent with the Portugal-based Euro Atlantic at the end of September to procure two Boeing 777-200ERs on leaseone for flying to New York twice a week via Manchester and the other to European destinations. Captain (retd) Akram Ahmed Bir Uttam, a consultant for the civil aviation authority, told bdnews24.com that the number of flights could possibly be increased in future as it has always been a popular route. "Passengers to North America are so huge that one flight can be operated every day to three destinationsfour days to New York and the rest to Toronto and Los Angeles. "Another advantage for the passengers is they won't have to change planes en route to New York," Ahmed, also the vice president of Bangladesh Flying Club, added. Biman is now running flights on 24 routes with four DC-10, two Airbus-320 and two F-28 aircraft. The national flag carrier is also currently operating Hajj flights with three aircraft on rent to carry pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. bdnew
