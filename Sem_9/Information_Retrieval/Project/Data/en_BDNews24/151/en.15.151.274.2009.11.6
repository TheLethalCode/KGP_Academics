<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com) Private banks will soon be cleared to open agriculture or small and medium enterprise (SME) branches in rural areas, the central bank chief says. "Banks applying for opening agriculture or SME branches intended to revitalise the rural economy will be given approval on easy terms," Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said on Thursday. The Bank would even waive the requirement of advance demand, the governor said at an agreement signing ceremony between Prime Bank, Eastern Bank and Mutual Trust Bank. "But the branches will have to be outside district centres and in upazila or village areas. Bangladesh Bank will release a circular about this very soon," he added. Under the agreement, the three banks can take loans at five percent interest and invest them at 10 percent interest from the Tk 200 crore refinancing scheme initiated in August for installing solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants. Speaking on the occasion, the governor asked banks to go for schemes like agriculture loans or micro-financing by themselves rather than by other organisations, referring to NGOs. He emphasised the need of banks to consider the issue of ecology. "The banking sector will have to be developed into a model of 'green investment' through investing in installations of solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants." He also urged banks not to give loans for projects that harm the environment such as filling rivers, building illegal structures and polluting industries. The prior instructions given to private banks to open SME centres is not feasible, according to deputy governor Nazrul Huda. "This is why instead of SME centres, banks are going to be given approval for opening agriculture or SME branches," he explained. Under the new refinancing scheme, the central bank will give loans at five percent interest to banks, who in turn will add up to another five percent interest on loans to entrepreneurs for solar energy, bio-gas and effluent treatment plants. The central bank's green energy policy also states that up to 100 percent refinancing will be available for installing solar panels and solar voltaic connection plants in businesses and homes. The interest rates on loans in these three sectors will be no more than 10 percent under any circumstances. Banks are allowed to give loans of up to Tk 70,000 for installing solar panels in rural areas and Tk 1,75,000 in urban areas. The loan limit for establishing solar voltaic connection plants will depend on the wattage. According to the central bank's green energy policy, solar panels in urban areas may range from 170-520W and for rural areas, 10-130W. bd
