 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)--Amendments were brought to the constitution after 1975 through extra-constitutional means and should be amended again, the prime minister observed Wednesday. "I think there are many issues in this constitution, which should be amended and placed before the nation," Sheikh Hasina said at the start of her question-answer session in parliament on Wednesday, marked as the 'Constitution Day'. "The constitution has been tampered with many times. Those who illegally took power after '75 misused the constitution to validate their stay in office." At the onset of the session, speaker Abdul Hamid spoke on the 'Constitution Day'. A 34-member committee was formed on Apr 10, 1972 to formulate the constitution of Bangladesh. The committee presented its draft in the national assembly on Oct 12 after 74 meetings. The draft constitution was debated until Nov 3 from Oct 19. The constitution was adopted on Nov 4. "The constitution was adopted on this day in 1972 in Gonoparishad under the leadership of Bangabandhu. So, the day is the Constitution Day," Hamid said. "Many of those who were present on that day are no more now. Only a handful of them are now present in this parliament." Thanking the speaker for taking up the issue in parliament, the prime minister said, "I thank those, including you, who signed the constitution on that day. I am gratefully remembering those who are no more." The prime minister requested those who had signed the constitution adopted in 1972 to stand up by taking permission from the speaker. "You please stand up. Everybody wants to see you." Amir Hossain Amu, Abdul Latif Siddiqui and Enamul Haque Mostafa then stood up. The speaker said, "Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Emaj Uddin Pramanik, Dewan Farid Gazi and Suranjit Sengupta were also present at the time of signing the '72 constitution." Hasina said, "No, honourable speaker, Suranjit Sengupta was present. But he did not sign." "Tofail Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Emaj Uddin Pramanik and Dewan Farid Gazi signed the constitution." "After a revolution like liberation, people's hopes and aspirations were reflected in the first constitution." "We could stand stall as a nation in the 38 years (since independence) if the events on on Aug 15, 1975, jail killings on Nov 3 did not occur and the constitution was not violated time and again." Suranjit Sengupta sought to defend himself standing on a point of order after the Maghrib prayers. He explained that he refrained from signing it as the framers of the constitution only made primary education compulsory. "I wanted that the state should guarantee education up to class eight free and compulsory. But article 17 of the constitution only made compulsory education free up to primary level," Sengupta told parliament. "So, I did not sign it," he said. Sengupta, then the only opposition MP, was one of the members of the constituent assembly that prepared the constitution adopted on Nov 4, 1972. Hasina before the start of the prime minister's question-answer session said that Sengupta did not sign the documents of the constitution. Sengupta said now he was interested in approving of the constitution as Hasina's government has made education up to class eight free. "The High Court has given a verdict declaring unlawful the proclamation and order of the military rulers who amended the constitution illegally. "If the Supreme Court upholds that verdict, the country will go back to the original constitution of 1972. "I am waiting for the day to sign the constitution," he said. bdnews24.c
