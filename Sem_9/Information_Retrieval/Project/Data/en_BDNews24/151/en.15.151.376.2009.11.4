 Kushtia, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) - Kushtia Mahila Awami League general secretary Taslima Khan Akhi has been expelled from the party after she was arrested with arms, including an AK-47 assault rifle, and alleged to have links to an outlawed extremist outfit. A statement issued Tuesday by the Kushtia women's wing of the ruling party said Akhi was expelled for "violating party discipline and for links to criminal activities". The AL leader and three associates were arrested from a vehicle in on the outskirts of Kushtia town Monday night in possession of an AK-47, a shotgun and 82 rounds of ammunition. Police on Tuesday said all four were found to have links to an extremist group active in the southwest. Kushtia police super Shahabuddin Khan told reporters that Akhi and her associate Rani Khatun had been under suspicion of ties to Gono Mukti Fouz, an extremist left-leaning outfit banned by the government. "Our suspicions were proved after the two women were caught with sophisticated weapons. They were clandestinely supporting the banned organisation," said Khan. A police checkpost at Mangalbaria, on a tip off, had stopped a microbus heading towards Kushtia town at around 11pm Monday night. Police arrested Akhi, Khatun, another passenger Abdur Razzaque, and the microbus driver 'Shahin', on the spot after the arms were discovered in the vehicle. In the early hours of Tuesday police made a further arrest, Akkas Ali Mollah of Dangmarka village in Daulatpur upazila. Daulatpur police chief Hasan Hafizur Rahman said Akkas Ali also had close ties with the extremist group. A case was filed against all five on Tuesday under the Arms Act. Kushtia Sadar police chief AKM Faruque Hossain said Akhi gave misleading information. "She said she was forced to carry weapons." But Akkas reportedly told police that the arms recovered from the microbus had belonged to Gono Mukti Fouz leader Biplob Hossain, of Kalishankarpur, who was killed on Sept 13 in a shootout with law enforcers. Before his death, he reportedly kept the arms hidden in the ground near his house. Akkas was quoted by police as saying "in case of any danger, the arms were to be given to Kushtia Mahila Awami League leader Taslima Khan Akhi." Akhi has also previously been implicated in the murder of a local Jubo League leader, Jamirul Islam Jamu, police say. The decision to expel her on Tuesday came from an emergency meeting at the district Mahila Awami League office in Kushtia. Kushtia district Mahila Awami League general secretary told bdnews24.com: "The party image has been stained as she was caught with arms." "We have permanently expelled her from the party." Troubled southwest Law enforcers have expressed concern in recent months at the rise of extremist activities in the southwest, attempting a serious crack down in the region, Kushtia in particular. The drive has led to a spate of 'crossfire' killings. Allegations have also been rife of "influential" patrons of crime in the region. RAB and police have said drives are ongoing to discover "who are directly involved and who are behind extremist activities in the southwest". Those "indirectly backing these crimes in the region are being identified", RAB chief Hasan Mahmood Khandaker said in September. He also said law enforcing agencies were for banning more extremist organisations. bdnews
