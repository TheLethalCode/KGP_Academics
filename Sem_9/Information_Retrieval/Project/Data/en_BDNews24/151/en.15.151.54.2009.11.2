 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Monday amended electoral law to include the provision that political parties will lose registration if they fail to submit their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission by the Jan 25, 2010 deadline. The bill for a second amendment to the Representation of the People Order was endorsed by voice vote after law minister Shafique Ahmed tabled it. The law extends the deadline for more six months, but gives EC the authority to cancel registration. Independent MP Fazlul Azim placed a correction proposal to the bill to extend the deadline for another 18 months, in place of 12, adding that a major party still had not completed the registration process. He also protested the authority of the EC to cancel registration. In reply, the law minister said the proposed amendments have been introduced fairly to apply to all political parties. "EC's authority is not rigid, rather flexible. There are provisions for show-cause notice and a hearing before cancelling registration," he added. Azim's objection was rejected after voice vote. The law minister placed the bill in parliament on Oct 4, with the second amendment regarding cancellation of registration on failure to meet the new deadline. It amends Article 90 D of the RPO, where the fresh deadline for submission of permanent party constitutions has been extended to 12 months from 6 months with the new provision that registration will be nullified if the deadline is not met. Speaker Abdul Hamid referred the bill to the standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs for review for recommendations within two days. The main opposition BNP on Oct 12 protested the provision at the standing committee meeting. The watchdog rejected the objection. According to the 1972 Representation of the People Order (Second Amendment) Bill-2009, political parties must submit their permanent ratified constitutions within 12 months of the start of parliament. An earlier deadline had allowed six months ending on July 24 this year, as the ninth parliament went into its maiden session on Jan 25, 2009. A total of 39 political parties were registered with draft constitutions ahead of the December 2008 elections. Of them, 33 parties including ruling Awami League completed their registration process by submitting their final constitutions to the EC by July 24. The rest, including main opposition BNP, appealed to the EC for extension of the deadline citing their inability to hold party councils and ratify their constitutions within the stipulated time. The cabinet on Sep 14 endorsed the EC's recommendation to increase the deadline from six to 12 months. The statement comprising the purpose and reason of the bill says the provision of registration for the parties is made mandatory to join the parliamentary elections. The parties have registered to the EC with their provisional constitutions, approved by the top policy-makers, in line with Article 90 D of the RPO. But many of them could not submit their final constitution after conducting party councils due to some unavoidable reasons. Later, the parties appealed for extension to submit their ratified constitution. The EC then asked the ministry to amending the Article 90 D proposing a six-month extension and cancellation of registration. bdnews24.com/sm/su
