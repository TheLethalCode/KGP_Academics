<TITLE> Aug 15 killing was no mutiny: Haque </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)--The prosecution on Tuesday justified the trial of president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination under general law, saying no army rebellion had taken place on Aug 15, 1975. The defence counsels claimed that the gory event took place as part of a mutiny in the army. "Since there was no mutiny on Aug 15, 1975, holding the trial under normal law was in no way illegal," chief state counsel Anisul Haque told the Supreme Court. The case was filed almost two decades later because the governments before 1996 had shut the door on the trial. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam heard the arguments from the chief state counsel at the 22nd day's hearing. "If the trial was held under Army Act (1952) the convicts would not have the opportunity of extended trial and self defence," he said while presenting arguments on the point of army mutiny. The filing of the case 21 years after the grisly incident only goes to manifest the history of discrimination, negligence and lawlessness, Haque said. When the president's assistant press secretary-cum-personal assistant Mohitul Islam had gone to Lalbagh Police Station to press charges after the event, the duty officer had declined to take the case. "You will die and have us killed too. Go now. File the case when the situation will be favourable," Haque quoted the officer as telling Islam. Haque said the door for the trial of the killing was closed through clamping indemnity ordinance on Sept 26, 1975. "The convicts were sent to foreign missions with jobs in 1976. Convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Abdur Rashid tried to carry out mutiny in Bogra on return from abroad. "No action was taken against them. They were later sent abroad again," he said. "Syed Faruk Rahman was allowed to run for presidency by forming Freedom Party in 1982. It did not stop there. "Abdur Rashid was made the opposition chief by getting him elected from Comilla's Chandina constituency in the Feb 15, 1996 elections. Awami League and most other parties did not take part in the election on Feb 15, 1996. Four months later, the AL took office after 21 years, winning majority in a fresh general election. Faruk Rahman ran against military ruler H M Ershad in the presidential election. "The plaintiff himself also said he had not turned to Awami League for filing the case. He took three months to file the case after the Awami League government had come to power in 1996. "He had to understand whether the government wanted the trial of the killing and whether his life and property would be secure. "Faruk Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan were arrested on Aug 13, 1996. The plaintiff then understood that the situation was now favourable to file a case. "He explained the reason of delay in filing the case. The explanation is rational. He did not breach the law in getting late with filing the case. "There is no legal barrier in the delay of filing the case." Haque said: "The complainant said he had filed the case being driven by conscience. He did not accuse those he had not seen during the event. Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), questioned the signature of the three High Court judges in the ruling. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam replied that the three HC judges had put their signatures. Presenting a few examples of the High Court rulings, chief counsel Haque said there was no problem in filing cases late if there was a satisfactory explanation. He said terming that event was an army mutiny, the defence presented arguments in favour of holding the trial under Army Act. The defence claimed the trial should be cancelled since the trial was held under general law. The court asked Haque whether there was any army mutiny on Aug 15 and he replied in the negative. There is no definition of mutiny in the Army Act. According to the definition mentioned in the naval ordinance, the Aug 15 event cannot be considered a mutiny. "Under whichever act the trial is held, the punishment for killing is death sentence. "The law is not breached for holding the trial under general law. No mistake was made. Presenting many sections of the Army Act, Haque said: "It is mentioned clearly which crime is army mutiny and which is not. There is no provision of trial of killing under Army Act. "The general law says about the trial of killing." The court said: "The defence in their arguments said the trial will be held under the act the convict falls, not the victim." It asked: "Didn't the army say that there was a mutiny?" Citing an example of a case from Pakistan's Supreme Court, Haque said the court had sought opinion from the army headquarters on which act the trial would be held. "The court mentioned the names of each convict. The army headquarters did not drop any names. It did not say that there was any problem with holding the trial under general law." The court said: "The president was the commander-in-chief according to the constitution." Haque said: "The president holds the position constitutionally. "The mutiny did not take place on Aug 15. Moreover, it is not a matter to be considered in the case of holding trial. Haque told reporters after the hearing that the complainant Mohitul Islam could not file the case earlier since the situation was not favourable. He knew his life would be at risk if he had filed the case earlier, Haque said. "The Awami League government came to power in 1996. He did not file the case immediately since he did not have the idea about the government's stance. "He filed the case three months later after he realised that his life would not be at risk. "There is no example that justice cannot be sought after killing." If the trial was held under Army Act the defence would not get the opportunity of such extended trial and self defence. The defence would be affected if the trial was held under Army Act, he said. "Even if any army member is killed the trial can be held under both Army Act and general law. Haque finished presentations on the late filing of the case, one of the five points. He will present arguments on conspiracy on Wednesday. On Oct 5 the freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
