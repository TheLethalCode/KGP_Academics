Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas insists Israel freeze settlement activity under a 2003 "road map" for peace, a demand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected. Mitchell began his 10th mission as envoy to Israel and the Palestinian territories by attending a state memorial for former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated 14 years ago by a right-wing Jew opposed to his peace efforts.
