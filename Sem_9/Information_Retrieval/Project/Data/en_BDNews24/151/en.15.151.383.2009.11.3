 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)The government Tuesday tabled a bill in parliament for commercial handling of gas extracted from Bangladesh territory, including its offshore blocks. The new law, if passed, would allow commercial bodies to construct domestic pipelines in designated areas for transmission, distribution, supply and storage of gas subjected to licensing by the Energy Regulatory Commission. They would also have authority over the pipelines, the proposed law says. Mohammad Enamul Haque, state minister for energy and power, tabled the Bangladesh Gas Bill 2009, which was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on energy. The committee was given six weeks for scrutiny of the bill before its passage. "There is no law on commercial transmission, distribution, marketing, supply and storage of gas in the country," Haque told parliament in justification of the bill. The bill comes in the wake of contracts awarded by the government earlier this year to two foreign companiesUS-based ConocoPhillips and Irish firm Tullow Oilfor oil, gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. The contracts sparked controversy in the country as a left-leaning and very vocal action group, the National Committee on Protection of Gas, Oil, Electricity and Port, alleged that the deals would allow the foreign companies to export most of the gas out of the country. The government rejected the allegation saying there was no deal with the companies to export gas out of Bangladesh. According to the production sharing contract, the government would have first option to buy any extracted gas. The local market would have second option, and only if the domestic market cannot take the gas would the two foreign companies have the right to export it in the form of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). Much of the opposition to the PSC involved the fact that there was no facility in the domestic market for commercial handling of extracted gas. The newly proposed law could be a step towards establishing such facilities. The bill proposes allowing "any person or commercial entity to trade in gas, associated liquid hydrocarbons and derivatives by transmission, distribution and marketing subject to licensing". The licensed bodies would also be able to store the hydrocarbon, the bill says. "We feel the necessity of a bill like this with a view to facilitating transmission and storage of locally extracted gas," the minister said. "Besides, the bill will also help the government regulate sale of gas and establish rights on unmeasured gas resources." The bill also proposes up to one year imprisonment or Tk 100,000 penalty for those who cheat consumers by selling CNG in violation of the government fixed gas pressure or by tampering with gauges. For "acts of sabotage" in the gas industry in any form, the bill also stipulates a maximum five years in jail and a Tk 1 million penalty for those involved destructive activities. bdn
