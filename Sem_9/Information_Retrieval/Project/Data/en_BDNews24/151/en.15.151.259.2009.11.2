 by Arshad Mahmud Washington, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Three days after federal agents shot and killed a Muslim religious leader in Michigan, American-Muslims across the country are asking whether the victim was indeed an extremist as the FBI has portrayed him, or whether the agents used heavy-handed tactics against an upright and vocal Islamic scholar to silence his voice. The fatal shooting Wednesday of Luqman Ameen Abdullah, the 53-year-old Imam of Masjid Al Haqq in Dearborn, Michigan, has produced such deep shock and anger that law enforcement officials said they were concerned about retaliation in the wake of his death. "My father was a sharp-tongued individual," Omar Regan said of his father. "He would talk about his dislike of the government, about how law enforcement wasn't protecting and serving the people. But speaking his emotions and acting on his emotions are two different things", Regan, a comedian and motivational speaker, said at his father's funeral on Saturday in Dearborn, who flew in from Los Angeles. According to news reports, his sentiments were echoed by many Muslims in Dearborn, a city with large Muslim population, and across the country. Federal agents described Luqman as a separatist Muslim intent on overthrowing the United States Government, but he was not accused of terrorism. When reporters asked why Abdullah had not been charged with terrorism, the United States attorney in Michigan, Terrence Berg, said, "The charges speak for themselves." Abdullah died in a shootout in the raid of a warehouse just outside the city, in Dearborn, where he stored goods. The raid was one of three in which federal agents said were intended to arrest Abdullah and 10 other men on charges that included conspiracy to sell stolen goods, mail fraud and illegal possession of firearms. But the authorities said Abdullah, who had a lengthy criminal record and was forbidden to have a firearm, opened fire on the agents. "I'm comfortable with what our agents did," said Andrew G. Arena, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the F.B.I. "They did what they had to do to protect themselves." Two of the 11 defendants remain at large; one, Mujahid Carswell, 30, another son of Abdullah, was arrested Thursday in Canada. (Law enforcement officials said Abdullah's shots killed an F.B.I. dog, Freddy, who is to be honoured for dying in the line of duty). A 43-page criminal complaint described Abdullah as the belligerent leader of a faction of a group called the Ummah, meaning "the Brotherhood," which advocates the establishment of a separate nation governed by Islamic laws within the United States. The authorities had been monitoring him for years. But friends and acquaintances of Abdullah disputed the authorities' version. "They knew a long time ago that this was a penny ante operation, and they could have stopped it," Abdullah El-Amin, an imam at the Muslim Center, Detroit's largest black mosque, said of federal authorities. "It didn't have to get to this point, people getting killed." El-Amin told the New York Times that he had known Abdullah for more than 20 years, although they had never attended the same mosque. "The very incendiary rhetoric that the F.B.I. alleges, I never heard that from him," said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "There was nothing extraordinary about him." The Muslim Public Affairs Council, a policy and advocacy group based in Los Angeles, is calling for an investigation of Abdullah's killing, which it describes as "deeply disturbing." But Eide A. Alawan, director of the office of interfaith outreach at the Islamic Center of America, one of the largest Muslim centers in the Midwest, in Dearborn, took a critical view of Abdullah and his defenders. "This is not the first time in history that someone has used a religion to do some harm in the name of faith," Alawan said. "Now is an opportune time for some to show their militancy. It gets attention. But it's no different than the Ku Klux Klan in the 40s and 50s using the cross." The Muslim Alliance in North America, a national network based in Kentucky, expressed shock at the killing of Abdullah, who served on its governing body. "Reference to the Ummah as a 'nationwide radical fundamentalist Sunni group consisting primarily of African-Americans' is an offensive mischaracterization," the group said in a statement. "To those who have worked with Imam Luqman A. Abdullah," it continued, "allegations of illegal activity, resisting arrest, and 'offensive jihad against the American government' are shocking and inconsistent. In his ministry he consistently advocated for the downtrodden and always spoke about the importance of connecting with the needs of the poor."
