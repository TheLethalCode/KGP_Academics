<TITLE> Tendulkar should play fewer ODIs - Border </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdness24.com)  Former Australian captain Allan Border has said Sachin Tendulkar should play fewer ODIs to prolong his Test career, reports Cricinfo. Tendulkar, who is a few weeks away from completing 20 years as an India player, is one of the senior-most players on the international circuit. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya is the only other current international who began his career in the 1980s. Tendulkar has played 432 ODIs - second behind Jayasuriya's 441 - and 159 Tests since 1989. Over the last couple of years, he opted out of Twenty20 internationals to focus on the game's longer formats. He has, however, participated in both seasons of the IPL, as captain of the Mumbai Indians franchise. "I have high esteem for Tendulkar and his achievements in international cricket," Border told PTI. "But I think it would be better for him to appear in fewer limited-over matches, including one-dayers. It would help him to prolong his Test career." Border said it was a remarkable feat for anyone to sustain a 20-year career with injuries on the rise. Tendulkar's career has been plagued by injuries, the most notable being his troublesome tennis elbow. Recently, he had to miss the four-match ODI series in the West Indies due to a finger injury he picked up during the IPL. "Representing your country for 20 years in international arena is not a small achievement," Border said. "There is always a lot of pressure on an international cricketer and I must say he (Tendulkar) has managed it beautifully. Like many others, his career was also disturbed by injuries. But even after many ups and downs, Tendulkar still has the same passion and love for the game." Border himself lasted 16 years as an international player before retiring in 1994. His 156 Test appearances was a world record before Steve Waugh overtook
