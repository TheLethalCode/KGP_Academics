 ISLAMABAD, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/euters) - Gunmen on a motorcycle wounded a Pakistani army brigadier and his driver on Friday in the third drive-by attack on military men in the capital since the army launched an offensive against militants in mid-October. The army went on the offensive in South Waziristan, a lawless ethnic Pashtun region on the Afghan border on October 17, aiming to root out Pakistani Taliban militants behind a wave of violence in urban areas. Police declined to comment on the identity of the two men wounded on Friday but a military official said one of the men was a brigadier and the other his driver. "Both of them are safe," said the military official who declined to be identified. Dawn television said the brigadier worked for a military intelligence agency. A brigadier and his driver were killed in a similar shooting on October 22. Days later gunmen opened fire at a military vehicle but the occupants escaped unharmed.
