 Tongi, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Police and garment workers clashed violently at Ershad Nagar in Tongi on Saturday, with two deaths being reported but unconfirmed. Traffic on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway was halted since 9am as the violence spilled onto the streets. According to witnesses, some 50 people including police were injured. Locals also said two people, including a policewoman, were killed, but police could not confirm the news up to midday. Meanwhile, Gazipur police super Mahfuzul Haque Nuruzzaman told bdnews24.com that two women constables could not be located. Locals said workers of Nippon Garments were demonstrating at the factory from 8am over unpaid dues. Police obstructed them while as they were taking their protest to the street, which prompted the violence. Angry workers damaged and set fire to a number of vehicles, while police were forced to fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. The situation became calmer a little after 11:30am as additional police and RAB were deployed on the spot, but sporadic clashes continued, said witnesses. bdnews
