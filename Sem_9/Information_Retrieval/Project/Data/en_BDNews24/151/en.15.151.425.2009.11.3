<TITLE> Stop backing killers: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina renewed her assault on the opposition on Monday, telling them to stop supporting "bomb attackers and killers". "I urge the opposition parties to refrain from such heinous activities," Hasina said in parliament as MPs discussed a censure motion on the Oct 21 bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. The prime minister said, on the day when the court first pronounced verdict of the Bangabandhu murder case, during her previous 1996-2001 tenure, the then opposition BNP called a general strike. "They called the hartal so that the court could not deliver the verdict against the killers." "One of their main motives is to protect and patronise the killers," said Hasina. She said, after the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, the then BNP government stated that Hasina herself had carried the grenade in her bag. "I ask you, when was I a grenade expert?" she said. Hasina said her government would root out those responsible for the attack on Taposh, at any cost, to hand them exemplary punishment. Taposh's parents were killed alongside Hasina's father and the country's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. Taposh is also Hasina's nephew. Hasina said the Leader of the Opposition (Khaleda Zia) could have condemned the attack on Taposh, "an orphan". "Why is she so shy of condemning the attack?" questioned the prime minister. She termed the attackers "beasts" and said, "The whole nation will show hatred for them." "I support this censure motion and urge the House to adopt the same". Parliament unanimously adopted a censure motion against the attack on Taposh, though the opposition was absent. The main opposition BNP has been abstaining from parliament for most of the year, due to a seating dispute and what they term "a hostile environment" created by the ruling party. Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta moved the censure motion on Monday; 26 MPs took part in the discussion which ran for 2 hours and 52 minutes. Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim said the BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman was involved in Bangabandhu's killing. "Didn't Ziaur Rahman proclaim the indemnity ordinance to save the killers and himself? "Didn't he appoint the killers of Bangabandhu as ambassadors in foreign missions?" said Selim, who is Sheikh Mujib's nephew, Hasina's cousin and Taposh's uncle. He said the involvement of Ziaur Rahman in the killing of Bangabandhu "would be clearer in the days to come". Selim said the people of Bangladesh would resist any future move "to overthrow an elected government by military dictators". Suranjit Sengupta termed the attack on Taposh as an attack on the country's democracy and constitutionality. bdn
