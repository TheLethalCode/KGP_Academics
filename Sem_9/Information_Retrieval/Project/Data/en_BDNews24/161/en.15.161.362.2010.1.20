<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh faced an uphill task to save the first Test against India as they finished on 67-2 the fourth day at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Wednesday. The Tigers still trail by 348 runs with eight wickets in hand. Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Ashraful will start the fifth and final day on 23 and 16 respectively. Bangladesh needed a start but they lost Imrul Kayes with only eight runs on the board and Shahriar Nafees (21) before close of play. Kayes was out for one to a peach of a delivery from Zaheer that drew the batsman forward and took the outside edge for an easy catch. Nafees started aggressively before Ishant Sharma dismissed him just like in the first innings slashing outside only to be caught in the gully. He added 39 runs for the second wicket. Earlier, India declared their second innings on 413-8 thanks to Gautam Gambhir's ninth Test century, and half-centuries from VVS Laxman (69 not out) and nightwatchman Amit Mishra (50). The opening batsman, who made 116, entered the record books on becoming the first Indian player to make five consecutive Test hundreds. He joined an exclusive club of four batsmen led by late Sir Donald Bradman with six. Despite losing first-innings centurion Sachin Tendulkar cheaply after lunch, India who began the fourth day 45 minutes ahead of schedule on 122-1 with Gambhir on 47 and Mishra on 24 took charge of proceedings raced to 66 runs in the first hour before Mishra fell having completed a maiden Test half-century. Gambhir went after the opener made 116 off 129 balls with 10 fours and a six. It was his ninth Test century and second against the Tigers in Chittagong. He added 45 quick runs for the third wicket with Rahul Dravid before becoming Shafiul Islam's first Test wicket. Dravid had another dismal time at the crease before being run out for 24 before his side went to lunch on 259-4. Fast bowler Rubel Hossain grabbed the prized wicket of Tendulkar (16), who uncharacteristically played across the line with the score on 272. The tourists then lost two more wickets just before tea -- Yuvraj Singh who added 41 runs for the sixth wicket and Dinesh Karthik to give the Tigers hope of keeping their opponents below 400 runs. But VVS Laxman and Zaheer Khan ensured India were on course for a target of in excess of 400 runs with 32 runs for the eighth wicket before Zaheer was dismissed for an entertaining 20 off 17 balls. Zaheer was particularly severe on new cap Shafiul Islam in the last over before tea when he slammed 14 runs. Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah both bagged two wickets each. Bangladesh made 242 in their first innings in reply to the tourists'
