<TITLE> Dhaka wants 'ad-hoc' Teesta deal: FM </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh wants an early "ad hoc" deal with India on the share of the Teesta waters after a JRC meeting slated for March, the foreign minister said on Wednesday. She also stressed basin-wise management of common rivers to tap the potentials of hydroelectricity in the South Asian countries. "The government wants to sign an ad hoc deal with India after the ministerial meeting of the Joint River Commission in March," Dipu Moni told a roundtable on the prime minister's recent India visit. "We cannot wait for getting (Teesta's) hydrological data available after a joint survey," said the minister in her address as chief guest. English newspaper The Independent and the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies co-organised the discussion at BEL Tower in Dhanmondi. Bangladesh and India in the joint communiqu on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit said they would expedite the negotiation on the Teesta water-sharing to reach an agreement. It also mentions that the ministerial level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission will take place in March this year to finalise a deal. The two countries in a joint statement on Dipu Moni's India visit in September last year agreed to form a joint technical team to carry hydrological survey on the Teesta. The data generated in the hydrological survey will be used for sharing the waters. The secretary-level and technical experts-level meetings of the JRC had already taken place and they "narrowed down" their difference on sharing the waters. The country's largest irrigation project, covering an area of 750,000 hectares of land, depends on the Teesta, a common river originating from India. India diverts water in the upstream with a barrage in Gazoldoba. Every year, during the dry season, the Teesta faces a water crunch, leaving Bangladesh's major rice-producing region of Rangpur dry. Bangladesh says it cannot go ahead with the second phase of the Teesta irrigation project due to annual water shortages in the river. "We should not only discuss the sharing of the waters of the 54 common rivers (with India), but also basin-wise management of the trans-boundary rivers to utilise the potentials of hydroelectricity in the region," Moni said. "We have to work with all countries in the region," said the foreign minister, "We are talking about regional grid connectivity. So, regional approach is necessary for this." A lower riparian country, Bangladesh has the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna basins, with the rivers running through India, China, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. All the three big rivers come down to Bangladesh from India. Of the total 54 common rivers, Bangladesh and India could agree sharing waters of only the Ganges. According to studies, mountainous Bhutan alone has the potential to produce 28,000 mega watts of hydroelectricity. Experts have been suggesting basin-wise management of the rivers with regional approach, but the countries are yet to reach agreement on this issue. The foreign minister criticised the BNP-led government for simply doing nothing to resolve the water-related disputes with India.
