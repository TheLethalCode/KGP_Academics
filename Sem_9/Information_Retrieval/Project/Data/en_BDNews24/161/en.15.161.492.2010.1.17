 MELBOURNE, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number three Novak Djokovic believes Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal's stranglehold on men's tennis is slowly loosening. The Serb said Sunday the rise in genuine contenders capable of breaking the Grand Slam dominance of Federer and Nadal gave a boost to the sport. "I think it's getting very interesting, men's tennis," Djokovic told reporters at Melbourne Park on the eve of the year's first Slam at the Australian Open. "It's good for the sport to have a good group of the players able to win a major event or a Grand Slam," added Djokovic, one of only two players other than Federer and Nadal to win a Grand Slam title in the past 19 majors when he won the 2008 Australian Open.

"I think I improved on my net play and my physical ability, (and) strength. I've put some variety in the game, some volleys and serve, I've changed some things," he said. "I might not play as well as I did in 2008 from the baseline, but I still have a lot of belief that I have a great game.
