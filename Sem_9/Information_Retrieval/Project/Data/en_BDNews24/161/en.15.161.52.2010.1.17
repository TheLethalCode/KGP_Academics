 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will hold a press conference at 3:30pm on Sunday on the outcome of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to India. The homework has been done to hold the briefing at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office, her press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com. The briefing was postponed by one day because the prime minister was scheduled to meet the press on the same day on Saturday. Hasina and her ruling Awami League claimed her state visit to India was a total success, but opposition BNP termed it a total failure. At Sunday's briefing Khaleda is expected to spell out her party's position about Hasina's trip to India and on the deals and MoUs signed in New Delhi since the opposition BNP has been boycotting parliament for a long period. The prime minister at her Saturday's press conference urged the opposition to return to parliament and place their criticisms in the House. During the visit, the two sides signed three dealsan accord on combating crime and MoUs on power sector cooperation and cultural exchange. Some progress were also made on connectivity, including corridors for Bangladesh to Bhutan and Nepal, use of Mongla and Chittagoing ports by India and joint rail and other infrastructure projects with major Indian assistance. BNP and its allies have said India would benefit most from all these deals. But the PM at her Saturday's press conference claimed that she had secured Bangladesh's interests and achieved the objectives of her mission to India. b
