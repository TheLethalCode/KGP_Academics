 Chittagong, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  India were 209-8 with an hour's play left on the first day of the Idea Cup first Test against Bangladesh at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium here on Sunday. The tourists, who resumed after tea on 160-6, fell into further strife when Amit Mishra and Zaheer Khan departed. Mishra was trapped lbw by Shahadat Hossain for 14 after adding 32 runs with Sachin Tendulkar while Zaheer, who was dropped on 6, was caught point off Shakib with the score on 209. Both Shakib and Shahadat have four wickets each. Tendulkar, who after lunch added another feature to his illustrious career by completing 13,000 runs in the longer-version, was batting on 73. Put into bat, India began after lunch on 63-0, but lost six wickets for 97 runs. The world number one Test-ranked side lost their first wicket on 79 when acting captain Virender Sehwag (52 off 51 balls) was caught by Tamim Iqbal off Shakib Al Hasan. His half-century (off 45 balls) was the quickest by an Indian batsman against the Tigers. Sehwag hammered nine fours in his almost run-a-ball knock. On the same score his opening partner Gautam Gambhir (23 off 44 balls) was caught behind off Shahadat Hossain while chasing an innocuous delivery. But the loudest cheers were reserved for 'The Wall' Rahul Dravid who was yorked by Shahadat Hossain six runs later playing down the wrong line. The home side then added three more scalps with the wickets of VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik. Laxman who was stumped for seven off the bowling of Shakib after adding 22 runs with Tendulkar. The same bowler also accounted for Yuvraj who failed to put away a full toss after putting on 42 runs for the fifth wicket. One run later Karthik was caught in the gully off Shahadat who was brought on as a bowling change. Dense fog meant morning's play was delayed by 90 minutes after Bangladesh won the toss and opted to field. The home side included pacer Shahadat Hossain and former IPL rebel Shahriar Nafees while Shafiul Islam was making his debut in a three-man seam attack.
