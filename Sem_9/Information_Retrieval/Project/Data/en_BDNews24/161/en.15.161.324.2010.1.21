<TITLE> HC 'cannot revoke 5th Amendment' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)TH Khan, lawyer for BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, said the High Court has no authority to revoke any law, during a hearing Thursday on the repeal of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Barrister Moudud Ahmed, another of Delwar's lawyers, said the High Court went "too far" in 2005 in declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal. A full six-member bench of the Appellate Division, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, was hearing two separate petitions by Delwar and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyersMunshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyanseeking a stay on the High Court judgment. "It is only parliament that can revoke a law," Khan told the court. He referred to articles 101 and 102 of the constitution on the authority of the judges. He said the Awami League government in 1996 had revoked an indemnity ordinanceto allow trial for the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahmanby constitutional means, not through the court. "The court cannot declare the Fifth Amendment illegal, only parliament can do it," he said. The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Marshal Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared regimes between Aug 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman illegal. The original petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalised all the regimes between 1975 and 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power -- military or otherwise -- after the assassination of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. In 2005, an alliance government led by BNP, which was floated with the backing of General Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling. But the current Awami League-led government petitioned the High Court and was permitted to withdraw the leave to appeal earlier this month, allowing the stay also to be lifted and the judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal to stand. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had told the media at the time that with the withdrawal of the leaves to appeal and vacation of the existing stay order, the High Court ruling was upheld, for now, despite the two pending petitions. 'HC JUDGMENT WENT TOO FAR' Barrister Moudud Ahmed, another of Delwar's lawyers, told the court on Thursday: "The original petition was filed regarding only the ownership of Moon Cinema Hall. But the High Court gave a ruling totally canceling the Fifth Amendment, which was more than expected." He also said: "The running of the state was maintained through the Fifth Amendment the same way Marshal Law was given legal validity through the Seventh Amendment. "The takeover of Justice Sahabuddin Ahmed was given validity through the Eleventh Amendment," he also cited. "All the amendments were made for the similar purpose." "So the Fifth Amendment is also legal. There is no scope to judge it illegal," Moudud Ahmed said. The Appellate Division bench set the next hearing date on the petitions for Jan 24. b
