 Sikander Ali Staff Correspondent Chittagong, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan boldly said his team was looking to win the first Test after the fourth day's play on Wednesday. "We will go for a win. If we can bat all day long we will win the Test." Bangladesh were 67-2 in their second innings at stumps. They trail by 348 runs. Shakib explained "The wicket is good for batting though the spinners are getting some assistance. I think after 30 overs there will be nothing for the spinners. So, there are a lot of chance for us." "Nobody wants to fail. Imrul and Shahriar (Nafees) did not throw their wickets. Nafees needs time rediscover his Test form." Though the bowlers did not pick all 10 wickets, Shakib was very happy with the three-man pace attack. "I am very happy with the pacers. They really did more than what was expected." India's opening batsman Gautam Gambhir was hopeful to wrap up the match without any hassle. He said the team have played good cricket in the second innings and set a big target for the home team. "The bowlers got us back in the game after we had only a one-run lead. And we always thought that if we could bat well in the second innings then we will set up the game for the bowlers. I think 415 is a very good target. We wanted to have time as well and we wanted to give our bowlers the best chance to win the Test match." "Bangladesh need 348 runs more. If they play positively, anything can happen. Anyway it'll be an interesting game on Thursday." Gambhir played down his unique Test hundred. "I never thought that I would get five consecutive centuries. I don't play for it. My job is to go out there and keep scoring runs for the team. When you play for your country, there is already so much pressure. When you think about it, you only put pressure on yourself rather than making it simple
