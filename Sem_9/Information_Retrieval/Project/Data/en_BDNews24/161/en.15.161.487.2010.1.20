 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  A planning ministry body has summoned the MRP/MRV project director Brig Gen Refayet Ullah to respond to allegations of irregularities in the tender process. He has been asked to appear to appear on Jan 26 at the Sher-e-Bangla office of the implementation, monitoring and evaluation division of the planning ministry to reply the allegation by a French company Oberthur Technologies. Refayet Ullah told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, "The inquiries raised (by IMED) will be answered fairly. No partial role was played in the tender process. The evaluation report was submitted with a right decision." Oberthur, on Jan 5, complained to the central procurement technical unit of the IMED that the tender evaluation committee had showed partiality. Brig Gen Refayet Ullah headed the committee. The tender was floated to introduce machine readable passports and machine readable visas in Bangladesh by an international deadline of April this year, and to supply 2.2 million new passports annually for five years. The winning company was IRIS Corporation Berhad (Malaysia), while other leading contenders were BJ&C Security Printing Co, Ltd (China), Flora Telecom Ltd (Bangladesh), Oberthur Technologies (France). The government, on Jan 14, awarded IRIS the MRP/MRV project, even though concerns were raised that it had been barred by the Turkish government from participating in public tenders until Oct 2011 for failing to complete a similar e-passport project there in time. bdnews2
