<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP, the main opposition party, submitted its ratified party constitution to the Election Commission Thursday. A delegation, led by the BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan, handed in the party's constitution, approved by the party council on Dec 6 2009, to the Election Commission. Khan said, "The amended constitution was approved by the party council in accordance with the RPO (Representation of the People Order) and has been submitted to the commission." He said student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and workers' wing Sramik Dal will run by their own constitutions, in accordance with the RPO conditions. Professional organisations, including the Doctors Association of Bangladesh, will ideally still work with BNP, but they will not remain with the party 'organisationally', Khan said. ALL CONSTITUTIONS IN BAR 2 After receiving the constitution, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said, "We have received the final constitutions of all parties except two." "It is really a matter of joy. It is very positive politically." Huda said, "We will review every provision of the party's constitution. We will write to them for amendment if we see any inconsistency." There are 39 political parties registered with the Election Commission. All parties except the Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal and the Freedom Party have so far submitted their final constitutions. Ruling Awami League submitted its constitution on July 25. EC officials said Samajtantrik Dal had already held its council and was supposed to submit its constitution on Jan 24. However, Freedom Party said it is not possible to submit its constitution in due time amid the "prevailing political atmosphere". Regarding this, Huda said, "Registration will be repealed if the Freedom Party fails to submit its constitution in due time." b
