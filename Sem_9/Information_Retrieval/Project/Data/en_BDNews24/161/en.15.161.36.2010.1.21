 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division has adjourned to Jan 24 the proceedings on two petitions seeking a stay order on the 2005 High Court judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment to the constitution illegal. A full six-member bench of the division, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, on Thursday set the next hearing date on the petitions by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three lawyers. Earlier on Monday, the court had rejected pleas by the petitioners to defer the hearing for eight weeks. Delwar and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan have filed separate petitions seeking a stay on the 2005 High Court judgment. The Supreme Court at the start of this month lifted an earlier stay order on the High Court ruling as the government withdrew a previous leave to appeal seeking to challenge the ruling. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had told the media at the time that with the withdrawal of the leaves to appeal and vacation of the existing stay order, the High Court ruling was upheld, for now, despite the two more pending petitions. The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Marshal Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared regimes between Aug 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman illegal. The petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalised all the regimes between 1975 and 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power -- military or otherwise -- after the assassination of president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. In 2005, an alliance government led by BNP, which was floated with the backing of General Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling. But the incumbent government in May 2009 petitioned the High Court and was permitted to withdraw the leave to appeal, allowing the stay also to be lifted and the judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal to stand. b
