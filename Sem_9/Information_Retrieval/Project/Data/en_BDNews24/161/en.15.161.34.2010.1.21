<TITLE> Jamuna TV petition sent to CJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) A High Court bench on Thursday referred a petition challenging the suspension of Jamuna TV last November to chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam. The bench of justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mamnun Rahman passed on the documents of the petition filed by Jamuna Group managing director Shamim Islam following suspension of the private channel's transmission. The BTRC shut down the test transmission late on Nov 19. The telecoms regulator had asked Jamuna not to go on air without obtaining the 'no-objection' certificate. The same bench on December 5 last had asked the government and the BTRC to explain why the suspension and the cancellation of its frequency were not unlawful. In a rule nisi, the court also asked why seized equipment of the private TV station should not be returned and why the channel should not be issued a final licence. Defence counsel for Jamuna TV said BTRC violated the law by shutting down the transmission. BTRC says Jamuna TV applied for a 'no-objection' certificate last year, but the channel started transmission illegally while the matter was under consideration.
