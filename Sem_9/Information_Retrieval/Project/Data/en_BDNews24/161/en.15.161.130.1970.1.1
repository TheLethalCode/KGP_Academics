 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)--Another 64 BDR members have retracted the confessional statements in court in the Peelkhana murder case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Muminul Hasan heard the withdrawal appeals on Wednesday. The border guards were present at Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at the hearing. At the same time, 13 of those BDR members appealed for bail. The magistrate asked for the confessions to be recorded and denied the bail appeals. Ratan Sheikh, police's recording officer in the court, told bdnews24.com that until now, out of the 2,187 accused, 521 have pleaded guilty. Among them, 186 including Awami League leader Haji Torab Ali have withdrawn their statements. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny last year saw over 73 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, brutally killed in the BDR headquarters in Dhaka. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. Raihan Morshed, lawyer of BDR members carpenter Narayan Chandra Das and sepoy Kamal Hossain, said that his clients had been coerced into pleading guilty with threats of extra-judicial death. So, they have withdrawn their statements. Dhaka metropolitan additional public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukder said, "Nothing has changed with these withdrawal appeals. Once a statement has been given in court, applications of its withdrawal have no evidential value." "But in this case, they might gain evidential value if the claims of torture and blackmail are proved during witnesses' testimony in trial."
