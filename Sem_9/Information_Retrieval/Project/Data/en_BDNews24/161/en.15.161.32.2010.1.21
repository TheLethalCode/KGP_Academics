 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Poverty cannot be eradicated through economic measures alone but must be viewed from the perspective of human rights, Irene Khan, former secretary general of Amnesty International, stresses in a new book launched Thursday in Dhaka. Speaking as chief guest at the launch of the title, The Unheard Truth: Poverty and Human Rights, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said that decades ago, there was no place to talk about rights in the poverty discourse. "But now the space is indeed there." The author Irene Khan said poverty was a relentless process. "It is struggle for freedom justice and dignity." She pointed out that poverty could not be effectively eradicated unless it was recognised that the existence of poverty was intricately linked with the violation of human rights. "I would not argue with the economists, but it is not only growth which can eradicate poverty." Moreover, she said, economic, social and cultural rights should also be treated as human rights. The author also stressed the need to revitalise the Human Rights Commission, Anticorruption Commission and Information Commission to redress the erosion of those rights. Human rights are something "that must be addressed holistically not selectively, not partially", she added. Panna Lal, a representative of the Dalit community in Bangladesh, shared his experience of being discriminated in his locality that was indicative of the general trend of discrimination against minorities. Former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan, also a former finance secretary, began with a humourous anecdote of Gopal Bhar who was asked by King Krishna Chandra, the difference between truth and falsehood. The witty Gopal Bhar had replied that the distance was rather slimit was precisely the distance between the king's eyes and ears. Akbar Ali Khan drew the analogy that Irene Khan had written what she had seen and not what she had heard. This former bureaucrat was also the only one to seriously critique the book and pointed out that author had entirely ignored the issue of resource mobilisation. Rehman Sobhan, chairman of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said there was grave injustice behind the exclusion of rights. Right to health, education, work and food for the people should be made mandatory, he added and cited recent examples in India, which he suggested to the finance minister should be replicated in Bangladesh as well. Special guest Fazle Hasan Abed, founder and chairman of BRAC, agreed that empowerment and rights quite rightly constituted crucial elements of poverty eradication. He related how BRAC, itself had learned from its experience on the field and commended Irene Khan on her book saying that the spirit was very much similar to that of BRAC's. Among others, Hossain Zillur Rahman, a former caretaker government adviser, also spoke at the launch held at the BRAC Cetre Inn. Syed Hashemi, director of BRAC's Development Institute, moderated. Irene Khan is currently serving on the BRAC governing board. bd
