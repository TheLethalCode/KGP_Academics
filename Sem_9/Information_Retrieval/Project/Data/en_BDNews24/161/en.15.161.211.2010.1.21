 Satkhira, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Satkhira special court has adjourned trial proceedings against border guards, accused of siding with the mutiny at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka last year, until March 21. The special court, formed to try BDR mutiny charges, heard testimony in the case from 9:30am until 1pm. Some 15 people have so far given testimony in the case. Sixty accused border guards, belonging to 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur and being held in Satkhira jail, were produced before the court. Charges were framed on Jan 18 against the 60 for breach of discipline, vandalism and looting under the BDR Act. In Wednesday's proceedings 16 of the accused confessed to rebellion and sought mercy from the court. The special court is being convened at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters at Taltoli in Satkhira. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam heads a panel of judges that includes Lt Col Gazi Khalid Hossain and Maj Lutful Karim. Lt Col Alam is prosecutor of the case. The mutiny trial in Satkhira region is the second after the first such trial was held by a special court in Rangamati in November. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The killings will be tried separately under civil law. There have been 31 cases filed across the country on charges related to the BDR mutiny. bdn
