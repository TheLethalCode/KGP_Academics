<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)--The government will drop fake freedom fighters off a list on examining the names given by the MPs, the prime minister has said. "Many fake people had been included in the list during the (BNP-led four-party) alliance government. They have eliminated many real freedom fighters from the list," Sheikh Hasina told parliament during her scheduled question-answer session on Wednesday. "This system should be stopped forever. I ask the MPs to make lists in their constituencies, scrutinise them and identify the fake freedom fighters." The prime minister said what the past government had done with the list was not acceptable. "We should have had a list of war criminals," she said. The house convened at around 3pm with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. Hasina replied to three questions and seven complementary ones. She said during the 1996-2001 term of the Awami League government, the freedom fighters were enlisted and given certificates. She said she had signed 70,000 certificates at that time. "But the alliance government cancelled the certificates and the lists, and included many fake names," the prime minister said. Hasina also blamed former president Ziaur Rahman for the murders of freedom fighters Col Abu Taher, Brig Nazmul Huda and Brig Khaled Mosharraf. Replying to query from Satkhira-2 MP MA Jabbar, the prime minister said the land ministry had taken up a project to carry out a IT-based land survey. A proposal for a development project under public-private partnership has also been finalised and the work will start in the next fiscal year, she said. b
