 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Police say they are puzzled over the "political allegiance" of Dhaka University students depicted in the media bearing firearms in clashes earlier this week, even after their names and academic identities have been tracked down. The university campus was shaken by fighting and gunfire during the armed clashes last Monday that left at least 20 people injured, including Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim and DU proctor AKM Saiful Islam Khan. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) president Sultan Salauddin Tuku was also injured as two factions of JCD, the main pro-opposition student wing, battled over positions in its newly formed committee. Pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League also became involved in the violence at one point, according to witnesses. Police on Tuesday said they were trying to track down the culprits who were seen brandishing arms in front of law enforcers, cameramen and photographers during the violence. Nurul Islam, additional police commissioner of Ramna zone, told bdnews24.com on Thursday: "We have been able to track down their identities by viewing the pictures and film footage." "We have more or less gathered information on all of them. We have discovered their academic status. More investigation is ongoing." "But we are unable to find any clear political allegiance for most. One or two of them might hang out with political student wings, that's all," said the official. Meanwhile, although a probe committee was formed by DU authorities following the violence, a first meeting date has not even been fixed. The eight-member high-powered investigation body was formed at an emergency syndicate meeting on Tuesday with deputy vice chancellor Harun ur Rashid as convener and proctor Saiful Islam as member secretary. Shahbagh police also filed a case on Tuesday against eight top JCD leaders and 200-300 unnamed people. The accused include JCD central committee general secretary Amirul Islam Alim, senior vice-president Shahidul Islam Babul, joint secretaries Amirul Islam Khan and Asaduzzaman Palash, organising secretary Anisur Rahman Khokon, cultural secretary Tariqul Isalm Titu, social welfare secretary Mahbubul Alam Azam and Ferdous Ahmed Munna. Shahbagh police have yet to file a case based on a complaint by Chhatra Dal. Regarding the JCD complaint, Islam said, "No decisions have been taken over the case yet. We are conducting primary investigations." He continued to say, "Mainly the complaint accused 34/39 persons for the attack on their president. Of them 14 were named and the rest are unknown. The 14 named are all JCL leaders and workers. Now verification is needed on whether these 14 were involved in the clashes or even if involved, participated in the attack on Tuku. Time is needed to come to decision." "Many were not in any way linked with the clash. Maybe they participated in the showdown. But we are looking into matters like whether they actually directly attacked Tuku as described in the complaint," ended the assistant commissioner. Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com, on Thursday evening, about the activities of the probe and said, "The date of the meeting was to be set today (Thursday). But as the member secretary, I am collecting video footages, cuttings of newspaper and other evidences. Hopefully we would be able to finish investigations within two weeks." When asked whether the delay would allow criminals to escape, the proctor said, "Those who are our students will have to come to the university. There is no way they cannot escape." Responding to queries about who hit him, Islam said, "I could not see in the crowd. I was not even aware that I was hit. I found out later. The blow could have been intended for me or it could have been for Tuku that hit me." On the other hand, controversial JCD member of Dhaka College, Pasha has not been arrested yet. Deputy commissioner (south) of detective police Monirul Islam told bdnews24.com on Thursday evening, "Pasha had gone into hiding after the incident. We are looking for him and operations are being conducted both in and out of Dhaka." Meanwhile JCD is taking preparations to file case at court regarding the incident as Shahbagh police refused to file charges yet. JCD law secretary Kamruzzaman said, "We have taken preparations to press charges at court. We will be filing the case on Sunday.
