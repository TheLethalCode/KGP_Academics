 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)--The government is mulling over elections to DUCSU and other students' associations, the education minister said on Wednesday. "Authorities of all educational institutions are thinking of holding elections to all students' associations including Dhaka University Central Students' Union," Nurul Islam Nahid told parliament during a question-answer session. Authorities have already talked to a number of student organisations, he said. Replying to a query from Gazipur-5 MP Meher Afroz, Nahid said there are 147 government secondary girls' schools across the country where 98,500 students are studying. It costs a student Tk 973 a month and Tk 11,686 a year. FREE EDUCATION IN PHASES Answering a question from Rajshahi-6 MP Md Shahriar Alam, the minister said the government is planning to make education free for all up to secondary level to raise the rate of literacy to 100 percent. It is examining financial issues to expand it up to degree level, he said. LAWS TO STOP PRIVATE TUITION Nahid said the government is considering a law to stop private tuitions and coaching system. He said government secondary schools have been asked not to charge annual session fees beyond Tk 700 while private schools asked to charge development fees not more than Tk 5,000. The minister said the draft of regulations on the government's Monthly Pay Order-listed institutions and private institutions are at the final stage. On issuance of a circular, the education institutions will be enlisted on MPO on their fulfilling the conditions of regulations and budget allocation. The draft was likely to be finalised in a week, Nahid said. Teachers and employees of educational institutions enlisted under the government's monthly pay order (MPO) programme will get pay hikes in line with the new national pay scale. bd
