 Chittagong, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Two crewmen were missing after a fertiliser-laden lighter vessel went down in the outer anchorage of Chittagong port Wednesday night, officials said. The MV C Samrat was carrying 35 crewmembers and nine others, radio control operator Wahidur Rahman told bdnews24.com. He said the ship was heading towards port from the deep with 7,600 sacks of fertiliser from a Panama-flagged ship Constantinos G. The Samrat sank at around 11pm as it approached 'A Anchorage'. Rahman said the port authority, Coast Guard and Navy were trying to recover the vessel. It was not hampering other port traffic, he added. Local agent SM Shippers owns the Samrat. bdnews
