 MELBOURNE, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer's straight sets demolition of Romanian Victor Hanescu on Thursday served a timely reminder to the men who would be king that on centre court he still rules supreme. Federer's patchy form in the leadup to the Australian Open had given fresh hope to his rivals while a shaky first-round victory over Igor Andreev on Tuesday did little to silence talk of new dynasties.
