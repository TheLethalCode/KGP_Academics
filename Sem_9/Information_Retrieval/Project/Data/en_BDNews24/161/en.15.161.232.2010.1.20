 NEW DELHI/CANBERRA, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's foreign minister said on Wednesday that attacks on Indian students in Australia needed to stop immediately, while Australia's former military chief said the attacks had a strong racial element. The attacks over the past 18 months, including the fatal stabbing of a 21-year-old Indian graduate this month, have strained ties with India and hurt Australia's lucrative foreign student market, its third largest export earner, worth $13 billion Australian dollars ($12 billion) in 2007-08. "Unless there is an immediate stop to all such attacks, our people-to-people level exchanges which includes education and tourism will get adversely affected," S.M.

Rather than say 'nothing to worry about', I'd rather look more closely," Cosgrove added, making the comments after delivering a speech on race relations. He pointed to previous racial violence in Australia, saying clashes on Sydney beaches in 2005 between gangs of ethnic Lebanese and anglo youths had highlighted dark pockets of racism. "It was so unusual and unexpected, it reverberated around the world. It was unexpected because Australia's reputation was that of an egalitarian and multi-ethnic society; tolerant, cheerful and relaxed. December 2005 gave us pause for thought," Cosgrove said. He said criminal elements might be behind the attacks on Indians but, in contrast to police and government ministers, added that the racial element was too strong to dismiss. Cosgrove, voted Australian of the year in 2001, said hidden racism should not be allowed to fester or lead to a reduction in immigration, expected to boost Australia's population from 21 million to around 36 million by 2
