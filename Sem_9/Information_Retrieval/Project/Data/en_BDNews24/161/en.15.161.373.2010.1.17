<TITLE> Chile magnate may oust left, fights Pinochet ghost </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A conservative billionaire has a paper-thin lead heading into Chile's presidential election on Sunday as he bids to end 20 years of centre-left rule, but is wrestling with the ghost of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Airline magnate Sebastian Pinera is seen narrowly beating Eduardo Frei, a former president from the leftist bloc that has governed the world's top copper producer since the end of Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship. A win by Harvard-trained economist Pinera would mark a shift to the right in a region dominated by leftist rulers from Venezuela to Argentina, although no major changes to economic policy are expected whoever wins. Many Chileans are disenchanted with the ruling centre-left "Concertacion" coalition, and say the government could have made better use of billions of dollars in copper boom savings. They are also fed up that an old guard dominates politics. "The Concertacion has been in power for so long. It's time for a change," said 60-year-old Silvia Salinas, a housewife from the modest suburb of Renca on the outskirts of Santiago. "We should give Pinera a chance." A MORI poll on Wednesday showed Pinera winning the run-off with 50.9 percent of the vote, against 49.1 percent for Frei -- well within a 3-percentage-point margin of error. Pinera, ranked No. 701 on the Forbes global rich list, won 44 percent in the Dec. 13 first-round vote, while Frei took 29.6 percent. It was the first time the right outpolled the left in a presidential vote since Chile returned to democracy in 1990. With the field narrowed, both Frei and Pinera scrambled to woo the supporters of a maverick independent who divided the left, polled third with 20 percent and missed the run-off. NAIL-BITING FINISH Former film producer Marco Enriquez-Ominami finally gave Frei a lukewarm endorsement on Wednesday, and his support could prove a factor in the race, although analysts say it was likely too little, too late. Pinera, 60, who made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile and has a major stake in flagship airline LAN, has benefited from divisions in the ruling coalition. He has sought to distance himself from the bloody legacy of Pinochet's rule, when more than 3,000 people were killed or "disappeared" and about 28,000 people were tortured, and has reached out to the large middle class. One of his brothers was a minister under Pinochet and some of his aides worked for the dictatorship, and Pinera has found himself on the defensive as Frei has cast the right that Pinera leads as the former strongman's heirs. Some analysts wonder if a Pinochet fear factor could help swing the vote in Frei's favor. Pinera has vowed to give Chile's state-owned enterprises a business-like overhaul to boost efficiency, promising to create a million jobs and boost economic growth to average 6 percent a year after a contraction in 2009 amid the first recession since the Asian crisis a decade ago. His critics say his plan depends too heavily on the private sector generating jobs and banks on a steady global recovery maintaining copper demand. Pinera could also struggle to push reforms through a divided Congress. "Of course the Concertacion did good things and we have recognized and applauded that, but it shows fatigue, its motor has stopped, it has run out of fuel," Pinera said, wrapping up his campaign before the vote. Pinera is the market favourite, and analysts forecast a win would give extra momentum in the near term to a stock market rally continuing from 2009 on a recovery from global crisis and sharp price gains for the main export, copper. Frei, whose 1994-2000 presidency was shaken by recession, vows to continue with popular President Michelle Bachelet's welfare policies and says his priorities include labour reform. He has also adopted several of leftist Enriquez-Ominami's policies, vowing to overhaul the tax system and boost revenue from mining royalties, and some investors are wary about how far Frei will go to accommodate him. He has also sought to revive memories of the right's support for Pinochet. "We may have made errors, but we did not commit horrors," Frei said during the final days of campaigni
