 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh crashed out of the ICC U-19 World Cup in New Zealand after suffering a heartbreaking four-wicket defeat against Pakistan on Wednesday. The Junior Tigers needed to win in order to qualify for quarter-finals at the expense of West Indies the other side in the 'group of death'. The day had begun well for Bangladesh after their decision to bat was vindicated by a strong batting show in Palmerston North. Openers Anamul Haque and Amit Majumder laid the foundation with a steady stand of 92 in 23.1 overs. Anamul carried on his good form in the tournament, before he fell for 55. Mominul Haque kept the Bangladesh flag flying in the middle overs and set them up for a strong finish, which was provided by captain Mahmudul Hasan who slammed 63 at close to run-a-ball. Shabbir Rahman upped the ante with Hasan, striking two sixes and two fours in his 34. Alauddin Babu who came in for the last ball of the innings smote a six to take his side to 250. Chasing 251 to maintain their 100 percent record and top Group D, Pakistan seemed to be going down when they lost their sixth wicket at 199, with 21 balls to go. But Mohammad Waqas who came in at number eight had other ideas, smashing two sixes and three fours in his 14-ball 34 that turned the match on its head. Bangladesh earlier beat Papua New Guinea by five wickets on D/L method and lost to West Indies by one run in another last-over thriller.
