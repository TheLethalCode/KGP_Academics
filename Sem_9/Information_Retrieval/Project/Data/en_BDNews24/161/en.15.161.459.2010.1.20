 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)--The government has launched enquiry to track down the people involved in irregularities and corruption with distribution of textbooks, the education minister said on Wednesday. A committee has been formed to to ensure that textbooks reach all the remaining students free of cost by Jan 31, Nurul Islam Nahid said at a press briefing. Earlier, he attended at a meeting of the supervising committee on textbook distribution for 2010. The three-member high-power committee comprises the chairman of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board and directors-general of the secondary and higher studies directorate and the primary education directorate. The minister, terming the printing, binding, supply and distribution process 'a huge task', said, "We found a few lapses in some cases. These things will be overcome at the beginning of next year when we will learn from the mistakes." Nahid said the government will not put up with irregularities, negligence or corruption in the textbooks distribution process. "Books must be delivered to the students immediately after the schools get those in hand," he added. Distribution of books for the primary level will be initiated by the ministry, he said, adding books in English version will be distributed soon. Earlier in the day, an education officer of Dhaka district was suspended for irregularities over distribution of textbooks.
