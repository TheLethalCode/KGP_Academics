 LONDON, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of Britons claiming jobless benefit fell last month by the biggest amount since April 2007, but the dip masked an increase in the number of people who have given up the search for work, official data showed Wednesday. The Office for National Statistics said the number of people claiming jobless benefit fell by 15,200 in December, well above forecasts for a fall of 2,500 and coming on top of an upwardly revised decline of 10,800 in November. The ILO jobless rate for the three months to November fell to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent in October after the first fall in 18 months in the number of people looking for work but without a job. At the same time the number of people actually in a job dropped by 14,000 to 28.921 million in the three months to November. The shortfall was made up by an increase in the proportion of the labour force neither in work nor looking for a job, which rose to 21.2 percent in the three months to November, the highest since August 2007. This took the absolute number to 8.046 million people, the highest since records began in 1971. The data highlight the uncertain outlook for the economy, with signs that unemployment is turning the corner but fuelling concerns about the pace of recovery given that many people seem to be withdrawing from the labour market. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said in a keynote speech late Tuesday that macroeconomic uncertainty meant that central bankers were waiting for conditions to become clearer before making definitive choices on monetary policy. Gilt futures pared gains after the data and BoE minutes released at the same time, as investors initially took the figures as broadly positive on economic growth. But economists had some reservations. "The jobless figures show a rather steeper than expected decline in the claimant count but it does seem that many people are moving out of the labour market, which is what you would expect to see at this stage," said Stephen Lewis, economist at Monument Securities. "It looks as though the labour market has stabilised, but whether it remains that way depends on the way demand develops." The ONS also published its new Average Weekly Earnings series, a cash-based measure which it says provides a more reliable gauge of wage developments in the economy and replacing the old Average Earnings Index. This showed average weekly earnings rose by an annual 0.7 percent in the three months to November to 451 pounds. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings rose 1.1 percent to 424 pounds -- the smallest increase since the series began in 2001. The old average earnings index showed a 1.6 percent annual rise in the three months to November, in line with forecasts. The ONS said the difference between the two series was due to a shift towards lower-paid occupations which is better reflected in the new Average Weekly Earnings seri
