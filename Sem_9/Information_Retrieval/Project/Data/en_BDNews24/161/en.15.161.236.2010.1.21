 Chittagong, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Despite Mushfiqur Rahim's maiden century, India clinched the first Test on the fifth and final day at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Thursday. India won by 113 runs after dismissing Bangladesh for 301. Spinner Amit Mishra bagged four wickets. Sachin Tendulkar was the man-of-the-match. The second Test commences in Dhaka on Jan 24. Rahim (101) was the last wicket to go when he came down the track to launch it over Ojha at long-off but couldn't, the substitute fielder dived forward to complete a good catch and seal victory.

That was Dravid's 190th Test catch. India set Bangladesh an improbable 415-run target on Wednesday after declaring their second innings on 413-8. The tourists (243) took a one-run lead after dismissing the home side for 242. And before the first drinks break they slipped to 97-4 when Raqibul Hasan was out lbw for 13 to Sharma.
