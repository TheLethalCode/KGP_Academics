<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines will resume Dhaka-New York flights this March, civil aviation minister told parliament on Thursday, after their failure to take off as planned last November. The government has completed all necessary preparations, Golam Mohammed Quader said, replying to a supplementary question. On another question by Dinajpur-2 MP Khalid Mahmud, Quader said the state carrier would acquire a Boeing 777-200ER and two Boeing 373-800s in January, one Airbus A 310-300 in February 2010 and another Boeing 777-200ER in March. He also said training of Biman employees was also complete to handle the new aircraft on the long-haul trans-Atlantic flight. The airline introduced its New York flight in December 1993 with one flight a week. This was gradually increased to three a week in June 2000. Operations on the New York route were suspended in July 2006 as the state was incurring financial losses of around Tk 40 lakh on each flight, while its fleet was also suffering from a shortage of aircraft. Quader told parliament more aircraft would be procured on lease to replace the older planes and maintain Biman's operations in the longer term. The minister said Biman was eyeing two Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011, two in 2013, two Boeing 737-800s in 2015, two more Boeings in 2019 and two 787-8 airliners in 2020. COX'S BAZAR TO BE 'TOURIST CITY' Replying to another question form HM Golam Reza from Satkhira-4, the minister said a master-plan is underway to make Cox's Bazar a tourist city. To support the plan, formation of Cox's Bazar Development Authority is under the government's active consideration, he said. bdn
