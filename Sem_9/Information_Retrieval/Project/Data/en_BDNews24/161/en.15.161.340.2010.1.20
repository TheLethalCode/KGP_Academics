<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has said employment of domestic workers under 14 years of age will be made illegal, in an amendment of labour laws to cover rights of the long-ignored working population. "Fair pay and ensuring human rights for domestic workers will be included in an amendment of the labour act," the minister said after a meeting of the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS) on Wednesday. Hossain said their appointment will also be brought under legal framework. He said his ministry had already formed a sub-committee to assess the necessary amendments to the law. The meeting, presided over by BILS president Habibur Rahman, heard recommendations from the institute to make appointment letters mandatory for employers and to bring domestic workers under minimum wage, which was bypassed even in the most recent amendment of labour laws in 2006. "It's a shame for us that we could not bring household workers under a legal framework in the long years since liberation," said the labour minister. "But laws alone can't ensure their rights," he said. "We need social movements and awareness for the need of change." SECURITY OF OVERSEAS WORKERS Hossain said the government has taken measures to ensure security of workers abroad. The minister, whose remit includes expatriates welfare and oversees employment, also said sending women workers abroad came to a halt, after the current government came to power last year, following some torture incidents that took place. "But the government has resumed sending women workers overseas, as the illegal trafficking of women rose due to the halt," he said. Some seven million Bangladeshis are currently employed overseas, most of them in Arab countries. bdnew
