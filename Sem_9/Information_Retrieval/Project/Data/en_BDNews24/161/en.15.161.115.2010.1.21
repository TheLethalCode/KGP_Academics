<TITLE> Karzai seeks donor backing for Taliban reintegration plan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai will present a plan to donors next week aimed at pulling in lower to mid-level Taliban fighters but he faces scepticism over whether it will be any better than previous efforts. "Can't be worse," commented US special envoy Richard Holbrooke, when asked how the new program -- set to be presented at a conference in London on January 28 -- would be different from past failed attempts. A key question, say experts, is whether the Afghan government has the ability to pull in tens of thousands of Afghan fighters from the hills by offering stipends, job training and education, as well as protection that has previously not been there. "My biggest concern is whether the Afghan government has the capacity to do it. What is the plan both at a national level and province-by-province," said Brian Katulis, an expert on Afghanistan from the Centre for American Progress, a Washington-based thinktank. The Afghan official in charge of the program, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, said final details were being sorted out and there would be a meeting of elders and influential leaders from the provincial and district levels -- after the London conference. The plan, said Stanekzai, was to offer protection to insurgents who gave themselves in and to ensure they got jobs that prevented them from a return to "planting bombs." "This will be a broader, detailed program and it will be implemented at all levels ... They need to be able to join the peace process with dignity," he told Reuters in an interview this week. Previous efforts to win over Taliban fighters failed because little attempt was made to offer protection or financial incentives. Several diplomats estimated the new plan could cost up to $1 billion (613 million pounds) for the programme, with some pledges expected to be made at the London conference next week. Britain, Japan and the United States are expected to come up with the bulk of the money, said one Western diplomat, adding that several hundred million dollars had been offered so far. EXCLUSIONS Not everyone would be included in the offer and US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said, for example, it was not realistic to assume that Taliban leader Mullah Omar would be among those who gave themselves up. Moreover, the Afghan government is not prepared to offer a blanket amnesty and those who refuse to denounce al Qaeda and other militant groups will not be accepted. "We have to be able to differentiate between those who can't separate themselves from al Qaeda and continue with violence," said Stanekzai. "The aim here is to reduce the threat and to promote a message that people can live in tolerance." Another concern is that the reintegration plan may not go hand-in-hand with reconciliation efforts, which is key to turning around the war, said outgoing UN envoy Kai Eide. "The process of reintegration without reconciliation will not work. We have to get that on the way," Eide said. The Taliban have repeatedly rejected government offers of reconciliation, saying they will not hold talks as long as there are foreign forces in Afghanistan. The new programme comes at a time when the insurgency is at its strongest since the Taliban were ousted from power in late 2001, and fighters who think victory is in sight may be less interested in any offer. However, the hope was the "surge" of an additional 30,000 US forces would put more pressure on fighters and make the choice easier. "I think with the building of pressure from the surge and our forces, this puts a more positive message that they are not on the winning side," said Stanekzai. The plan is also to ensure that whole communities are rewarded and those handing themselves in are not the only ones to get stipends and special treatment. "The Afghans have a great saying -- if you sweat for it, you protect it' and so getting highly localized development in the hands of communities is critical," said an ISAF official. "A key part of the program will be to shift the focus of development programs down to the local level," he added. Many of the jobs are likely to focus on agricultural work, which the United States has labelled the most important non-security priority in Afghanist
