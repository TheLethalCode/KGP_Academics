 By Tanim Ahmed bdnews24.com assistant editor Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has rejected a new World Bank report projecting a downward economic trend for Bangladesh for two consecutive years. Global Economic Prospects (GEP) 2010, launched worldwide on Thursday, projected Bangladesh's economic growth dipped to 5.9% in FY 2009 and would continue further down to 5.5% in FY 2010, from 6.2% in FY 2008. A modest recovery in FY 2011, projected at 5.8%, would still fall short of the government's targeted six per cent growth. Muhith in his budget speech last June projected GDP growth between 5.5-6.0% for FY 2010. Since then he has consistently held that growth would not dip below 6% in this fiscal. When asked about the World Bank's estimates for 2009 and projections for the following two years 2010 and 2011, the finance minister did not accept the projections of growth below six percent. "I reject it," he told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based research organisation, told bdnews24.com that the trend since July 2009 suggest a growth between 5.5% and 6%. "Of course one cannot tell whether it is going to be closer to 5.5 or 6 percent." Refraining from making any comment on the WB projections, he suggested that the estimation based on current trends was quite in line. GEP 2010 The WB publication said global economic recovery would slow later in 2010 as impact of fiscal stimulus begins to wane, which is probably the reason that economies have lower growth rates in 2010 followed by modest recovery in 2011. It says the financial markets would still remain troubled while low household spending would mean a weak private sector and high joblessness. The report notes that recovery will slow down later into the year when the economies will gradually have to fare on their own with little or no stimulus. "Overall, after falling for two to three quarters, global GDP has begun recovering, and output is expected to grow rapidly during the remainder of 2009 and into the first half of 2010." Global GDP is expected to grow 2.7% in 2010, rising from 2.2% in 2009. It is expected to reach 3.2% in 20111. Developing countries have a far better prospect of a faster recovery according to the publication. It projects 5.2% growth this year followed by 5.8% growth next year for developing countries. But the GDP in rich countries, however, are expected to rise much more slowly  1.8% in 2010 and 2.3% in 2011. World trade volumes, which fell by a staggering 14.4 percent in 2009, are projected to expand by 4.3 and 6.2 percent this year and in 2011, said a release. SOUTH ASIA The GEP observes that this region appears to have escaped the worst impacts of the crisis. But the estimated 5.7% growth last year, which was the same in the previous year, apparently signified a strong slowdown from the boom. The reason is perhaps explained by falling investment in the region, according to the publication. The region's recovery does not present a starkly different picture compared to that of the rest of the world falling from 6.9% in 2008 to 6% in 2009, followed by 7% and 7.4% in 2010 and 2011. But it should be pointed out that while the recovery of other economies of the region was modest, it was India's figures that lifted them up. Falling from 9.1% growth in 2007, Indian growth remained at a low of 6% and 6.1% for the following two years. It is projected to shoot up to 7.5% in 2010 and 8% next
