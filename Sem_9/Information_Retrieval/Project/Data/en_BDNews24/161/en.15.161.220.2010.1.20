 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said the government's policy of pressing charges to silence the opposition will not succeed. His sounded the warning at a meeting organised by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal marking the 74th birth anniversary of late president Ziaur Rahman at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium on Wednesday. Delwar said, "The coalition government, under the guise of democracy, is attacking us in an autocratic manner. BNP's forward march cannot be subdued in this manner, nor can the government stop its fall in popularity and power." He also demanded withdrawal of the 'false cases' filed against JCD activists over Monday's armed violence at Dhaka University. "Not only is the government not withdrawing the political and false cases against BNP workers filed during the emergency caretaker tenure, they are filing more. "Recently, they have filed cases against top JCD leaders regarding the Dhaka University incident. BNP cannot be wiped out by filing charges", said Delwar. Questioning the popularity of the government, he said, "I am not asking you to hold interim elections, but hold polls in some areas to test popularity. The people will give their verdict against you." The session was presided over by JCD vice president Ali Haider Lenin as president Sultan Salauddin Tuku is injured and general secretary Amirul Islam Alim was absent along with other senior leaders due to charges filed against him. BNP standing committee member Mirza Abbas, senior joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, joint secretary general Amanullah Aman, student affairs secretary Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie, among others, spoke at the session.
