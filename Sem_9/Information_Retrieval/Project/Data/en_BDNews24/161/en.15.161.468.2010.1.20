 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)--The National Identity Registration Bill 2010 was passed in parliament on Wednesday. The national ID card will remain valid for 15 years from the day of issuance. The bill provides for maximum seven years' jail for ID forgery. The bill says that those who are qualified for voting will get national ID. The bill--tabled by law minister Shafique Ahmed on Oct 28 last year following recommendations by parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry--was passed in voice vote. Six months before the expiry, the holder has to apply to the Election Commission for re-registration by paying fee. The National Identity Registration Authority Ordinance 2008 was promulgated by the last caretaker government. In the first session of the current parliament, the ordinance was presented on Jan 25 last year but it lapsed after 30 days.
