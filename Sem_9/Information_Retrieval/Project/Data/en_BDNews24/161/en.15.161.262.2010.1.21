 Sikander Ali Staff Correspondent  bdnews24.com Chittagong, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Mushfiqur Rahman opted to look at the positives after losing the first Test against India by 113 runs on Thursday. "We nearly took 20 wickets. Our pace bowlers did the job and Shakib [Al Hasan], as always, contributed a lot. Tamim Iqbal batted really well too," he said before pinpointing the problem that led Bangladesh squander a great chance. "The first session was very important for us. We knew we needed to keep our wickets intact, but we lost three in that session. Losing Ashraful and Tamim was not part of the plan. Both are very experienced players who could have hung around and scored centuries. That's where we lost the Test. "If some of the other top-order batsmen can also score some runs, we can do really well in the second Test," the Bangladesh vice-captain added. Even though the situation was turning grimmer by the minute, the plucky wicketkeeper-batsman wanted to break his sequence of scores in the 30s or 40s. "I knew I was running out of partners so I stepped up a gear. I also kept telling the other batsmen to enjoy themselves and not worry about the score." And Rahim certainly had fun cracking the fastest Test hundred by a Bangladeshi (101 off 114 balls). Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan unsurprisingly went on the defensive while trying to explain the loss. "I think we lost the match because we couldn't add 100 more runs in the first innings." Stand-in Indian captain Virender Sehwag believed Bangladesh did not bat well and victory was the result of an improved batting performance in the second innings. "They did not bat well. I think they bowled well in the first innings because conditions were helpful. We definitely batted well in the second innings as we put 400-odd runs on the board. It was difficult for Bangladesh to chase those runs." He again reiterated his stand that Bangladesh were not good enough to take 20 wickets against India. "No. They can't. They still didn't get 20 wickets." But like any good leader Sehwag did not forget to pay tribute to his team-mates. "Ishant (Sharma) bowled very well as a first change bowler. He picked up four or five wickets. He is a good prospect for India. Sachin is a very, very special player for us and he is doing a wonderful job for us. He tries to get big runs in every innings. So, our job is to tell him that it's okay when you get out early on
