<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University held exams and some classes on Thursday, the second day of a JCD-imposed strike on the campus. Police barred the JCD leaders from entering the campus in the morning. All scheduled examinations were held, exam controller Bahalul Haque told bdnews24.com. The pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal earlier called a two-day strike on the campus, Tuesday and Thursday, to press their demand for resignation of the vice-chancellor over violent clashes between two JCD factions on Monday. Armed clashes between the two JCD groups, over positions in the student wing's newly formed committee, left at least 20 people injured, including Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim, DU proctor Prof Saiful Islam Khan and JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku. JCD later blamed the university authorities and their rival Bangladesh Chhatra League for the violence. Shahbagh police filed on Tuesday a case against eight top JCD leaders, including general secretary Amirul Islam Aleem. bdn
