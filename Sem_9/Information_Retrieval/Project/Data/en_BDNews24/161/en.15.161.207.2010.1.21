 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)The land ministry has drafted a law to facilitate lease out of sand pits by putting the contract out to tender in a bid to end irregularities. Ministry officials said the law will provide for awarding licences and tender process in place of the present lease-out process. Deputy secretary of the ministry Shankar Chandra Basu told bdnews24.com that a committee was formed, with the ministry's joint secretary (legal wing) as its chief, on Thursday to finalise the draft. The officials said the committee would finalise the draft by the month-end and send it to the cabinet in the second week of February. They said land ministry used to lease out all the sand pits in different rivers until 1992, when the government by enacting a law placed a number of such pits under the disposal of energy and mineral resources, shipping and water resources ministries. The move created scopes for politically influential people to grab the quarries and deprive the government of huge revenues. In 2008, the caretaker government formulated a policy and formed an authority to lease out the pits through tender. The incumbent government formed a national committee, comprising seven secretaries and one additional secretaries, to formulate a law. The committee sat on Thursday to discuss the development. b
