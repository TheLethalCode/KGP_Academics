 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged imams and religious leaders on Wednesday to come forward and prevent bids to spreading communalism and militancy in the country. Speaking as chief guest at an imam training convention, she told the religious leaders to unmask the culprits using the true interpretation of Islam as a peaceful religion. "There is no scope for violence or militancy in this religion." The prime minister reminded the Muslim clerics of their crucial role in society as opinion leaders and observed: "You can play a significant role in socio-economic aspects." She said the government would be able to root out corruption with the active cooperation and assistance of imams. Hasina urged them to stand against drug addiction, violence, illiteracy, child marriage, acid violence and other social ills. The prime minister also took the opportunity to accuse the main opposition BNP of spreading a propaganda alleging the government of selling out the nation. The prime minister urged the imams to make people more aware of such misinformation through their good offices. Hasina said that it was during the past tenure of the opposition BNP and its allies, which was hell bent on maligning the present government, that alcohol licenses were issued "rampantly". She pointed out that Islamist parties had formed government with the opposition too, referring to the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and other coalition partners who were in government between 2001 and 2006. "They only exploit Islam to get to power." She said the main opposition was actually capitalising on the people's belief in religion to further their political interests. The prime minister awarded crests, certificates and cheques at the event held at the Bangabandhu International Convention Centre. Religion minister, Shahjahan Miah chaired the event, jointly organsied by the religious affairs ministry, Islamic Foundation and UNICEF. b
