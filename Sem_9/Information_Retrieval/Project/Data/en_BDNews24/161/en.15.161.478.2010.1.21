 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)The police have told a parliamentary watchdog that introduction of automated traffic signals last December has eased traffic management in the capital, but traffic police were forced to manage junctions manually again in many cases as the signal lights had run out of order. The parliamentary standing committee on Nov 15 last year recommended the police to reactivate the capital's traffic signals after years of non-use and neglect. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police reported to the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs on Thursday that the city's traffic management improved after introduction of the automated signals from December 8 last year. "After the introduction of the auto signaling system, the pressure on the traffic police has eased and the police have made headway in implementing the traffic law," said a report of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, presented to the watchdog body meeting at parliament building. "But most of the traffic signals have gone out of order. So, in many cases the police also need to flout the signals and check traffic manually," the paper said. "The police should not manage traffic manually," the report recommended. It said that the police were in discussion with Dhaka City Corporation to reactivate the signals. They said they were monitoring the commercial city buses to stop them drop and pick passengers at places other than those designated. "The police have been trying to force the drivers to run the buses with gates locked. "Filing of cases for obstructing roads is also going on," it said. The meeting was also told that 1,587 road obstruction cases were filed between Dec 8 last year and Jan 15 this year. The committee chairman Abdus Salam presided over the meeting, attended by senior home ministry and police officials.
