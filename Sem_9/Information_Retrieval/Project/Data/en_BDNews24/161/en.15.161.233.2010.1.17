 MADRID, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid squandered a chance to move a point clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga when they slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Bilbao's inspired goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz pulled off a string of superb saves to deny Real's expensively-assembled strikeforce and a third loss of the campaign for Manuel Pellegrini's side leaves them on 41 points from 18 matches. Champions Barca have 43 points from 17 games and can stretch their lead to five with a win over fifth-placed Sevilla at the Nou Camp later on Saturday (2100 GMT).

France forward Benzema came closest when his low shot bounced back off the inside of the post in the 34th minute. Gaps were opening up in the visitors' defence as Real pushed forward in search of an equaliser in the second half and a defensive slip almost let in Llorente for a second in the 88th but his shot was beaten away by Iker Casillas. FRUSTRATING NIGHT Iraizoz made his best save of the match in the first minute of added time when he flung himself acrobatically to tip away a powerful Ronaldo drive. The Portugal forward ended a frustrating night when he sent a freekick sailing over the bar into the jubilant home crowd. Gurpegi was sent off in the fifth minute of added time for a second booking but it failed to take the gloss off fired-up Bilbao's victory. Earlier on Saturday, Juanfran and Walter Pandiani struck inside the first 10 minutes to give Osasuna a 2-0 home win over Espanyol that lifted the Pamplona-based club to 12th. Third-placed Valencia host local rivals Villarreal on Sunday, with both clubs looking to bounce back after elimination from the King's Cup in mid
