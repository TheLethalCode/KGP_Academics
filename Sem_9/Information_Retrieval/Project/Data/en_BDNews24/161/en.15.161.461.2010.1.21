 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)The BNP has snubbed the prime minister's 'irresponsible' remarks in parliament about late president Ziaur Rahman. The main opposition rushed a media briefing at its Naya Paltan headquarters on Thursday where secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Sehikh Hasina had deliberately lied. "The way she talked about a late president is unjust and inappropriate for her position. She had only revealed her narrow- mindedness by giving the speech." Hasina on Wednesday questioned about the burial and grave of Zia at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. She also accused him of having a hand in the murders of freedom fighters colonel Abu Taher, brigadier general Khaled Mosharraf and brigadier Nazmul Huda. Delwar said: "The prime minister, after being unsuccessful in running the country, is giving false speeches to puzzle the people. It was not right for her to deliver such speech being in a position as important as the prime minister." He referred to the thousands of people who had attended the Janaza of the late president when his body had arrived at Dhaka. Members of Hasina's Awami League also participated in it. "Now she says that the body of Ziaur Rahman was not there." The secretary-general also slammed the premier's reference to Chittagong's Rangunia where Zia was first buried. "Our standing committee member, Salauddin Quader Chowdhury was present when Ziaur Rahman's body was raised from his grave. Then the body was examined at Chittagong CMH," Delwar said. He criticised her for terming Zia a murderer and said, "I do not know what has happened to the prime minister, whether she is making such comments because of being unable to rule the country properly or because she is secluded from the people." He refuted Hasina's allegations that the BNP had rehabilitated the Razakars who had sided with the Pakistani occupation forces during the nation's independence war in 1971. "The people know who went to Golam Azam's residence in 1991 for blessings. Awami league joined forces in the movement for the non-partisan caretaker government bill put forward by Jamaat-e-Islami." "Being on the side of Awami League makes Razakars, freedom fighters, everything Halal (right). This is their two-faced policy." Responding to questions about the confession given by banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-islami chief Mufti Hannan, Delwar said, "Mufti Hannan, Bangla Bhai were arrested in the tenure of the former coalition government. They were brought to law and prosecuted because BNP does not shelter terrorism. "Now a confession has been forced out of him and that is being publicised on television and other media." Standing committee members Mirza Abbas, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, Salahuddin Kader Chowdhury and other leaders were present at the briefing.
