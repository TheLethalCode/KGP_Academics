 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh wants to sign an "ad hoc" deal with India on Teesta water sharing immediately after a JRC meeting slated for March, the foreign minister said on Wednesday. "The government wants to sign an ad hoc deal with India after the ministerial meeting of the Joint River Commission in March," Dipu Moni told a roundtable discussion in the city, on Bangla-Indo ties. The Bangladesh government does not want to wait for results of joint hydrological observations on the river, said the minister delivering her address as chief guest. She also said stressed the importance of regional basin management of common rivers with a view to tapping hydroelectric power. English-language newspaper The Independent and the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies jointly organised the discussion on the prime minister's recent India visit. Bangladesh and India in a joint communiqu, issued during Sheikh Hasina's Delhi visit, said the two neighbouring countries would expedite the negotiations on Teesta water sharing to reach an agreement soon. The communiqu also mentions that the ministerial level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission will take place in March this year to finalise a deal on Teesta sharing. The two countries in a joint statement during Dipu Moni's India visit in September last year also agreed that a joint technical team would carry out a hydrological survey on the Teesta. The data generated on water flow would be used in finalising the water sharing deal. Technical expert level and secretary level meetings of the JRC have already taken place, which "narrowed down" differences between the two neighbours over Teesta sharing. Meanwhile Bangladesh's largest irrigation project, covering an area of 750,000 hectares of land, depends on the Teesta, a common river originating from India. India diverts water in the upstream with a barrage in Gazoldoba. Every year, during the dry season, the Teesta faces a water crunch, leaving Bangladesh's major rice producing region of Rangpur dry. Bangladesh says it cannot go ahead with the second phase of the Teesta irrigation project due to annual water shortages in the river. 'JOINT EFFORTS TO TAP REGIONAL POWER' Dipu Moni also stressed the Bangladesh and India should not only discuss sharing the 54 common rivers, but also basin-wise management of the trans boundary rivers to utilise the hydroelectric potential in the region as a whole. "All countries in the region have to work together," said the foreign minister. "We are talking about regional grid connectivity. So, a regional approach is necessary for this," she said. Lower riparian country Bangladesh has three big river basinsthe Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. Basins of the three rivers involve India, China, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. According to studies, mountainous Bhutan alone has the potential to produce 28,000 mega watts of hydro electricity. All the three big rivers the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and the Meghna came down to Bangladesh from India. Of the total 54 common rivers, Bangladesh and India could reach agreement on sharing on water of one riverthe Ganges. Experts have been suggesting basin-wise management of the rivers with regional approach. But the countries are yet reach agreement on this issue. The foreign minister criticised the BNP-led government for not doing anything for resolving the water-related disputes with India.
