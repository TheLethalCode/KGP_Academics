<TITLE> Graft, rights abuse main bars to lifting poor: Irene Khan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Irene Khan, former secretary general of Amnesty International, sees corruption and violation of human rights as major obstacles in the fight against poverty in Bangladesh. Khan was speaking at the launch of her book, The Unheard Truth: Poverty and Human Rights, in Dhaka on Thursday. The book argues that poverty cannot be eradicated through economic measures alone but must be viewed from the perspective of human rights and empowerment of the poor. Khan said the new government is doing well but problems still remain, a major one being corruption. She also pointed to a Human Rights Commission that was inactive. She said poverty was a relentless process. "It is struggle for freedom justice and dignity." She pointed out that poverty could not be effectively eradicated unless it was recognised that the existence of poverty was intricately linked with the violation of human rights. "I would not argue with the economists, but growth alone cannot eradicate poverty." She said, economic, social and cultural rights should also be treated as human rights. Khan, who headed the international rights watchdog Amnesty from 2001-09, stressed the need to revitalise the Human Rights Commission, Anticorruption Commission and Information Commission in Bangladesh to redress the erosion of rights. Human rights are something "that must be addressed holistically not selectively, not partially", she added. Speaking as chief guest at the launch finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said that decades ago, there was no place to talk about rights in the poverty discourse. "But now the space is indeed there." Panna Lal, a representative of the Dalit community in Bangladesh, shared his experience of being discriminated in his locality that was indicative of the general trend of discrimination against minorities. Former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan, also a former finance secretary, began with a humourous anecdote of Gopal Bhar who was asked by King Krishna Chandra, the difference between truth and falsehood. The witty Gopal Bhar had replied that the distance was rather slimit was precisely the distance between the king's eyes and ears. Akbar Ali Khan drew the analogy that Irene Khan had written what she had seen and not what she had heard. This former bureaucrat was also the only one to seriously critique the book and pointed out that author had entirely ignored the issue of resource mobilisation. Rehman Sobhan, chairman of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said there was grave injustice behind the exclusion of rights. Right to health, education, work and food for the people should be made mandatory, he added and cited recent examples in India, which he suggested to the finance minister should be replicated in Bangladesh as well. Special guest Fazle Hasan Abed, founder and chairman of BRAC, agreed that empowerment and rights quite rightly constituted crucial elements of poverty eradication. He related how BRAC, itself had learned from its experience on the field and commended Irene Khan on her book saying that the spirit was very much similar to that of BRAC's. Among others, Hossain Zillur Rahman, a former caretaker government adviser, also spoke at the launch held at the BRAC Cetre Inn. Syed Hashemi, director of BRAC's Development Institute, moderated. Irene Khan is currently serving on the BRAC governing board. bd
