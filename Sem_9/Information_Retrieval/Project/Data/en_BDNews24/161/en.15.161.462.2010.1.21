 Dhaka, Jan 21(bdnews24.com) - The government is considering making lists down to union level of collaborators and persons that opposed the war of independence from Pakistan. Answering a written question of Chayan Islam MP, state minister for liberation war affairs ABM Tajul Islam told parliament on Thursday, "The proposal on making lists of collaborators, such as Razakars, Al-Badr, Al-Shams and Shanti Committee members, is under the active consideration by the government." The government will take necessary steps soon after central council elections of Bangladesh Muktijoddha Sangsad, he said. On Wednesday, the prime minister asked the relevant authorities to drop the names of "fake freedom fighters" from the official list of those who fought for freedom. In reply to M Tajul Islam MP from Comilla-9, the minister said the government has undertaken a coordinated programme at Suhrawardi Udyan to immortalise the historic March 7 speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the surrender of Pakistan occupation forces on Dec 16, 1971. A move has been made to construct a museum of international standards, 150-foot high tower, eternal flame, mural of independence and open theatre there, he said. bd
