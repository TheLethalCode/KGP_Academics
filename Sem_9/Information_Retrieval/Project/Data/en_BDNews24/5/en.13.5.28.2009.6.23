 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)-The High Court has ordered installation of effluent treatment plants (ETP) for all industries by June 2010. The court on Tuesday also gave all poison-spewing tanneries in Hazaribagh until Feb 28 2010 to move out of the city center location. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khirul Huq and Mamtazuddin Ahmed gave the orders on separate petitions by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Instructions were also issued to the head of the environment directorate, industries secretary and law-enforcing authorities to implement the order. The court fixed the next date for a hearing on the order on July 31 2010. BELA's petition followed earlier High Court orders from 2001. The environment directorate was asked to ensure installation of treatment plants in 'red' category industries within one year, for protection of the environment. The industry secretary was directed to ensure that no new industry could be set up without effective steps to check environmental pollution. The petitioner sought further High Court orders because of the government's failure to implement any of the directives in the past eight years. The court on April 28 this year ordered the government to report within a month opn what steps were being taken to finally implement the environmental protection orders. BELA was also asked to let the court know about any measures. Supreme Court lawyer Manzil Morshed representing the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, however, filed contempt of court petition on April 28 against the industries secretary and the head of the environment directorate for not taking effective steps to check pollution as ordered. Advocate Rezwana Hasan stood for BELA, deputy attorney general Mostafa Zaman Islam for the government and Manzil Morshed HRPB. bd
