 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - The government once again extended its deadline for appeals to withdraw political harassment cases, a home ministry official said on Wednesday. The deadline has been stretched to July 12 from May 31, senior assistant secretary Mohammad Abdul Baten Miah told bdnews24.com. This is the third extension given by the government since February. Soon after being coming to power in January, the Awami League-led administration announced it would look into cases filed against politicians and others for 'political motives' only. The government invited applications for cancellation of such cases on Feb 22, forming district level vetting committees countrywide and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The central committee has recommended scrapping 108 cases in its two meetings to date62 cases on June 10 and another 46 cases on June 21. Of these, 12 cases were brought against Hasina during the caretaker government. However, no cases against any BNP leader have yet been recommended for withdrawal. bd
