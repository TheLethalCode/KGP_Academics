 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary subcommittee on secondary education is seeking to close loopholes in employment procedures in secondary and higher education and has prepared a report with recommendations. The three-member committee, in its report, proposed an entirely separate directorate for secondary education and made specific recommendations regarding the recruitment of teachers at secondary and higher level. The report says, "It is nearly impossible for the directorate of secondary and higher education to perform its duty properly due to the huge population and increasing number of educational institutions. That is why it is necessary to restructure the directorate and establish a separate administrative body only for secondary education level." The committee also urges that recruitment of teachers be performed through a central administration and that the prevailing rule of recruiting through the managing committee and governing body of non-government educational institutions be ended. Increasingly, managing committees and governing bodies across the country are facing numerous accusations of irregularities and of exhibiting partiality to teaching candidates. The committee took note of allegations that job candidates offer bribes to be assigned employment in the right quarters in the capital and also arrange to work in Dhaka through unethical means and party-favouritism. Consequently, committee members note, only influential people are coming to work in Dhaka and the capital has become 'impossible' for finding employment for job candidates who have no influence. The committee found it was important to transfer government high school and college teachers after they served no more than three years within the same school. It further said changing schools within Dhaka would not be considered a "change of workstation". The report mentioned that there is no post for mentors of the Hindu and Buddhist religions in government secondary schools. The committee feels it is necessary to create those positions among teachers. It also recommended that non-governmental organisations, especially madrasas and others that do not observe national days, be deleted from the Monthly Pay Order list and, if necessary, lose their academic permits. The committee suggested creating MPO listings based upon recommendations of local parliamentarians. The report also suggested effective steps to reduce the lack of discipline and apparent corruption in different units of education-related administrations of the government. It said that transparency and speed cannot be achieved without bringing changes to the administration. It proposed transferring personnel among the inter-education board. An inter-educational board transfer rule, which would be implemented in three years, should be put in place for all educational board officials, the report recommended. The committee said it was important to establish at least one government secondary school in each upazila, or subdistrict, in a bid to ensure quality education. It also proposed the work of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board should be assigned to two separate bodies. The subcommittee, headed by MP Shah Alam along with Kazi Faruk and Sheikh Abdul Ohab, was formed on April 30, 2009. Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education, told bdnews24.com the report would be submitted during the next standing committee meeting. bd
