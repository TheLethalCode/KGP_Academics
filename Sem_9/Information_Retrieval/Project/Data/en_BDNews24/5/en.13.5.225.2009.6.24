<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)New Anticorruption Commission chairman Golam Rahman says the crackdown the graft watchdog carried out under the 2007-2008 caretaker government was right. "The antigraft drive was necessary," Rahman told a press conference on Wednesday after he joined office. Many people thought that they were above the law. But the commission has proved the notion wrong, he said. "Whoever commits corruption will have to get punishment." Asked whether the ACC action was exaggerated in the name of antigraft drive, Rahman said: "Many thought so. But I personally don't think so." A shaking was required at that time, Rahman said. "There will be no compromise with corruption. I will do my job without feeling any pressure. Rahman, however, said the commission will not harass anyone. On the charges against prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition chief Khaleda Zia pressed during the caretaker government, he said: "They got justice in people's court." Many people of the ruling and opposition parties alleged that the ACC drive had harassed them. Asked about the issue, the new chairman said: "It should be proved that they were victim of injustice. The court will prove whether the charges brought against them by the commission is right or wrong." On the withdrawal of corruption cases on the grounds that those were filed for political persecution, Rahman said: "Steps will be taken in line with law. We will consider if any injustice is done to anybody." The recommendations for case withdrawal have come only from the ruling party. He was asked what will be happen to those of the opposition party. "I will consider the cases that will come to me," Rahman said. At the start of the press conference the new chief was introduced to reporters and a briefing on his working experience was given. The government on April 30 appointed Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, as the new chief of the graft watchdog. He succeeded Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury who resigned on personal grounds saying the ACC needed a new leadership to bring swiftness to its work. Rahman, a former Pakistan Civil Service officer who served as commerce secretary and secretary at the prime minister's office, is the third head of the "independent" commission since it was created nearly four and a half years ago. He was made chairman of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission years after he ended his regular civil service career as a secretary. Rahman began his career as a teacher and taught economics at Dhaka University in the late 1960s. bdne
