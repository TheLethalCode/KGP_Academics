<TITLE> Consumer law falls short, but needs fast action: CAB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) The Consumers Association of Bangladesh has called for speedy implementation of the newly passed Consumer Rights Protection Act 2009, but cautioned that the legislation fell short of expectations. A roundtable, organised by CAB on Tuesday, also ended with calls for a commission under the new law. CAB president Borhan Ahmed said legislation required quick execution, being the first attempt at protecting the rights of consumers in Bangladesh. "It certainly needs modification. But swift implementation is the first priority," he said. Ahmed was disappointed that proposals for the establishment of a consumer rights court and exemplary punishment for those caught supplying or selling adulterated products had not been reflected in the act. Prof Mizanur Rahman, from Dhaka University's law department, echoed the criticism. "As it stands, the new law does not allow consumers to take direct legal action against fraudulent or unfair trade practices," he said. "This is the vital flaw of the prevailing act." "Besides, if suppliers of adulterated products are not directly liable for the goods, they remain untouched. Consequently, it is impossible to maintain production standards in the market," said Rahman. He said the legislation was unfairly weighted in favour of retailers, suppliers and producers rather than consumers' interests. The act requires a provision for a national consumer rights protection commission, he said. "We are not completely satisfied with this act. It may suffice as it stands for now, but it needs amendments and fast implementation," said CAB secretary Quazi Faruq in summation. bdnews24.
