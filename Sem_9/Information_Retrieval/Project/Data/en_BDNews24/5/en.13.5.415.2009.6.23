 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League, one of the old parties of the country, is celebrating its 60th founding anniversary on Tuesday with a succession of programmes. This year's anniversary is different as the party swept a landslide victory in the national elections. Party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina paid floral tribute to the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi at around 7am. AL deputy publicity secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil told bdnews24.com Hasina hoisted the national flag while parliament deputy leader and presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury raised the party flag. The prime minister launched the founding anniversary by flying pigeons. Since its birth at Rose Garden of Tikatuli in June 23, 1949, AL has been leading the nation in all the movements against autonomy to independence. Hasina and party general secretary-cum- spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam delivered messages marking the day. In her message, Hasina pledged to stay beside the people like in the past. Ashraful asked all party leaders and activists to observe the day. The programmes of the day include a procession from 'Shikha Chironton' at the Suhrawardy Udyan at 2pm and cultural function in the evening at Paltan Maidan. A central team of the party led by presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim will offer tribute at the grave of Bangabandhu at Tungipara in Gopalganj. The party will organise a meeting at 2pm on Wednesday, to be attended by Hasina as chief guest. Since its birth, the AL quickly gained widespread support throughout the then East Pakistan. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani was the founding president of the party with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman initially occupying the post of joint secretary. Later, in 1952, Mujib assumed the position of acting general secretary before becoming general secretary of the party the following year. He remained at the helm for 13 years. Established as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan, the AL soon became associated with the principles of secularism and Bengali nationalism. Having formed a coalition government in 1954, the party championed the Bengali language movement in 1952 while decrying overt discrimination between the two Pakistani provinces. The party gained a healthy majority in the historical election of 1970, however this was not acceptable to the political establishment of West Pakistan and the bloody events of the independence war soon erupted in the troubled region. Sheikh Mujib declared an independent Bangladesh just before he was arrested and taken to jail in Pakistan. Later, other party leaders formed an interim government on April 17. Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and his family members in 1975, his daughter Sheikh Hasina, who survived the attack while abroad, returned home in 1981 and took over the reins of the party. The Awami League has formed government three times since the birth of the nation. bdnews2
