 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said Tuesday that the full text of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's March 7 speech is to be included in secondary school textbooks from the next session. "Mujibur's declaration of independence, according to the constitution, and some other new writings are also to be included in the books," Nahid told a press conference after receiving the recommendations of a committee tasked to settle the secondary school syllabus. His remarks came also in the wake of a landmark High Court ruling that said Mujib, not Zia Rahman, proclaimed the country's independence and any alternate version of the proclamation should be erased from history and textbooks. "We have to entirely revise the textbooks to provide a world class education, and it warrants more time," said Nahid. "As a matter of urgency, we have decided to print new textbooks for the upcoming session containing accurate accounts of the Bangladesh Liberation War," he said. Committee chairperson Momtajuddin Ahmed said: "We were on the wrong track. The father of the nation and the history of Bangladesh were presented in a distorted way." "We have recommended the inclusion of the March 7 speech of Bangabandhu in Bengali literature books for class eight. The declaration of independence, according to the constitution, will be included in social science books," said Momtajuddin. Elaborating on the changes, committee member Prof Ratan Siddiqi said some new textbooks would replace others in the syllabus for students of classes six to nine. These include, 'Rokte Lekha Muktijuddher Golpo' (Stories of the Liberation War Written in Blood), while 'Charupath' will be replaced by committee recommended 'Ekjon Muktijoddhar Chithi' (Letter of a Freedom Fighter). In the book Anandopath for class seven, we suggest replacing Ibrahim Khan's 'Bhanga Kulor Golpo' (Story of a Broken Winnowing Fan) with Ronesh Dasgupta's 'Mallyadan' (To Garland), said Prof Ratan. The nine-member committee was formed on April 30 to look into accounts of the Liberation War in secondary level textbooks. bdnews2
