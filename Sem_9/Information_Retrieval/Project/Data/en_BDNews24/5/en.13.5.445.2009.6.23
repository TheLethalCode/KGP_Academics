 Chittagong, June 23 (bdnews24.com) - A Dutch ship lost control coming in to berth at Chittagong port on Tuesday, ramming into a jetty and causing major structural damage, a port official said. The steel-laden ship, MV Kent Legislation, hit Jetty-8 at around 1:30pm, port secretary Mohammad Farhad Uddin said. There were no casualties, he said. "But the front part of the jetty received a 40-foot deep fracture. The ship also suffered damaged.". Loading and offloading had been suspended at the jetty, he said. A three-member committee, led by harbour master Zafar Ullah, has been formed to probe the accident, the port official said. bdnews2
