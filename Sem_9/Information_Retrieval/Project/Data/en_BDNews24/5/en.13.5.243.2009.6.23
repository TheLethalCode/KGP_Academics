 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Shuktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj clinched the Bashundhara Champions Club Cup with a solitary goal win over 10-man Feni Soccer Club in the final at Cox's Bazar on Tuesday. Sohel struck the decider in the third minute in front of a nearly 2,000-strong crowd and it was enough to bring the inaugural Champions Club Cup trophy home. Feni Soccer Club clearly dominated the game, but could not split the backline of Shuktra, who apparently adopted a defensive strategy after taking the early lead. Taking advantage of some sloppy work by the defenders, Khokon advanced into the danger zone to drive a shot, but saw goalkeeper Nehal foil his effort. However, Sohel did not waste to send the follow-up home with a well-judged header in the third minute. Feni Soccer Club studded with three players, who were picked for the provisional squad of the national team, pressed hard, but failed to break the solid defence of Narayanganj outfit. Moreover, Feni Soccer Club were reduced to 10 men in the 73rd minute when striker Nasir picked up a second yellow card. Shuktara Jubo Sangsad came close to doubling the margin from a counter attack in the 84th minute when Arafat dodging past an opponent defender and hammered a shot that beat goalkeeper Nehal but it narrowly missed the target. Shuktata Jubo Sangsad also earned a ticket to the professional football league from this season, but it depends on meeting some conditions of the B. League. bd
