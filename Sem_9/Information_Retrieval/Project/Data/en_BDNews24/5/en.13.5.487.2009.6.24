<TITLE> Daniel Craig eyes psychological thriller </TITLE>

 NEW YORK, Wed Jun 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniel Craig can shake, but can he stir? The latest James Bond has proved a critical and commercial success in his two turns in the iconic role, for "Casino Royale" and "Quantum of Solace." But he has been deliberate in choosing his next live-action role. Now comes word he is in early talks to star in "Dream House," a psychological thriller to be directed by Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan for indie producer Morgan Creek, though principals stress that the two sides have not reached a deal. In the David Loucka script, Craig would play a man who moves his family to an idyllic small town, only to find his house haunted by its former inhabitants, who were murdered there. With a pedigreed director like Sheridan ("In America," "My Left Foot"), the movie would accomplish the goal of branching Craig out into a more prestige direction post-"Quantum" while keeping him in the realm of the commercial. Like other Bond actors, Craig has faced a crossroads coming off Bond hits. His two other roles, "Munich" and "Defiance," saw him essentially take on a more art house version of the Bond character of hit man and vigilante. Craig already has shown interest in more boutique fare, recently signing for the Broadway drama "A Steady Rain." His name also surfaced in connection with "The Eagle of the Ninth," Kevin Macdonald's period pic for Focus Feat
