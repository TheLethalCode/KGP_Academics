 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)The Rapid Action Battalion have arrested one of the city's 'top criminals' Sohrab Hossain Shahin, commonly known as 'Major' Shahin. "Shahin's brother Shamim was a gang leader in the Mirpur area. Shahin was part of that gang," said RAB-1assistant director Kazi Muttaki Ibnu Minan. "Shamim was killed back in 1997/98 in an encounter with a rival group. Shahin took charge of the gang after the death of his brother." RAB said Shahin was involved in contract killing, extortion and the lucrative Jhut (rag) trade. He is facing 16 cases, including four charges of murder, said RAB. RAB also arrested two associates, seizing Shahin's car, a Chinese-made handgun, four bullets and three bottles of phensidyl, said Minan.
