<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith has hit back at the critics of the offer in the budget to legalise black money, saying many of them had legalised their undisclosed income before. "Those who are now criticising the proposal had whitened their black money at different times in the past," the minister told reporters on Wednesday after a meeting with the delegation of Telecommunication Infrastructure Operator of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Cold Storage Association at the Secretariat. "Where were the people who are now worried about ethics when the scope was given in the past?" On whether the proposal would be kept, the minister said that was a matter of his individual decision. "When the budget is placed it reflects the individual view of the finance minister. But the budget is not passed with that individual decision." The cabinet gives the final decision, he said. Muhith said the money whitening provision had been given since 1976 and it is ongoing over the years. The minister conceded that the offer did not see significant amount of money whitened. This time the government considered the provision to boost investment in the public private partnership initiative, the minister said. bdnew
