<TITLE> H'jheel project: BGMEA Bhaban stays </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June23 (bdnews24.com)  The capital's Hatirjheel-Begunbari project will be completed on time leaving the BGMEA Bhaban intact, housing and public works minister Abdul Mannan Khan said Tuesday. The planned city centre development, to reclaim a major water body from encroachment, has seen ballooning costs and confusion over the future of the BGMEA Bhaban, standing mid-site on what was the Begunbari canal. Khan said the integrated development project--which includes five new flyovers, bridges, parks, roads and lakes--would be fully realised by the June 2010 deadline. The government will provide alternative housing for all those displaced by the project, said Khan following a meeting with the steering committee for the project. "Those displaced will be allocated housing in four or five multi-storey buildings adjacent to the project on public land," said Khan. The minister said funds for the housing would be redirected from the current allocation for the project, although the details were still being worked out. The 300-acre site, adjacent to the Sonargaon Hotel and stretching back to Rampura, had until recently become a haven for encroachers that included property developers as well as thousands of slum dwellers. The move to re-develop Hatirjheel-Begunbari was taken during the past caretaker government as an environmental measure to recover the area from decades of encroachment. The past government had said all structures in the area, legal and illegal, would be cleared without exception. The project, initiated in 2007, aims to preserve rainwater and eliminate water logging in the area, and to ease traffic gridlock by creating another east-west route in the city. Army engineers began the work of clearing the land for the project with a cost initially estimated at Tk 1000 crore. It was later revised to Tk 1,480 crore. bdnews24.
