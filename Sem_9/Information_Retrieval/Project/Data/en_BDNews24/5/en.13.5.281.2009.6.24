<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain said Wednesday completion of the Padma bridge at Mawa, 50 km south of Dhaka, may not be possible within the tenure of the current administration. He said the project would be delayed if tenders for construction work had to wait until after loan agreements have been secured with donors. However, tenders will initially be invited for feasibility studies before the loan agreements are signed. The government is currently negotiating with donors regarding this, said Hossain following a farewell meeting with departing World Bank country director Xian Zhu. Hossain said Zhu had assured him of continued support from the multi-lateral lending agency in various development projects including the Padma bridge project and railway development. The World Bank assured their assistance in developing new rail lines, launching new services and incorporating computer automation in the railway system, said the minister. bdne
