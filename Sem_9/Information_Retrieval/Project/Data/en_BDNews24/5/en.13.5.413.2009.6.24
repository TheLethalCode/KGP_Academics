 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  The batsmen of the West Indies-bound Bangladesh national team had a tough time on the first day of the lone two-day warm-up match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. The BCB Red, captained by Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, were struggling at 79-7 at the close of play after Shakib Al Hasan's BCB Greens were skittled out for a paltry 188 in 48.2 overs thanks to a superb six-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Jr. After being put in to bat, openers Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique gave BCB Green nearly a steady start before Bangladesh's new captain Mashrafe drew first blood for his side removing Tamim for 17, leaving the opponents at 37-1 in 8.3. Junaed and Roqibul Hasan took their side to 71 before Enamul struck first to have Junaed (27) caught by Mehrab to start his devastating spin web that also saw Shakib Al Hasan (14), Mahmudullah Riad (10), Mushfiqur Rahim (0) and Shahadat Hossain (14) removed in a row. Then Mohammad Ashraful dismissed Mahbubul Alam Robin (2) and Nazmul Hossain (7) with his leg-spin and BCB Green slumped to 188 all out. Abdur Razzak who was not considered for the national side due to his long absence in the international area, however, was 25 not out and later picked up three wickets for 23 runs. In reply, BCB Red lost opener Imrul Kayes off Shahadat Hossain's very first delivery and Nazmul Hossain dismissed Shamsur Rahman for 24 to reduce Mashrafe's side to 36-2 in 12.2 overs. Mehrab Hossain Jr made 23 before being stumped by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur off a Riad delivery, leaving the side at 57-3. After being sacked from the captaincy on Tuesday, there was an obvious impact on batting as the outgoing captain Ashraful made just two off seven deliveries before being trapped in front by Shakib. Afterwards, Razzak removed Naeem Islam (1), Mashrafe (9) and Enamul (0) in a row to reduce BCB Red to 74-7 and Shahagir Hossain and Ruble Hossain were batting on 16 and nought when the bails were drawn. bd
