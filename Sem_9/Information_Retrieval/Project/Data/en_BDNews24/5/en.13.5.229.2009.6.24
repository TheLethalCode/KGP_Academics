 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque secured bail on Wednesday after turning himself in to a Dhaka court being charged with not submitting his wealth information to the Anticorruption Commission. He turned himself in, eight years after the case was lodged, before Dhaka divisional judge Golam Murtaza Majumdar. In May 26, 1999 the then Anticorruption Bureau asked Farroque to submit his assets statement. He received that notice at July 9 of that year but did not provide information within 45 days. On Jan 28, 2000, the Anticorruption Bureau filed a case against him at Mirpur Police Station. He received bail from Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court on June 26, 2001 but did not appear In court later. On Jan 11, 2002, the court issued an arrest warrant against him. Farroque's lawyers Mahbub Uddin Khokon and Sanaullah Miah said he had not been informed of the state of the case, which was why he did not appear in court on scheduled dates. Another lawyer, Taherul Islam, said there were seven cases against Farroque and he secured bail in all the cases from the lower court. bdnew
