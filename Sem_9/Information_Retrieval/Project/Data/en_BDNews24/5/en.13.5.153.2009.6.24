 ISLAMABAD, Wed Jun 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court dismissed on Wednesday an appeal by Sarabjit Singh, an Indian man seeking a review of a death sentence imposed on him for spying and carrying out bombings in the 1990s. The rejection came as relations between old rivals India and Pakistan inched towards improvement following a meeting last week between their leaders, the first since last year's militant attack on Mumbai in which 166 people were killed. Singh was sentenced to death in 1991 for spying and bombings that killed 14 people. His family said he was innocent and had crossed the border into Pakistan accidentally in 1990 while he was drunk.

India says Pakistan-based militants were involved in the assault but Pakistan denies any state agencies were involved.

Senior officials from the two countries are due to hold further talks to exchange information on terrorism soon, while political leaders are expected to meet in
