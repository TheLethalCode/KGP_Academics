 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Long awaited rain was seen amid the scorching heat of the capital on Wednesday, but it turned out to be barely a drizzle. The Met office said the heat wave abated temporarily with the light shower and cloud cover. There was some rain in the city's Dhanmondi, Mirpur, Shahbagh and Gulistan areas among others. In the rest of the country, Dinajpur, Syedpur, Mymensingh, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chandpur, Feni, Srimangal and Sylhet saw some showers. But the met office said the heat of past weeks is abnormal as there has been so little rainfall for the time of year. "Heat waves over Khulna, Rajshahi, Ishwardi, Tangail and Jessore, look likely to persist for the next three or four days," meteorologist Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. The weather office said the monsoon winds remained very weak over the Bay of Bengal compared to normal activity at this time of year. "Analysing rainfall data of the last 30 years, we can see that there will be less rainfall this June but it may still remain within normal levels," said BUET professor Dr Nazrul Islam, also an official of the Saarc weather research centre. "There was little rainfall in April too, but more is expected in August and October," he said. Monsoon winds picked up in advance this year with Cyclone Aila in May. But they died down again in its wake, say meteorologists. bdnews24.
