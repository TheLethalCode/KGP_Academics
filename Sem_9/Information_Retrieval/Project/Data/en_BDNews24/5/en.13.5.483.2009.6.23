 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Channel One was back on air on Tuesday afternoon, 21 hours after it stopped transmission after the private television station promised to pay five months' fees for the satellite transponder. The channel resumed its transmission after SingTel, the owner of the satellite that beams its programmes, restored the link around 2.30pm local time, a SingTel official in Dhaka said. The SingTel official told bdnews24.com that the station committed to clear one and a half months of fees by June 29 and another three months 'as soon as possible'. The official warned that failure to pay in time would result in stoppage of transmission again. A One official on Monday claimed that transmission had stopped at around 5pm "due to technical reasons". But a SingTel representative said the station defaulted on payments to the tune of US$ 106,000, fees accumulated since Jan 15. Channel One general manager Abul Kashem told bdnews24.com on Monday: "Transmission is suspended temporarily. We have been trying to contact the SingTel authorities in Singapore. We hope we'll be back on air soon." Channel One rented the transponder space for US$ 21,200 a month and has not paid SingTel, the satellite owner, since Jan 15 this year. "It has happened before and we have always tried to help them (Channel One)," a SingTel official in Dhaka said, requesting anonymity. bdnew
