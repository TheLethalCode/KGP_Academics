 MEXICO CITY, Tue Jun 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Andres, the first cyclone of the eastern Pacific season, pounded western Mexico on Tuesday after sweeping a fisherman to his death and flooding streets in Acapulco. Andres blew into a category one hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph, coming close to Mexico's Pacific coast before easing in strength and turning northwest, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm, which was around 110 miles west of the port and resort town of Manzanillo, was downgraded back to a tropical storm. "Some additional weakening is forecast during the next 24 hours," the NHC said. The ports of Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Lazaro Cardenas were all closed as the storm created huge waves. No major tourist resorts were in immediate danger, however, and Mexico has no oil drilling platforms in the Pacific. On Monday, Andres caused heavy rains that flooded parts of Acapulco, and a man in his mid-thirties was swept away to his death by a wave as he stood waist-deep in the sea in a nearby town fishing with a line. "He was dragged away," said an emergency services spokesman for the surrounding state of Guerrero. A tropical storm warning was in place for the stretch of coast between Manzanillo and Cabo Corrie
