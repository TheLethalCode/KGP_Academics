<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has urged MPs not to create a situation that would lead to return of an unconstitutional government in future. She made the appeal while delivering her speech on the proposed national budget for FY 2009-10 in parliament. Another Awami League MP Dhirendra Chandra Devnath told parliament that all pervasive corruption had crossed all previous record. "During the last two years, extra-constitutional events took place. The present government also inherited some of the unconstitutional actions. "Some say these should be validated through the doctrine of necessity. It reminds us of the infamous doctrine of necessity invoked by military ruler Ayub Khan (of Pakistan). "We should not forget that Bangladesh emerged as an independent nation opposing the infamous doctrine of necessity," Dipu Moni said. "I urge the parliament (to make sure that no) unconstitutional events take place in future". The foreign minister also opposed the 'black money' whitening offer for three years as proposed by the finance minister. She proposed that the black money holders should be punished to some extent and given last chance to legalise illegally unearned undisclosed money. Dhirendra Devnath said the corruption had not come down, rather it spread into 'lanes and alleys'. "Corruption has increased. It had crossed all previous records. "We have to curb corruption," Devnath said. Waresat Hossain Belal, Jafor Iqbal Siddiqui, Abdul Hai, Mollah Jalal Uddin, Mamtaz Begum and Faridunnahar Laily also spoke on the proposed national budget. bd
