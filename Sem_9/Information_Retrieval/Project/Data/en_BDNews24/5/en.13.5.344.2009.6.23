<TEXT>
 Dhaka June 23 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday ordered all tanneries located in Hazaribagh to vacate the area by Feb 28 2010, and ensure all such factories are fitted with effluent treatment plants by June the same year. The ruling follows a writ petition by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association and Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, an NGO. It follows an earlier HC order from 2001 that directed all Hazaribagh tanneries to relocate out of the city centre to Savar. Justices ABM Khairul Huq and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave Tuesday's ruling. bdnews2
