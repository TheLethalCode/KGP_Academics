 JAMMU, India, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 25 people were killed when an overcrowded bus veered off a mountain road in Indian Kashmir and fell down a deep gorge into a stream, officials said on Wednesday. The driver lost control of the bus carrying office workers near Panthal, 55 km from Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir state. Rescuers who struggled with rocky terrain were shifting the 43 passengers injured in the crash to nearby hospitals. "The driver lost control of the bus and rolled down about 250 feet deep gorge into a stream near Panthal this morning," Sanjeev Verma, deputy commissioner of Reasi district, told Reuters by phone. Buses in Kashmir are often overcrowded and accidents on narrow mountainous roads are common.
