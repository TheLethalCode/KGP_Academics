 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has assigned a subcommittee to investigate further alleged irregularities by former shipping adviser M A Matin. The parliamentary standing committee on shipping said Matin "unilaterally" raised the retirement-age for Chittagong Port Authority pilots from 57 to 60. "This is a violation of the government rule. He alone cannot change the retirement age of public servants," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, the committee chairman, told reporters after a meeting. "It requires an investigation. Therefore, we have tasked the probe body to investigate this too," said Chowdhury. Matin, who had also headed a corruption busting national taskforce formed by the past caretaker government, did not seek approval from the finance and establishment ministries before he made his unilateral decision on Nov 9, 2008, according to the document presented at the committee meeting. Raising the age-limit of government officials involved additional spending from the public exchequer and needed approval from the finance and other ministries concerned, shipping ministry officials said at the meeting. The standing committee formed the subcommittee in May, headed by ruling party lawmaker Mohammad Shah Alam, to investigate alleged irregularities of the adviser in the award of a container handling deal, at Chittagong port, to a private firm in his last 24 hours in office. The standing committee earlier this month decided to summon the adviser to hear his version. bd
