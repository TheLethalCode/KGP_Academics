 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has judged former vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, Emajuddin Ahmed, as being in contempt of court after he spoke against its verdict regarding the proclamation of independence. The High Court on June 21 ruled that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and not Ziaur Rahman, was the declarer of Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971. The next day, Emajuddin said that High Court was running "a malign campaign". The court on Wednesday ordered him to appear on July 2 to answer in person why punitive measures should not be taken against him for speaking against the court and its verdict. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave the order on a petition by freedom fighter Dr MA Salam, who also filed the original public interest petition on which the proclamation verdict was given. Advocate Manjil Morshed appealed on behalf of the petitioner. bdn
