<TITLE> HC judgement will bond the nation, not divide: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said the historic High Court verdict that declared that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, not Ziaur Rahman, had proclaimed independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan will unite the nation more than ever. "Those who are saying that the nation will be divided over the verdict are waiting to distort the history," he told reporters at his office on Tuesday. His comments came a day after retired wing commander Bir Pratik M Hamidullah Khan, a defendant in the public interest petition, who had said that the judgement would divide the nation. Khan, who had fought the independence war as commander of sector 11, contested the verdict in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The judgement was given on a public interest petition by freedom fighter Dr MA Salam on Apr 19. Later, Sector Commanders Forum and Hamidullah Khan were included in the petition. "Some newspapers have published disparaging remarks about the High Court judges which are tantamount to contempt of court," said Shafique, a barrister and former president of Supreme Court Bar Association, apex lawyers' body. "BNP's former law minister Moudud Ahmed mentioned Sheikh Mujib as the 'declarer' of independence in his book 'Sheikh Mujiber Shashonkal' (The rule of Sheikh Mujib) and now he is giving intentional speeches. This is unacceptable." Shafique said that the High Court referred to the book to support its verdict. He also said that the High Court judgement that declared the fifth amendment to the constitution and subsequent 1975 military takeover as illegal was also historic. "The main base of democracy is a secular social system. Now the constitution of 1972 will be established in the country once again." A two-judge bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mamotaz Uddin Ahmed on Sunday also ordered the annulment of the third volume of Bangladesher Swadhinata Juddho Dalilpatra (Bangladesh Liberation War Documents) that presents Ziaur Rahman, a major in the Pakistan army at the time, as the "declarer of independence". The High Court banned the publication, sale, distribution and printing of the volume, and ordered its withdrawal and confiscation at home and abroad. It also directed the government to ensure the "true history" of independence was written in textbooks. bdne
