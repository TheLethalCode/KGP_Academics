 Narayanganj, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Transport owners and workers association observed a six-hour strike in Narayanganj on Wednesday in protest at the incident of vandalising vehicles allegedly by the supporters of MP Sarah Begum Kabari the previous day. Narayanganj District Bus-Minibus Owners-Workers' Association called for the strike that started on 6am. Transport movement became normal after the midday. Students and office-goers faced trouble as vehicles stayed off Dhaka-Narayanganj route. Around 12 buses of Kabari's fleet were rampaged at Chasharah on Tuesday when they were going to Dhaka to attend the 60th anniversary programmes of Awami League. "They (supporters of Kabari) took 13 vehicles from us. When they wanted more the owners demanded fare. The supporters became angry and damaged vehicles," said Muktar Hossain, president of the association and chairman of Ananda Paribahan. Kabari said a particular family that wanted to rule Narayanganj through terrorism had carried out the attack. But transport owners said the rampage was done at her orders. The association held a protest meeting at the central bus terminal of the town on Tuesday afternoon and urged the authorities to take steps against those involved. bdnews
