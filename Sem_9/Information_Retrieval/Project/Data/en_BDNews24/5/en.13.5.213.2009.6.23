<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  After being appointed captain of the national cricket team on Tuesday for the series against West Indies and Zimbabwe, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza has emphasised the need to improve the level of mental confidence. "We need to improve the team's mental confidence as it seemed to me during the last Twenty20 match against Ireland that we could not make runs under pressure. I think we could have made more runs against any other big team in that situation what happened against a low team like as Ireland," said Mashrafee in his reaction. "It is a big honour to get the captaincy of a national team and I feel pretty good after being appointed the captain of the Bangladesh cricket team," said the 25-year-old pacer. Mashrafee is the 15th captain of Bangladesh as well as the first-ever among pace bowers and he wants to avail the opportunity utilising his experience. "I don't have so much experience of captaincy though I have just guided Abahani in the domestic league. Besides, I had also no such ideal captain to follow, but I want to utilise my eight-year playing experience while leading Bangladesh," said the pace spearhead. Knowing it very well that the captain as well as the coach are responsible for the failure of the team, Mashrafee said, "Yes, it is a difficult time, but I hope everything will go in the right direction." Mashrafee believes things had changed more after losing to Ireland though Bangladesh put up fighting spirit against better sides in the World Twenty20. "I don't think the matter of losing to Ireland will affect the players much and I believe they will return back to the position where they are supposed to be if they get the mental support." Mashrafee also hoped for better performances against West Indies and Zimbabwe in his first assignment. "I want to take it one-by-one and the focus is now on the West Indies tour and if we can play some good matches against West Indies, then it will help us against Zimbabwe." The captain also praised the leadership of the previous skipper saying: "A few tours were really good under Ashraful's captaincy. We played some close matches against good sides. I also learnt something from him and definitely it will help us in future." "I said it before that Ashraful is something different for Bangladesh. See what happens when Sachin Tendulkar is in the Indian side, many of them get inspired and Ashraful is also like Tendulkar," Mashrafee said. "If he is not in the squad, many of us feel bad, even lose their confidence. Ashraful is such a cricketer who suits every format of cricket." Ashraful congratulated the new captain and vice-captain and hoped they did well in the West Indies. "I have come here to congratulate Mashrafee and Shakib as the captain and the vice-captain of the national team and I hope we will play fine cricket in the West Indies though we could not play well in the World Twenty20. "Mashrafee and I together played under-17-level cricket in 2000 and since then we are good friends. Besides, he guided Abahani to clinch premier cricket league and it is a positive step for him. I will extend my support to him as much as possible." said Ashraful. Vice-captain Shakib Al Hasan saw nothing new in the new responsibility as he was also a member of the team's five-player leadership group. bd
