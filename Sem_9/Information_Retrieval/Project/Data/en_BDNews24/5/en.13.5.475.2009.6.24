 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Intelligence failure led to the assassination of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the four national leaders in 1975, the August 21 grenade attack on Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina and the BDR carnage, the home minister has said. "It is being investigated to see whose negligence it was and then steps will be taken against those responsible," she told reporters at her office after the third meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order on Wednesday. Steps are being taken to modernise the agencies to avert a repeat of such failure, she added. Sahara said 40 cases had been filed at the districts and one in Dhaka over the mutiny by border guards at their Peelkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26. The cabinet meeting discussed quick disposal of the cases and exemplary punishment against those responsible, the minister added. She alleged that the 2001-2006 BNP-led government had reared militant groups and terrorists. "The situation improved after present government took over. But we are not satisfied yet. We are trying to improve the situation further." Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, law minister Shafiq Ahmed, information minister Abul Kalam Azad, state minister for liberation war affairs AB Tajul Islam, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, RAB director general Khandakar Mahmud Hasan, BDR director general Major General Mainul Islam, the Ansar-VDP director general and representatives of the National Security Intelligence, Armed Forces Division, Army Headquarters and Coast Guards were present in the meeting. bdnews24.
