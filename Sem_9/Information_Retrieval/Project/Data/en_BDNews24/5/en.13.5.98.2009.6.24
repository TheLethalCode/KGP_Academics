 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Moudud Ahmed on Wednesday alleged that it was Awami League that created debate about the declaration of independence. He claimed that Ziaur Rahman made the declaration of independence on March 27, 1971 being self-motivated. Later, he made another on behalf of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 30 as the local Awami League leaders requested him. Moudud said law minister Shafiq Ahmed on Tuesday lied without going through his book. In the book 'Bangladesh: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman-er Shashonamol' (Bangladesh: Reign of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman), he said he did not write anything about the declaration of independence. "But he said that I named him as the proclaimer of independence. The information is not correct," he told reporters at his Motijheel chamber. He has been briefing reporters at his chamber since he stepped out of jail on bail in several cases. He said preparations for filing a case against the former army chief Moeen U Ahmed was underway, but would not to disclose the details. The High Court on June 21 gave the judgment that Sheikh Mujib, not Ziaur Rahman, proclaimed independence on a public interest petition by freedom fighter M A Salam on April 19. The verdict had also said those who were involved in such distortion of history have violated the constitution and the government could take punitive measures against them. The third volume of Bangladesher Swadhinata Juddho Dalilpatra (Bangladesh Liberation War Documents) printed in during the term of the 2001-2006 BNP-led coalition government which described Ziaur Rahman as the 'declarer' of independence. The High Court directed the government to include true history in textbooks at all level. bd
