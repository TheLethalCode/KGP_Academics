 Brahmanbaria, June 24 (bdnews24.com)The Brahmanbaria Muktijoddha Sangsad, a freedom fighters' forum, has vowed to resist a rally scheduled to be addressed on Wednesday by Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Quader Molla, an alleged war criminal. Jamaat called for a workers' rally at Nabinagar Sadar Upazila in the district where Quader Molla was supposed to be the chief guest. "We will resist Quader Molla at any rate," former Muktijoddha Sangsad commander Shamsul Alam said. The upazila administration has imposed section 144 for 24 hours to avert any untoward incident as both Jamaat and Muktijoddha Sangsad called for rallies at Bara Bazar at 10am. "We have imposed section 144 from 9am Wednesday to 9am Thursday to avert any unpleasant situation," Nabinagar Upazila Nirbahi officer Faridul Islam told bdnews24.com.
