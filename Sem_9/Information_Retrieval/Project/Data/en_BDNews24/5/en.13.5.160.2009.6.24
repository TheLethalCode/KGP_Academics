<TITLE> No hasty decision on open-pit mining: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka ,June 23 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister's energy adviser Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury said Tuesday any decision to pursue open-pit coal mining in the country would only be made following expert recommendations. "We will consider expert opinions, and will only make a decision that benefits the people," he said at a programme of the seventh anniversary of the publication Energy & Power. "A decision will be taken considering economic, social, commercial and environmental factors relevant to the mining area," said Chowdhury. He said recent increases in load-shedding, particularly at night, are a result of the ongoing heat wave combined with existing limitations with the distribution system. But, he said, the situation will improve after some rainfall. FBCCI president Annisul Huq complained that the more seminars he attended, the more confused he became, saying: "Eventually we wonder where we are going and whose speech is authentic." "The whole world is generating power out of coal. So why not us? We have coal resources which we can utilise for power generation," said the president of the country's apex business body. Annisul went on to say that the government had won a five-year mandate and should now take a lead in the matter: "The country now expects action from the government; its honeymoon period is over." Nepal experiences 18 hours of load-shedding a day, while Bhutan meets their power demands by importing from India, added the FBCCI chief. Dhaka University professor Hossain Monsur, who opposed open-pit coal exploration during the four party alliance's tenure, made an apparent about turn at the meeting, claiming there was now no alternative to coal exploration. "The government should go for self-funded open-pit coal exploration in Barpukuria immediately," said Monsur. bdnews24.co
