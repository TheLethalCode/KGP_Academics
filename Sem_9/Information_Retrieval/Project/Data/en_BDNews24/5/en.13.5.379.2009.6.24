<TITLE> PPR changes not a sop to party faithful: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith said Tuesday that changes to the public procurement regulations were to ensure "dynamism, transparency and accountability" in development programmes, and not to benefit those loyal to the party. The new draft regulations had been finalised and reviewed by the cabinet, Muhith told reporters after a meeting with outgoing World Bank country director Xian Zhu at the Economic Relations Division. He said the draft was likely to get final approval at the next cabinet meeting. Muhith said changes to the regulations aimed to secure qualified contractors and create opportunity for new entrepreneurs. "In the past, contractors who provided low quotes often disappeared with the money without completing half the work," he said. Muhith said fifty percent of rural development work was marked by "irregularities". "As a result, the government has been incurring huge losses." He said the PPR was being revised to stop the drain on public money. He also stressed that the World Bank or other donor agencies had not pressured the government in any way over regulations, but they did monitor procedures with regard to funding development projects. bdnews24.co
