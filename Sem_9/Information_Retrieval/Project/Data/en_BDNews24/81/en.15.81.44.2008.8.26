 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  Two early strikes on Tuesday from Nigerian Alamu Bukola Olaleken took Mohammedan SC to the semifinals of the Citycell Federation Cup with a 2-0 win over Muktijoddha Sangsad KS at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Striker Olalenken, who struck a hat-trick in the group final match, gave Mohammedan the lead in the eighth minute and doubled it in the 21st minute. The Black-and-Whites will face the winners between Chittagong Mohammedan and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan in the second semifinal on Aug 30. The national league champions, Mohammedan started with great pace and their early pressure almost yielded a goal in the fourth minute when Nasir whipped in a well-judged cross from the right for Bukola, whose side-volley to the near post went narrowly wide. However, the Motijheel-based outfit did not have to wait long for a deserved lead and went ahead in the eighth minute. Sharif released Mohammad Robin with a neat pass, who from the right fed Bukola and the lanky striker had no hesitation to tap the cross home. Mohammedan doubled the lead midway in the first half as Bukola struck his tournament's seventh goal in three matches. Egyptian medio Hazem Khaled Mahmoud nutmegged Muktis defender Rony inside the danger zone to set up Bukola, who calmly drove the ball past goalkeeper Nizam Majumder. Muktijoddha Sangsad tried to come back in the game and created a clear chance when Nwakanma Ikedinachi darted in to chase a pass on the edge of the box. But with Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Haq at his mercy, his overhead kick drifted wide, much to frustration of the All Reds. The freedom fighters' team stepped up the attack and had at least four chances inside seven minutes but all of them were wasted as Mohammedan failed to control the midfield after the breather. Mohammedan, however, came close to scoring a third in the 72nd minute, but Nizam denied Komol. Muktijoddha's best chance to reduce the margin came in the 88th minute when substitute Tajul Khan ran past three Mohammedan defenders to flick the ball, but onrushing keeper Aminul managed to tip the ball away for a corner. It was again Aminul who parried a close-range shot from Ikedinachi for a corner just a minute from time help Mohammedan soak up the late pressure from Muktijoddha. b
