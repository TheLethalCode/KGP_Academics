 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cuba's Angel Valodia Matos kicked the match referee in the head in his bronze medal bout against Kazakhstan's Arman Chilmanov as Saturday's Olympic men's heavyweight taekwondo tournament descended into chaos. With the Cuban leading 3-2 in the second period, coaches from both teams ran on to the mat to remonstrate with the match referee after he stopped the fight, apparently in Chilmanov's favour.

Matos was promptly disqualified and escorted from the arena
