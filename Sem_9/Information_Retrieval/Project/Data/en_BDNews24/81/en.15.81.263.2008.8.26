 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  The political parties will have to register by the Oct 15 deadline if they wish to run the December parliamentary elections, the chief election commissioner has said. "Registration is a must for the participation in the elections. The EC will deal only with the parties that get registered," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after inaugurating the First Dhaka Inter-School Debate contest at Saint Gregory's High School. "If not registered, it will not be possible on our part to work with some 150 political parties," he said. The Election Commission on Monday ordered political parties to apply for registration from Aug 27 to Oct 15 for general elections, a must under new electoral laws, and said it wanted to be through with the registration procedure by Oct 30. It Tuesday formally asked the political parties to register by publishing a gazette of political parties' registration 2008, signed by EC secretary Humayun Kabir. The political parties have been asked to give names and address of party headquarters, copies of party constitution and electoral agenda. The political parties have accepted the conditions for registration, the CEC said. "The parties are now prioritising registration though they had opposed it earlier." "This is a good achievement for us," he said. On the allegations of the parties that timeframe was too short, Huda said: "We will discuss it with the parties, listen to their suggestions and try to resolve the problems. But they must register by Oct 15." According to the new laws, a party that has won at least one constituency in parliamentary elections since independence or secured five percent of total votes in the constituencies contested can apply for registration. The parties seeking to be registered must have committee in at least 10 districts and 50 upazilas. All committees must be elected, with a target of getting 33 percent women leaders in all committees by 2020. Besides, every political party must have a constitution, the fresh electoral laws enforced last week stipulate. bdnew
