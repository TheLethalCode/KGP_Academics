 BRISBANE, Australia, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening batsman Matthew Hayden has been ruled out of Australia's one-day series against Bangladesh starting in Darwin on Saturday to recover fully from an Achilles injury. Cricket Australia's medical staff opted to leave the veteran batsman out of the series to spare him the three-and-a-half hour flight from Brisbane to Darwin and rest his damaged tendon. Hayden, 36, will continue treatment in Brisbane with the goal of being fit for Australia's four-match test series in India, beginning early October. The Australian team will also be missing captain Ricky Ponting through injury and fast bowler Brett Lee, who has withdrawn from the squad due to personal issues. All three matches in the Bangladesh series are being played in Darwin
