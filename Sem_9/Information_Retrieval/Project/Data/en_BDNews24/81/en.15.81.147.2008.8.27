 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  BRAC has been selected for this year's Conrad N Hilton Humanitarian Award for its humanitarian services, the chairman of the world's largest NGO said Wednesday. The award, equivalent to $1.5 million, will be given on Oct 20 in Geneva, Switzerland. "To receive the Hilton prize is a great honour and tremendous validation of our work," BRAC chairman Fazle Hasan Abed said in a media briefing at the BRAC Inn Centre on Wednesday. "Billions of people in the world today live in extreme poverty, and it is our goal to transition the poor from receiving aid to controlling their own destinies," he said. The Hilton is the world's largest humanitarian award. BRAC has been chosen from among 225 organisations for this year's prize. It is presented every year in connection with the annual Hilton Humanitarian Symposium which gathers policymakers and world leaders in the humanitarian field to address critical challenges. This year's theme is "The bottom billion: is there a tipping point?" Based in Los Angeles, the Hilton Foundation was created in 1944 by the late hotel entrepreneur and business leader, Conrad N Hilton. bdnew
