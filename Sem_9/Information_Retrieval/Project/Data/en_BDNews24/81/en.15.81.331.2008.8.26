 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)The police filed two cases on Tuesday in connection with the smashing of vehicles by activists following news of detained BNP leader Tarique Rahman's fall in a hospital bathroom, a top police officer said. "Demonstrations violating the state of emergency are a serious matter," inspector general of police Nur Mohammad told reporters after a meeting on law and order at the home ministry. Home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters: "It was a regular meting on law and order. We have discussed how law and order and traffic system can be improved during the upcoming Ramadan." On Tarique's treatment, the secretary said: "I have talked to the doctors after his accident. Arrangements will be made if they suggest any examination." Violence erupted Monday at Dhaka University and Dhaka College, as BNP-backed student activists went on the rampage following news that ailing BNP leader Tarique Rahman injured himself when he slipped and fell in the bathroom of BSMMU Hospital prison ward. One person died after the gas cylinder of a torched microbus exploded. Security measures had been beefed up to avoid further chaos in the capita, Nur Mohammad said. "One person died in yesterday's mayhem, but police took instant action to bring the situation under control," he said. "If anybody takes to the street, cases will be filed against them for violating emergency powers rules and arrests will also be made." "Police are not neglecting the matter," the IG stressed. On the role of the police in a BNP programme scheduled for Wednesday, the police officer said: "We have decided to deploy additional police. No new ban will be imposed, but action will be taken in line with the law if anybody violates the EPR." BNP is scheduled to hold a human chain pressing for the unconditional release of its party chief Khaleda Zia, and release of her elder son Tarique Rahman to seek overseas treatment. Police had earlier stopped the party's Aug 21 programme of marching on the Chief Adviser's Office to submit a memorandum making the same demands. bdne
