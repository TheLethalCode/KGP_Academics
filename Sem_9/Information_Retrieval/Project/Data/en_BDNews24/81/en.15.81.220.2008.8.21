 MOSCOW/TBILISI, Thu Aug 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia began pulling tanks and armor back over its frontier, pledging all forces would quit Georgia's heartland by Friday night, but Tbilisi said Moscow was determined to keep a grip on the country. The West has been waiting with increasing impatience for signs of a full-scale pullout of troops and armor that Russia sent into its small Caucasus neighbor two weeks ago. Continued delays have raised fears of a drift back into conflict. "I can see 21 T-72 tanks moving towards the Roki tunnel in the direction of Russia," said a Reuters reporter at the tunnel, which is a few km (miles) from the Georgian-Russian border and is the main access route for Russian forces. "I can also see four Grad artillery launchers, several armored personnel carriers, and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel," the reporter said. Outside the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, near the border, engineers were building tent camps, possibly to accommodate withdrawing troops. But the picture was mixed. Alexander Stubb, Finnish Foreign Minister and chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he saw no sign of Russian troops leaving the key town of Gori. "Certainly here on the road we have seen lots of (Russian military) personnel," he told reporters. He also accused Russian forces of meting out "atrocious" treatment to a group of about 15 elderly ethnic Georgians who appeared to have been evicted from their homes in nearby South Ossetia. "What we have just seen is atrocious. There are Russian Interior Ministry special forces bringing old people from villages, basically emptying the villages on the South Ossetian side and dumping them in Gori," he told Reuters
