<TEXT>
 BRISBANE, Australia, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's acting captain Michael Clarke said the postponement of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan until 2009 was a "great result" for the players. On Sunday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) bowed to the inevitable when it postponed the tournament, due to take place next month, after facing a possible boycott from five countries concerned over the threat of terrorism. "It's a great result for all the players just to find out whether we're going or not going," Clarke told reporters on Monday in Brisbane, where the Australians are preparing for a one-day series against Bangladesh in Darwin. "I think all the guys are happy now we know now that the ICC, Cricket Australia and ACA (Australian Cricketers' Association) would make a decision, and they've finally done that. "It's a tournament (title) Australian currently holds and next year, whenever they put it on we'll look forward to retaining that trophy. "Right now all the guys are rapt the ICC has made a decision." Clarke also said he was not bothered by England opener Marcus Trescothick's admission that he used saliva from breath fresheners during the 2005 Ashes series to help keep a shine on the ball. England won the series thanks in no small part to their bowlers' ability to get reverse swing. Trescothick wrote in his recently-released autobiography that during the series it was his responsibility to keep the shine on the ball. "Marcus has written a book, hasn't he?" asked Clarke. "Well, good luck, like I say, that's in the past. "We'll get our chance in the next 15 months to play against the Poms (English) back in England.
