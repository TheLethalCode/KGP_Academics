<TITLE> Israel settlement surge draws Rice criticism </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Tue Aug 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Israel on Tuesday to avoid undermining peace efforts with the Palestinians after a report that it had nearly doubled construction in Jewish settlements. Israel's Peace Now group, citing data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, said construction had begun on more than 443 structures in settlements in the occupied West Bank since January compared with 240 starts in the same period in 2007. Rice, on a new Middle East visit in a long-shot effort to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal by year's end, reiterated at a news conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni her long-standing criticism of settlement building. "I think it's no secret, and I have said it to my Israeli counterparts, that I don't think that settlement activity is helpful," Rice said. "In fact, what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided," she said. Palestinians say settlement building denies them land they want for a contiguous state. A U.S.-backed peace "road map" calls on Israel to halt all settlement activity in the West Bank and for Palestinians to rein in militants. Israel has said it intends to continue to build in settlement blocs it wants to keep in any future peace deal with the Palestinians. Livni said Israeli settlement activity had been reduced "in the most dramatic way", especially in areas east of the barrier Israel is constructing in the West Bank, a project it terms a security necessity and Palestinians condemn as a land grab. "The peace process is not, and should not be, affected by any kind of settlement activities," Livni added, cautioning against allowing what she termed "noise" to derail peace negotiations. Rice, on her seventh visit to the Middle East this year, has said she still hopes a peace agreement can be reached by January, when President George W. Bush leaves office. "I believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved, and indeed their positions, somewhat closer together," Rice told the news conference. But few analysts believe Rice, who saw Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before meeting Livni, can secure a major breakthrough. Progress towards a peace deal has been hampered by violence, Israeli settlement expansion and political uncertainty in Israel stemming from a corruption scandal involving Olmert. Livni is widely regarded as the frontrunner in a Kadima party leadership race to replace Olmert, undermined by the corruption allegations. He has said he would resign after his successor is chosen. Olmert could, however, stay on for months as caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed, although many in Israel doubt that as a lame duck leader he would be able to put a peace deal in motion. Later in the day, Rice plans to hold talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah
