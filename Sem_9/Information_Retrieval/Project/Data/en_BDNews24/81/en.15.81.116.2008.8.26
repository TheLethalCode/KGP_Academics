 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has deferred the trial in the Bashundhara bribery case against senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman and others until Wednesday. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Judge's Court-3, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, on Tuesday pushed back the date on the appeal of the defence who argued that the Chamber Judge's Court was set to hear the appeal for scrapping the case. Tarique was not produced in the court as he had been exempted from personal appearance while former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar and Bashundhara Group director Abu Sufian were taken to the court. The court on July 14 started the trial in the bribery case. Other accused in the case are Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam, his two sons Safiat Sobhan and Shahdat Sobhan, Tarique's associate Miah Nuruddin Apu and businessman Kazi Salumul Haque Kamal. All of them are currently on the run. The Anticorruption Commission on May 6 pressed charges against the eight people at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. They stand accused of taking about Tk 21 crore in bribe to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir, another Bashundhara director. Sabbir was murdered on July 4, 2006 and the case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdne
