 Dhaka, August 27 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has granted former BNP minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan six months' anticipatory bail in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case. The court has also extended Bhuiyan's bail in GATCO graft case by four months. The bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Md Emdadul Haq Azad passed the order Wednesday. The court ordered all concerned not to harass Bhuiyan before charge framing in the Barapukuria coalmine case and asked the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the case should not be declared illegal. The ACC filed the graft case on February 26 against 16 including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 BNP-led coalition government ministers charging them with resorting to irregularities and corruption in contracting out Barapukuria coalmine development work. The case is currently being reinvestigated. Other accused in the case include former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, BNP's MK Anwar, Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, AKM Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury. The same court has granted bail to Khaleda, Shamsul Islam, Anwar and Nizami in the Barapukuria coalmine case. It also extended Mannan Bhuiyan's bail in the GATCO case by another four months. The court on July 28 granted Bhuiyan two months' bail in the case, which is scheduled to terminate on September 28. bdnews24.c
