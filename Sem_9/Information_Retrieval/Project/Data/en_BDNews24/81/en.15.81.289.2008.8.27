 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Wednesday asked the European Union countries to send observers to the parliamentary elections set for December. He asked the envoys of EU countries at a meeting to positively consider the matter even if it needed special permission. As European Commission ambassador Stefan Frowein asked him about the withdrawal of the state of emergency, the adviser said, "the state of emergency in Bangladesh is different." Envoys of Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, UK, Sweden, Germany and Denmark were present at the meeting at the foreign ministry. The EC first secretary in Dhaka Charles Whiteley earlier said that they would decide by the end of September whether to send polls observers to monitor the ninth parliamentary elections. He said the commission's exploratory mission had reported to the European Commissioner for External Affairs in July on the state of emergency and the political situation. "The report elaborated the state of emergency and the existing political situation in Bangladesh. But I don't want to share the specific recommendations of the exploratory team," said Whiteley. "The EC Commissioner for External Affairs by the end of September will decide whether the polls observation mission will be sent to Bangladesh," he told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Whiteley is in charge of political, economic, trade, press and information affairs of the delegation. The European Commission sent an 'exploratory team' to Bangladesh on June 15 to assess the political situation. The team had talks with political parties, government officials, journalists and civil society representatives to learn whether an 'election-friendly' atmosphere' existed in Bangladesh for holding the general elections. European Union member of parliament Nirj Deva in early August told reporters in Dhaka that the EU would not send an observation mission to Bangladesh if the parliamentary polls were held under the state of emergency. The local EC mission issued no official comment on Deva's statement. But French ambassador in Dhaka Charley Causeret in an interview in August told bdnews24.com that the issue of sending a polls observation mission was yet to be finalised. France is the current chair of the 27-member European Union. bdnew
