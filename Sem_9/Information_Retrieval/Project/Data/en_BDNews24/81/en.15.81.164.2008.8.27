<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League acting general secretary, Syed Ashraful Islam, has expressed the fear that if Jatiya Sangsad elections are not held in December they will not be held within the next five years. Ashraful, speaking at a discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, said: "We have been cooperating with the government. If any conspiracy to defer the election date is hatched, Awami League will unitedly resist it." AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta said: "All issues need to be solved through discussion with the political parties. We agree to register with the Election Commission. But the state of emergency has to be withdrawn and the registration deadline extended." "After December this government will become illegal. There is a limit to our tolerance. Awami League will not stay idle." The AL acting general secretary, aiming at government policy makers, said: "Do not take any unilateral decision. Awami League will not accept any unilateral decision. Do not take any decision that can put the caretaker government's existence into crisis." "If the election is not held in the second week of December and if there is any conspiracy to foil the election process, the Awami League will not sit idle," Ashraful said. Demanding immediate announcement of the election date, the AL leader said: "We want to warn the government of a dark future if the election is not held. You have conducted a lot of experiments, but all have failed." On the Election Commission's counter letter wanting to know the reason for further talks, in reply to AL's seeking further dialogue, he said: "We mentioned the reason in our letter." "We will not go to talk commodity prices with the Election Commission," he pointed out. AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, meanwhile, repeated once more that his party demanded national elections ahead of all others. "We still say hold national elections in October. If upazila elections must be held after that, we will accept it. People do not want any more instability." Organised by Swadhinata Chikitsak Parishad, Tuesday's discussion was organised in connection with National Mourning Day on Aug 15. SCP president Prof M Ruhul Huq presided. bdnew
