 BEIJING, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Not content with topping the Olympic gold medal count on home turf, China has demanded its athletes take medals from the United States and other powers in athletics and swimming at future Games. China's 51 golds at Beijing left the United States well in its wake on 36, but came mostly from its traditional power sports like gymnastics, diving and table tennis.

"Also, we have already mined our full potential in our strong sports at Beijing. Only through widening our gold-winning face  can we adapt to the fierce competition in future," Liu said. China's track and field athletes managed only two bronzes, with gold medal hopeful Liu Xiang pulling out of the defense of his 110 meters hurtles title due to a leg injury. The United States topped the athletics table with 23 medals, including seven gold. The Olympic hosts reaped a better harvest in the pool, snagging a gold, three silver and two bronze medals, but still a far cry from the 22 gold medals amassed by American swimmers. Liu called on China's athletes to make greater sacrifices and upbraided a "minority" of teams that had failed to fulfill their promise in Beijing.
