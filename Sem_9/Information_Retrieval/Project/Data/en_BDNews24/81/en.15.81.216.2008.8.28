<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has asked the government to explain in two weeks why the 'Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance 2008', which allowed the Truth and Accountability Commission to come into being, should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed passed the order on a writ petition filed on Thursday. The petitioners are Supreme Court lawyer Adilur Rahman Khan, Unnayan Bikalpa Nirikkha Gobeshona executive director Farida Aktar, Awami League's women affairs secretary Dipu Moni and Odhikar acting director Nasiruddin Elan. They filed the writ petition on Monday. The petitioners urged the High Court to repeal the Truth and Accountability Commission Ordinance, which they claimed was unconstitutional. According to the ordinance, any person convicted for two years or less for corruption may seek clemency by divulging the truth to the Truth Commission and returning any wealth earned through corruption by a specified time. Advocate Toufique Newaz standing on behalf of the writ petitioners said the ordinance had come into force as an alternative to the disposal of graft cases in court, which was unconstitutional. According to Article 35 of the Constitution, no other authorities beyond law courts have the jurisdiction to try criminal offences. The court asked the president's secretary, cabinet secretary, home secretary, ACC chairman and TAC chairman (the respondents) to reply to the rule. Advocate Toufique Newaz also said, the ordinance had not declared TAC a court, which rendered its provision to confiscate property of individuals and similar provisions unconstitutional. Besides, the ordinance also ordained TAC's independence to 'choose and pick' among the offenders. Advocate Newaz also said, "The section 29 of the Truth Commission Ordinance says, if the Truth Commission on consultation with the Supreme Court seeks assistance of the Judiciary the judiciary will be obliged to give the assistance. This provision is against the main frame of the constgitution. Because as per the article 106 of the Constitution the Supreme Court can give advice is the President sends any matter to it. The provisions of the Truth Commission Ordinance will destroy the independent judiciary." He told the court, in line with the constitution every ordinance has to be presented before the Parliament within 30 days of its going into session. But the Truth Commission Ordinance has been done in such a manner that it is not presented in the Parliament. He also pointed out how and where the ordinance contravened a number of other constitutional provisions. It argued that the president cannot pass any law during a caretaker government's regime other than those related to the elections or an emergency. In reply attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed standing for the government said, "The Truth Commission Ordinance is not against the Constitution. By promulgating the Ordinance the corrupt persons have been given an opportunity. The Ordinance provides an opportunity to them to get mercy by depositing the money earned through corruption to the government treasury. So nothing unconstitutional has been done." The president signed into law the 'Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance' on June 8 which came to be known as the Truth and Accountability Commission ordinance. bdnews24.com/a
