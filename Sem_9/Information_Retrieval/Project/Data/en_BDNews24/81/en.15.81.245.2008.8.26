 Nottingham, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Stuart Broad claimed a career best five for 23 as England beat visitors South Africa by 10 wickets in the second one-day international Tuesday and take a 2-0 lead in the five match series. England bowl South Africa out for just 83 runs in 23 overs, and then cruised home in 14.1 overs without loosing any wicket. It was the Proteas' second-lowest total in a one day international. Andrew Flintoff took three for 29 and Steve Harmison two for four in one over, while wicketkeeper Matt Prior equalled the world record in ODIs with six catches. The carnage began when Herschelle Gibbs was caught down the leg side for 10, off Broad. Skipper Graeme Smith, who should have been run out when completing his first run, was brilliantly caught by the under-pressure keeper who dived full length in front of first slip and hung on to a spectacular catch with his left hand. That gave Broad his 50th one-day international wicket and he was the second-youngest Englishman to achieve the feat at 22. Only James Anderson was younger. South Africa crashed to 26 for three when Jacques Kallis attempted a square cut, only to edge to Owais Shah at first slip. It was the final ball in a wicket-maiden. Broad then had figures of three for eight from four overs, having dismissed South Africa's three highest-scoring batsmen. Broad added a fourth victim next over when JP Duminy edged to Prior. That was 36 for four after the first ten-over power play period. Flintoff added the wickets of AB de Villiers (lbw) and Mark Boucher (caught behind) to reduce the Proteas to 50 for six. Broad then claimed his first five-wicket haul for his country when he had Johan Botha caught behind, which was Prior's fifth catch. Harmison came on to bowl with seven wickets down and he claimed top scorer Andre Nel (13) with his first ball in the 22nd over of the innings. The batsman's attempted slog was caught at midwicket and it was 68 for eight. Albie Morkel's boundary through midwicket for four in the same over took South Africa past 69, their lowest total in one-day internationals, but he edged Harmison on the next ball and gave Prior his sixth catch. Prior equalled the record for the most catches in an innings, joining Australian Adam Gilchrist, who achieved the feat four times, England's Alec Stewart (Prior's business manager) and Boucher. Prior then scored an unbeaten 45 to led England to victor
