 BEIJING, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Athens champions Argentina won Beijing Olympic men's basketball bronze by outmuscling Lithuania in a 87-75 victory on Sunday. With an injured Manu Ginobili watching from the bench in jeans and a T-shirt, Carlos Delfino stepped up to lead the 2004 gold medallists with 20 points in a physical battle. "We wanted to win this for Manu," Delfino told Reuters. "He tried to warm up for this game but he was in too much pain. It's fantastic to win bronze. This team has incredible heart." Ginobili had been the tournament's leading scorer until he twisted his ankle in the first quarter of Argentina's semi-final loss to the United States, aggravating an old injury. "I tested it before the game but I knew it was going to be very difficult," said the San Antonio Spurs guard. "I wasn't able to run. I didn't try to be a hero. I could have hurt the team. "I'm extremely proud of what these guys have done. It's hard to find words, it's kind of emotional." The Argentines, who had lost to three-times Olympic bronze medallists Lithuania by four points in the group stage, blew the game open in the third quarter. A dunk by from Chicago Bulls forward Andres Nocioni gave Argentina a 20-point lead with 2:14 left in the third, virtually ending Lithuania's hopes. "The players love Manu," said Argentina coach Sergio Hernandez. "They wanted to win bronze for him." The Americans were playing world champions Spain in Sunday's gold medal game
