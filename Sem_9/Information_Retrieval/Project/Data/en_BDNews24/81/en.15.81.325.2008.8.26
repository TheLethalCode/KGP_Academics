"There is no need to worry," Siddiqui told reporters Tuesday. "Doctors have assured that the scan may be done anytime in the next couple of days, as his condition is stable."

"As Tarique is now in a hospital cabin, instead of a prison cell, we have nothing to do with [his injuries]," he said. The doctors informed the home secretary that Tarique was out of danger. He had been kept under 48-hour observation and might undergo CT scan if necessary, Hasan said. On whether the prisons authorities were depending on the decision of doctors, Hasan said: "We don't have anything to do on that matter." Asked whether the BNP leader would be sent abroad for better medical treatment, the prisons official said: "This is not our concern."
