<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Around 70 percent of pension-seekers are forced to pay bribesamounting to Tk 8,000 on averageto begin drawing pension money, according to a Transparency International Bangladesh study. The disclosure came at a press conference on a TIB research report on Corruption in Delivery of Public Pension, at the National Press Club on Monday. TIB research fellow KNM Hossainul Haque presented the report, which said that the applicants for pension had to process eight to 11 types of documents to draw money. In the case of family pension, the number of papers increased to 13 to 16 types, with an individual being forced to pay an average of Tk 7,660 in bribes to process the pension papers. On an average, the whole procedure took more than five months or 159 days. Public pension was initiated in Bangladesh in 1924 under British colonial rule. The report said that bureaucratic tangles, weak and outdated record keeping, lack of transparency and accountability and lack of awareness on the part of the pension-holders were the main causes for irregularity and corruption in the sector. The report made a number of recommendations including modernisation of the record keeping system, preparing several copies of documents of all government officials and employees using the system, reducing the steps for receiving the pension, ensuring transparency and accountability and formation of a task force for monitoring the public pension sector. Chairman of TIB's trustee board, Prof Muzaffer Ahmed, speaking as chief guest at the press conference said: "The policy for pension funding in our country has to be changed. Pension money is presently allocated from revenue." "This was proper in the British era when the government was small. Now the size and activities of the government have increased substantially." He said separate investments should be made within the sector for providing pension money. On bureaucratic complexity, former adviser of a caretaker government and member of the TIB trustee board Hafiz Uddin Khan said that a welfare officer had to be appointed in every division and office to ease delivery of pension Government officials and employees would have to be given training in this regard, he said. Former ambassador Waliur Rahman, on his own experience of drawing pension said that though he retired from service nine years ago, he had not yet received any pension money as he refused to pay any bribes. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman and Dhaka University Professor Salahuddin M Aminuzzaman were also present at the press breifing. bdne
