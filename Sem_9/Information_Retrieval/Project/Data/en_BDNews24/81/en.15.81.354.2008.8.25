 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to shift all educational establishments on Dhaka city's main roads, and those housed in rented buildings in residential areas, within three months, a UGC official said Monday. Professor Nazrul Islam, chairman of the University Grants Commission, told bdnews24.com the UGC and other concerned bodies would monitor the shifting of the institutions. He said an education ministry circular, issued on Aug 20, stated that unplanned setting up of educational institutions caused traffic gridlock, and that in many cases student clashes led to blockades on main roads. The ministry had taken the decision to relocate the institutions in view of such problems, the circular said. The government has also decided to ask all educational establishments in Dhaka to start classes by 7.30am. The government would issue notice to all institutions concerned, the circular said. The institutions, including private educational establishments housed in rented buildings, would face action in case of non-compliance. They may be stripped of their educational status and forced to cease operations, the ministry warned in its circular. Home ministry, the housing and public works ministry, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, Directorate of Technical Education, and Education Engineering Department have all been asked to take necessary steps to enforce the moves. There are 51 private universities in the country with most of them operating in rented buildings near bustling city roads. bdnews
