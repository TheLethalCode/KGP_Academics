<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal chief Hasanul Haque Inu has asked the government to lift the state of emergency immediately, saying that it had failed to keep corrupt people behind bars while curtailing workers rights. "We do not need rules that cannot keep the corrupt behind bars, but abuses workers' rights," Inu said in a party meeting at the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh auditorium. The JSD president asked people to stay alert and resist what he termed "any attempt to enforce military rule in the country". "We will not allow emergency rule to turn into military rule, or the interim administration to usher in martial law." "The present caretaker government is a failed government, as the situation of the country has worsened under its rule." "All activities of this government are foggy. Signs are apparent that we are going back to the pre-1/11 era. The anticorruption drive is under question. The corrupt are being released one by one." Inu demanded that national polls be held in line with the Election Commission roadmap. "We will not allow the government to divert from the election roadmap," he said. Inu added that his party wanted local elections. "But a decision on the issue will have to be taken in discussion with political parties." "We must work for strong democracy," Inu said, suggesting a 'national government' to this end. bdnew
