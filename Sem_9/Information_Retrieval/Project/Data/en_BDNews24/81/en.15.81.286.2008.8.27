<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 27 (bdnews24.com) The High Court on Wednesday granted Tarique Rahman bail for six months in five separate cases - one on charges of accumulating illegal wealth and four on charges of extortion. The HC bench of justices Sharifuddin Chaklader and Md Imdadul Haque Azad also stayed the proceedings of one of the cases against the BNP senior joint secretary general for six months. Earlier in the day, the home adviser said the government had made significant advances in releasing Tarique Rahman to seek better medical treatment overseas. "We have made much progress, but it will take some more time," MA Matin told reporters after a meeting with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff at the home ministry. On whether the government had taken any further steps for Tarique's medical treatment in the country, Matin said: "He is being treated in line with the jail code." Tarique was meanwhile declared to be 'out of danger' by a doctor on expiry of a 48-hour observation period Wednesday afternoon, after his fall at BSMMU Hospital on Monday. Dr Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon, arthroscopic and joint replacement specialist at BSMMU Hospital, told bdnews24.com after visiting Tarique: "Tarique is now out of danger. Swelling on his head has subsided. He is no longer feverish, but is taking liquid nutrition." Tarique slipped in the bathroom of the prison ward at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital on Monday, sustaining some injury to his head, said doctors who placed him under 48-hour observation. Dr Dolon said: "Tarique is clinically stable now. He doesn't need to be moved to another place for a CT scan. We'll be able to do it here once our hospital equipment is mended." Tarique refused to be transferred to Square Hospital Tuesday when doctors advised his jailers to take him there for a CT scan. Meanwhile, a lawyer of Khaleda Zia said the former prime minister detained in special jail was concerned over her son's health. "Madam is very worried," Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas told bdnews24.com. She stressed the need for the government to make arrangements for Tarique's treatment abroad, he added. The detained elder son of a detained former prime minister, Tarique was transferred to BSMMUH prison ward from Dhaka Central Jail after he was arrested at his Dhaka Cantonment home on March 7, 2007. He faces a number of extortion and bribery cases pending against him. bdnews24.
