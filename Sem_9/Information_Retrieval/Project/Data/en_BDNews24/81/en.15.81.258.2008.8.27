 Dhaka, August 27 (bdnews24.com)A four-party alliance meeting held at the home of BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday morning decided that the leaders will observe their human chain programme peacefully despite a ban imposed by the police late Tuesday night. The alliance will observe human chains countrywide, through the afternoon, to press for the unconditional release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and steps to send her detained elder son, BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, abroad for better medical treatment. Dhaka metropolitan police issued a press note around Tuesday midnight banning the human chain programme announced earlier by the alliance. Briefing reporters after Wednesday moring's meeting, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar said: "Despite incitements, we've asked our allies to observe the human chains peacefully." "I'd like to request the government at the same time not to foil our efforts." Rejecting the police ban, Delwar said: "The government is treating us unfairly by issuing the press note for no good reason." "We've observed such programmes in the past. Today's activity will also be peaceful as before, whereas the government is trying to muddy the waters by deploying police." "The four-party alliance will continue to protest in phases till the government releases Khaleda Zia and sends Tarique Rahman abroad for treatment." Sympathising with the family of the young man killed following riotous protests by activists of BNP's student wing JCD on Monday, the party veteran said: "A vested quarter committed that heinous act and shifted blame on the Chhatra Dal." "I demand proper investigation into the incident and punishment of the offenders." Senior four-party alliance leaders and activists were present at the meeting held at Delwar's Nam Flat residence. bdnews24.
