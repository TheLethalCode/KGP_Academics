 LONDON, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed announced his retirement from English county cricket side Sussex on Wednesday due to a knee injury. "This is a very hard decision for me to make, as I feel that I could possibly play one more year, but out of respect I would only do that if I felt 100 percent," the 38-year-old told the Sussex website (www.sussexcricket.co.uk). "I am going to miss playing for the club greatly. I am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here." Mushtaq has played a major part in the success of his county side, taking 598 wickets in all competitions and bowling more than 26,000 overs. He was the leading wicket taker in the championship for the past five years. Sussex won three championships during his time there.

"In view of the impact he's made, it's difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county.
