 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Upstarts Sheikh Russel KC saw off defending champions Brothers Union 1-0 to move into the last eight of the Citycell Federation Cup in Group C final match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. Sheikh Russel will take on title contenders Abahani Limited in the quarterfinal on Aug 27 at the same venue. Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan topped Group C to set a quarterfinal clash with Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club on Aug 28. The country's lone sports institute handed a 2-1 defeat to Victoria Sporting Club in the day's other match at Gazipur Stadium. Sabuj struck both goals in the 10th and 42nd minutes for the winners while Ripon slotted in the consolatory goal for the losers five minutes from time. At the BNS, a 52-minute strike from Moroccan midfielder Ezzanzoun Said sealed Sheikh Russel's quarterfinal berths at the cost of Brothers, who needed a draw to get to the last eight. Sheikh Russel went into the match needing nothing short of a win after knowing that BKSP had already advanced to the quarterfinals. They pressed hard against a seemingly defensive Brothers Union, but none of the teams were able to control the midfield in the first half. Sheikh Russel produced a couple of chances, though and Johnny's feeble drive went straight to Brothers goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman. In injury time, Russel's Mobarak whipped in a cross from the left, but Moroccan striker Touati Youness volleyed the cross yards off the target. Sheikh Russel stepped up the attack after the half time but hardly found space before Said put them ahead seven minutes into the second half with a curving free kick from outside the right box. Substitute striker Farhad Hossin got himself in a position but with only Sheikh Russel goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury Titu to beat he drove straight to Titu. Brothers had a goal ruled out because of off-side a minute before their opponents scored. Sheikh Russel firmed up their defence after going ahead, allowing Alfaz and Youness in the frontline, but they hardly troubled the Brothers Union backline. Brothers had three good chances but failed to score and avert an early exit from the season's curtain-raiser. b
