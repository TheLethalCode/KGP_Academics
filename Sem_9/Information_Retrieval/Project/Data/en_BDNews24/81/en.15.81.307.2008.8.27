 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government has a 'strong commitment' to address money-laundering problems in Bangladesh, a visiting assessment team of Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has said. "Not only the interim government, but the government in 2002 was keen to address the issue with enforcement of the Money Laundering Prevention Act," David Shannon, head of the APG delegation, said at a meeting with the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries on Tuesday. APG is an autonomous and collaborative international organisation consisting of 38 member countries across the Asia Pacific region. Its money laundering group's key roles include assessment of compliance by APG members, and technical and training assistance for cooperation with international anti-money laundering networks. Shannon said their initiative aimed to ensure that proceeds from crime do not infiltrate the economy. "Another important area is to address the issue of terrorism financing," he added. Businesspersons and officials of the central bank attended the meeting chaired by FBCCI vice president Abul Kashem Ahmed. The business community highlighted the need for simplified taxation laws to reduce money laundering. Former FBCCI chief Manzur Ahmed also stressed that Bangladeshi businesses harboured untaxed money for reinvestment, not to finance terrorism. The taxation laws are designed to harass people and so the businessmen tend to avoid it, he claimed. "Please do not link 'business money laundering' with terrorism financing in this country," he told the APG delegation. Speaking to bdnews24.com later, Shannon said Bangladesh needed mechanisms to identify suspicious bank transactions so that they can be tracked through proper investigations. He emphasised a 'close watch' on legitimate financial institutions. "[Financial institutions] need to understand that financial information is very important and should not fall into wrong hands," said the head of the five-member APG delegation. He added that the banking sector had made progress in countering money laundering. bd
