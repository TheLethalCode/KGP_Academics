<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnes24.com) - The government will not allow any PSI (Pre-Shipment Inspection) companies to operate in Bangladesh after 2009, with the customs department to be equipped with workforce and modern facilities to do the job instead, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Thursday. "As there are many allegations of irregularities against the PSI companies now working in Bangladesh, the government has decided to discontinue their services after 2009," Mirza Aziz said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on government procurement at the planning commission in Dhaka. The PSI system was introduced in 2000 with the aim to accelerate the import procedure and make it hassle free. Dividing the globe into five blocks, the government in 2005 appointed five PSI companies for each block under three-year contracts, to oversee import procedure. However, a contract with Cotecna Inspection SA was cancelled after some dispute with authorities. At present, four PSI companies  SGS Bangladesh Ltd, Bureau Veritas BIVAC (Bangladesh) Ltd, Intertek Testing Ltd and OAM Inspection Company  are still operating. Their contracts are scheduled to end on Aug 31. However, the government has decided to extend the contracts by another 16 months till December 2009, having completed the tender process. Asked why the government has decided to extend the terms with the PSI companies' even after allegations of irregularities against them, the finance adviser said: "Actions will be taken when allegations are proven against anybody." "Right now our customs department is not equipped to operate PSI operations. So we have extended the contracts (of the private companies) for a limited period." "We hope [the customs department] will be ready by 2009 through appointing necessary workforce and by procuring necessary equipment, including scanner machines," he added. Under the extended contract, the four PSI companies will still cover five blocks, with SGS operating in two blocks. They will get Tk 375 crore from the government for this service. In lien with regulations, the PSI companies will charge one per cent of the total import value from importers; the amount will be deposited with the government exchequer. bdnews2
