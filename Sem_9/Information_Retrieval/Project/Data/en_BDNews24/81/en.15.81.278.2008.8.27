 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities have released businessman and Awami League leader Salman F Rahman on bail from Kashimpur jail, a senior prisons official said. Salman was released from the jail in Gazipur at 12:30pm on Wednesday, deputy inspector general (DIG) prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said. His lawyer barrister Rafique-ul-Huq on Tuesday threatened to file contempt of court case against the jail authorities if Salman was not released. The High Court on Aug 20 granted Salman bail in the IFIC Bank corruption case and he got bail in other cases earlier, barrister Huq said. "The bail order of Salman F Rahman has been informed in writing to 16 persons concerned including IG of police and DIG prisons. "If he is not released by this night, tomorrow (Wednesday) contempt of court charges would be filed against the IG, DIG prisons and the jailer of Kashimpur jail. We've already made the affidavit," barrister Huq told bdnews24.com Tuesday evening. The High Court in its orders said if anybody except the Appellate Division intervene in this matter punitive action would be taken against him. The DIG prisons told bdnews24.com Tuesday evening, "We are scrutinising his papers. If the papers are okay we want to release Salman F Rahman by Tuesday night. For this he has been kept outside the lock-up." He also said, "We got his bail papers Monday evening. But those could not be scrutinised on the day." Joint forces arrested the AL leader at his Dhanmondi home on Feb 4 last year. bdnews2
