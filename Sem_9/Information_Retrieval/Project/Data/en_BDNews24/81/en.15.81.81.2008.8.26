<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26(bdnews24.com) The four-party alliance led by BNP will hold its previously announced countrywide human chain programme on Wednesday, demanding Khaleda Zia unconditional freedom, and release of Tarique Rahman for overseas treatment. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain, speaking to reporters after a a prayer meeting on Tuesday, asked party leaders and supporters to make the programme a success. He also asked them to pray in mosques all over the country on Aug 29 for the release of Khaleda Zia and recovery of Tarique Rahman. On the current situation of the detained party chief's son, Delwar alleged that Tarique Rahman was not getting proper care in detention at the BSMMU Hospital prison ward. Decrying the government's attitude toward BNP, Delwar said: "The government is not being fair towards BNP. It is releasing many on grounds of illness but it is showing a 'step-motherly' attitude towards Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman." "We expect an unbiased stance from a neutral government," he said. bdne
