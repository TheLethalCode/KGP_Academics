 BEIJING, Wed Aug 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from a series of explosions which ripped through a chemical plant in southern China has risen to 20, state media said on Wednesday. The bodies of all those reported missing, all of whom were plant workers, have now been found, Xinhua news agency reported. Another 60 people were injured after the blasts early on Tuesday at the factory in Guangxi's Yizou city, it added. About 11,500 residents were forced to evacuate the area. A blaze, which had spread over more than 10,000 square metres (107,600 sq ft), has been extinguished, Xinhua said. "Environment experts went to the area along the Longjiang River, which abuts the plant, to monitor the water quality for contamination," it said. Emergency official Ge Xianmin was quoted as saying poisonous gases, mainly sulfurated hydrogen and carbon monoxide, had been released. The regional environmental protection department said there was no evidence of contamination. "Residents within 1 km (0.6 miles) should be safe, but rescuers still needed to wear masks," Xinhua said. "Regional work safety authorities are investigating the cause of the accident." The plant, owned by the Guangxi Guangwei Chemical Co., mainly produced polyvinyl acetate, calcium carbide and vinyl acetate monomer -- chemicals used in making paints, adhesives and coatings, Xinhua said
