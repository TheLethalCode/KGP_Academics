 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian Novak Djokovic will be hoping to send a warning to his title rivals at the U.S. Open when he makes his tournament bow on Wednesday. The 21-year-old third seed, who won his first grand-slam title at the Australian Open in January and claimed the bronze medal at the Olympics, takes on Frenchman Arnaud Clement in the first round. Runner-up to Roger Federer last year, Djokovic is chasing Rafael Nadal and the Swiss at the top of the rankings and believes his victory in Australia has improved his chances of winning in New York. "It gives you relief and confidence," Djokovic said. "It gives you a belief that when you find yourself in those certain important moments when you just need to come up with something good and something special and just try to be calm and hold your nerves. "That's what happens when you have experience with winning grand slams. That's why Roger and Rafa are so dominant and they look so good on the court when they have important moments." Former champion Andy Roddick opens his bid for a second title when he plays Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in the late match, while fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia is also in first-round action. In the women's draw, second seed Jelena Jankovic, Olympic champion Elena Dementieva and former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova play their second-round matches. Serbian Jankovic faces Swede Sofia Arvidsson, fifth seed Dementieva takes on Pauline Parmentier of France while third seed Kuznetsova, who beat Dementieva in the final in 2004, plays Sorana Cirstea of Romania
