 WASHINGTON, Fri Aug 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama prolonged the suspense on his vice presidential pick on Friday, saying he has chosen an independent voice who could be an effective governing partner -- but not revealing the name. Obama has dragged out the announcement of a No. 2 for maximum political impact, but is running out of time. The Democratic nominating convention opens on Monday, with the vice president accepting the nomination on Wednesday. "I'm pretty disciplined on this," he said on CBS's "The Early Show" when asked about the choice. Obama, 47, a first-term Illinois senator, said he had searched for a running mate who will be prepared to step in as president and one who could help him govern. "The third criteria for me I think was independence. I want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy-making," he said. Obama's announcement could come at any time, and he is expected to appear with his choice on Saturday in his home state of Illinois as they launch their run to the convention in Denver. History has shown the choice of a running mate is unlikely to have a major impact on the November 4 White House election between Obama and Republican John McCain, but along with the upcoming conventions the choices give both candidates a chance for the political spotlight. Speculation about Obama's choice has centered on three prime contenders -- Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden. But Obama was happy to let the vice presidential speculation fade on Thursday as he focused on McCain's inability to say how many houses he owns. Obama says that proves McCain is out of touch with the economic struggles of most Americans. In an interview with the Politico newspaper on Wednesday, the Arizona senator was asked how many houses he owns with his wife Cindy, a wealthy heiress to a beer distributorship. "I think -- I'll have my staff get to you," McCain replied. "It's condominiums where -- I'll have them get to you." The Politico said McCain's staff counted "at least" four houses, although other media reports found at least seven. On CBS, Obama noted McCain's recent comments that the economy was "fundamentally strong" and has made progress under President George W. Bush. He said McCain "obviously doesn't have a very clear sense of what ordinary Americans are going through." Obama returned to his home town of Chicago on Thursday night and has no public events scheduled during the day, raising expectations that the announcement on his vice president is imminent. McCain also is taking a day off the campaign trail on Friday at home in Arizona
