<TITLE> GE on Olympic winner's podium, but is it gold? </TITLE>

 Scott Malone and Kirby Chien - Analysis BOSTON/BEIJING, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As the Beijing Olympics wrapped up, General Electric Co was taking its final strides in a race to sell everything from medical equipment to television advertisements while cementing ties with the leaders of the world's fastest-growing economy. The Olympian effort brought in $1.7 billion in revenue, landing the No. 2 U.S. company by market capitalization a spot on the winner's podium. And the gold medal would be tighter ties with Chinese authorities that will help it reach its target of $10 billion in annual Chinese sales by 2010. GE's NBC Universal unit paid about $900 million for the rights to broadcast the games in the United States. The conglomerate was one of 12 companies including McDonald's Corp and Johnson & Johnson said to have paid up to $100 million each to be a top sponsor of the event. GE declined to confirm either figure, citing contractual obligations. "The initial investment is one of just building a relationship with the country," said Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE's Transportation unit, which announced the delivery of the first of 300 locomotives to China in Beijing on Thursday. "It's not intrinsically linked to the Olympics itself. It's linked to China being an important marketplace." For NBC, the payoff has been clear. The television network captured some of its best ratings in almost two decades as tens of millions of viewers tuned in to watch American swimmer Michael Phelps win a record-setting eight gold medals. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt has joked that Phelps, 23, should become the youngest vice president in the company's history as a reward for the ratings boost. "You have to think about a place like China as our second home market," Immelt said in an interview on GE-owned CNBC television this week. "We made a big statement here with the Olympics and the sponsorship and we're not disappointed." Some human-rights advocates have criticized the generally glowing picture of China provided to American viewers by NBC during the Olympics. There has been little coverage of human rights questions -- such as the prevention of protests by the Chinese authorities even in areas designated for them. "It's pretty clear that (GE and NBC) don't want to offend the Chinese," said Josh Friedman, director of international programs at Columbia University's graduate school of journalism. "It's an interesting news story. People in the United States are very interested in human rights in China." From the perspective of the Chinese authorities and many Chinese people who are reveling in the success of the Olympics, the tone of the coverage may well be regarded as a reason to regard NBC and GE as trustworthy. RELATIONSHIP PROMOTION Marketing experts said GE's extensive role in the Olympic build-out -- it sold lighting, water-treatment gear and other equipment used in all 37 Olympic venues -- will help boost its profile with top Chinese authorities. "When I look at GE's involvement, they took it to a brand-new level of saying, 'Hey look. Look at all the touch points that GE has on the Olympic green, in the Olympic village, all the power, the lighting, all that stuff. If we can do that for BOCOG (the Beijing organizing committee), think what we can do for you'," said Robert Prazmark, who has consulted on Olympics sponsorship for two decades. But name recognition does not guarantee orders. GE faces tough competition with rivals including Germany's Siemens AG, Japan's Mitsui & Co and Swiss ABB Ltd, all of which are aggressively growing in China. "Foreign sponsors of the Olympics will gain from greater brand awareness and overall better image in the minds of Chinese around the country. And that will help them expand their market share in China," said Chen Jian, executive president of the Beijing Olympic Economy Research Association. "Improving relations with the state is another matter, it is not as easy," he added. STAGNATION AHEAD? Whether the focus on China will pay off in the long term for GE, which is forecast to generate $190 billion in worldwide revenue this year, will partly depend on whether China's economic growth slows now that the nation's $40 billion Olympic building binge is behind it. "Does the Chinese economy continue to build and grow, or does it begin to stagnate?" said Eric Schoenstein, principal at Jensen Investment Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns GE shares. If the company's Chinese orders and backlog continue to grow and GE doesn't lose money on its investment in the Olympics, he sees its strategy as positive. GE officials said the company's Olympic business has been profitable. They do not expect China's economy to slow, noting that growing cities in the western part of the country will continue to invest in big infrastructure projects such as power plants and airports even if Beijing takes a post-Olympics breather. But investors note that because of its size and international reach, GE likely would be enjoying strong sales growth in China regardless of its Olympic involvement. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company is also growing rapidly in the Middle East without sponsoring a major event there and fellow U.S. blue-chip industrials United Technologies Corp and Caterpillar Inc, neither a sponsor of the games, have also reported strong sales growth in China. If China's investment in infrastructure projects slows, goodwill alone won't boost the conglomerate's sales. "They'll continue to see the growth, but that trend will probably decelerate to some degree," said Perry Adams, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Huntington Private Financial Group, in Traverse City, Michigan, which holds GE shares. "Obviously the global economy is slowing, and I think China as well is going to slow to some degree."
