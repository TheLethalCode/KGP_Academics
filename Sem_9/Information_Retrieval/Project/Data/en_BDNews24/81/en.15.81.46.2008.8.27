<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited thrashed Sheikh Russel KC 2-0 to move into the semifinals of the Citycell Federation Cup at Banganbandhu National Stadium Wednesday. Jahid Hasan Emily put B. League champions Abahani ahead in the very first minute while Arif Khan Joy sealed the match five minutes from time to set the semifinal clash with sensational Farashganj Sporting Club on Aug 29. The match was delayed 20 minutes as light bulbs at the Big Bowl went off halting play for six minutes after 14 minutes of play. The players from both sides could hardly control themselves on the rain-soaked pitch that forced the quarterfinalists to be a long-pass- based game after the popular sky-blues outfit went ahead in the tournament's quickest lead before Sheikh Russel could stand. Ghanaian Awudu Ibrahim whipped in a cross from the left and striker Emily rose high to head the cross home, giving no chance to Sheikh Russel goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury to react. It was the fourth goal in as many matches for Emily. Then, Sheikh Russel KC tested Abahani's Biplob Bhattacharjee, the country's number two goalkeeper, with some long-range shots and Russel, who saw off Brothers in the group stage, came close to equalising the margin in the sixth minute when a 30-yard powerful left-footer from Alfaz Ahmed ricocheted off the Abahani crossbar to frustrate Sheikh Russel. In the midway of the first half, Abahani's medio Pranotosh capitalising on an Abul free kick nodded a chance wide while the Abahani keeper-cum-captain gripped Manwar Hossain's drive at near post in his second attempt. After the breather, Sheikh Russel bossed the game to press hard on the Abahani defense marshalled by Ibnul Siraji, Ghanaian Samad Yussif, M Shujan and Waly Faisal, who successfully foiled all chances, to keep the Dhanmodi-based outfit's territory safe. Even, Abahani doubled the lead five minutes from time when Joy being set up by Abul dragged the top of the right side of the box to find the back of Sheikh Russel net.
