 SRINAGAR, India, Sun Aug 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in Indian Kashmir on Sunday ahead of a separatist rally, the latest in a series of protests against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region. Kashmir has seen in the past two weeks some of the biggest pro-independence demonstrations since a separatist revolt against New Delhi's rule broke out in the region in 1989. Separatist leaders plan to address a huge rally on Monday in Lal chowk in the heart of Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, where a three-day strike called by separatists began on Saturday. "As a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed from 4 a.m. today," a government statement said, adding there was threats to the lives of some of the separatist leaders. It did not give any more details. Thousands of police and troops were patrolling the region's empty streets to enforce the curfew. The protests were sparked after a dispute with the region's Hindus over transfer of land to a Hindu shrine trust, bolstering separatist sentiments in Kashmir
