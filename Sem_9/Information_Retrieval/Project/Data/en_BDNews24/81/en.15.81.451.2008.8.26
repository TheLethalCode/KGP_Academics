 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank has drafted a set of regulations to speed up money transfer by expatriates through mobile phone banking, the central bank chief said Tuesday. The central bank has asked banks to submit their written opinions on the draft regulations in two weeks on the move to ensure money is transferred through SMS with mobile phone outlets working as payment centres. The decision came from a meeting, presided over by Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, with chief executives of the banks that run mobile banking services and Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission officials. "We are contemplating the introduction of mobile banking to speed up the remittance from expatriate workers," Salehuddin told bdnews24.com. "The central bank has made a draft regulation to put the legal framework in place," he said. But, he added, the matter was at the initial stages. "A final decision will be taken after the banks and BTRC submit their opinions on the matter," he said. On the key issues of the draft regulation, Salehuddin said: "Nothing can be said on the matter now, but we have to ensure foremost that the remittances are not lost." Association of Bankers of Bangladesh chairman and City Bank executive director Mahmud K Sattar told bdnews24.com that they had welcomed the proposal. "We will send our views on it by Sept 10," he said. Foreign workers sent back a record $8 billion or Tk 54,700 crore in 2007-08 fiscal year, $2 billion more than the previous fiscal year, which the governor put down to moves taken to bring in more money through banking channels, including measures against hundi transactions. But, central bank officials concede, a large amount of money was still coming from abroad through illegal routes, as sending foreign remittance through banks still proved costlier and time-consuming. The mobile banking initiative is being considered with the interests of remittance-receiving customers in mind, Salehuddin had previously told bdnews24.com. He said a Bangladesh Bank delegation visited the Philippines last year to see how remittance was sent to the country through SMS banking. On how the system may work, a BB official told bdnews24.com that the branches or exchange houses of the banks in different countries would inform a local bank or exchange house of the amount being sent by an expatriate worker. The bank or exchange house concerned will inform the recipient of the remittance through an SMS, and will request the recipient to collect the money from a mobile phone outlets working as payment centres. The Bangladesh Bank governor said an 'airtight' legal framework would be put in place so that the hard-earned money of overseas workers was not lost through the process in any way. Salehuddin said the country would certainly be less dependent on foreign aid and the economy would get a lift if more remittance came through the proper channels. bdnews24.
