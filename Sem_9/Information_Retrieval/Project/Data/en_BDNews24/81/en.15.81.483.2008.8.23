 TORONTO, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Xavier Marshall hammered a record 12 sixes in an unbeaten 157 to lead West Indies to a 49-run victory over the host nation in the Canada Cup Tri-Series in King City, Ontario on Friday. Batting first at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, tournament favourites West Indies piled up 303 for four in 50 overs before bowling out Canada for 254. Man of the match Marshall, 22, also struck 11 fours in 118 balls of explosive batting as he surpassed the previous best total for one-day international sixes. Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya struck 11 sixes when he hit 134 against Pakistan in Singapore in April 1996. Six months later Pakistan's Shahid Afridi followed suit in an innings of 102 against Sri Lanka in Nairobi. Marshall, playing his 17th one-dayer, demoralised the Canadian attack after West Indies opted to bat first. He dominated stands of 128 for the third wicket, with Leon Johnson, and 111 at almost 10 runs an over for the unbroken fifth wicket, with Australian-born Brendan Nash. Johnson weighed in with 51 and Nash a whirlwind 39 not out. In reply, Canada opener Rizwan Cheema top-scored with 89 but his dismissal in the 19th over sparked a slide as the hosts were bowled out with 16 balls to spare. Left-arm seamer Nash was the leading wicket-taker with three for 56. West Indies and Canada meet again in the final on Sunday after both teams beat Bermuda in their opening matches
