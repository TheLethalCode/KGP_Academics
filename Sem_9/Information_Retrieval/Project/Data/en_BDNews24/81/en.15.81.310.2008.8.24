 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University teachers belonging to the Awami League-backed 'Blue Panel' have demanded removal of present pro-vice chancellor and treasurer and appointment of "neutral persons" to the two posts. The teachers, at a press conference at Dhaka University Teachers Club on Sunday, also pressed for the schedule of elections to other administrative posts including teachers' representatives to the university senate, syndicate and academic councils. Convenor of the Blue Panel and dean of social sciences Prof Harun-or Rashid told reporters he met with the vice chancellor the previous day and demanded election of teachers' representatives to the different bodies Prof Harun read from a written statement: "The pro-vice chancellor, treasurer and others who received appointments during the four-party alliance government must be removed and transparent and neutral persons appointed in their place." He also raised concerns over the post of the vice chancellor: "After the expiry of his tenure, the present government gave the vice chancellor temporary appointment. As per rules the senate should elect an independent panel to select the next vice chancellor." Harun, however, alleged that instead of following the rules the present vice chancellor was trying to form a panel with people of his choice. On the defeat of Blue Panel teachers in the recent dean elections, by BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami backed White Panel teachers, Prof Rashid said: "The election was a test case." "It proved that neutral election was not possible under the administration left by the alliance government." He added, however, that the Blue Panel has accepted the results of the dean elections. Asked whether they would participate if election to different management councils of the university were held under the present administration, Prof Harun-or Rashid repeated that the appointments made during the alliance government had to be changed. "We will participate in the election if a proper environment is ensured." Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique of the mass communication and journalism department, general secretary of the Dhaka University Teachers Association Dr Md Anwar Hossain and Dr Muhammad Samad of DU's Social Welfare and Research Institute were among those present at the press briefing. bdnew
