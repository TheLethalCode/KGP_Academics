 LONDON, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Steve Harmison has come out of retirement from one-day internationals to replace the injured Ryan Sidebottom in the England squad to face South Africa, selectors said on Thursday. Harmison, 29, was called up in time for Friday's opening day/night game at Headingley, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement. Sidebottom was ruled out of the first one-dayer in the five-game series with a groin injury. He will be monitored over the next 48 hours to see if he can play in the second game at Trent Bridge on Tuesday. "I feel I have something to offer," said Harmison, who grabbed four wickets in England's victory in the final test against South Africa at The Oval earlier this month on his return to the test team after a five-month absence. New England captain Kevin Pietersen said after the paceman's fine performance that he was trying to persuade Harmison to come out of one-day international retirement as well. "After recently being asked by the England management to reassess my retirement from international one-day cricket I've decided to join England's ODI squad for the NatWest Series after careful consideration," said Harmison. "Due to recent injuries in the England camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series," added Harmison, who had announced his retirement from the one-day game after the 2006/07 Ashes tour of Australia
