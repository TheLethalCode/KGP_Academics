 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday granted former prime minister Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman four months' interim bail each in the Zia Orphanage Trust case. The same bench granted Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami bail in the Barapukuria coal mine corruption case. It also granted bail to BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, advocate Sigma Huda and businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun. The bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Imdadul Haque Azad, granting interim bail to the former prime minister Tuesday, asked the government to show cause why she should not get permanent bail. Contesting the bail petition and representing the Anticorruption Commission, advocate Anisul Haque said: "Khaleda Zia should not be bailed out as she stands accused of serious graft charges." Khaleda's lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmed argued: "Khaleda Zia was never linked with the Zia Orphanage Trust." "When one bailed out former prime minister can tour foreign countries, why should Khaleda Zia be falling behind?" he asked. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq participated in the hearing for Tarique Rahman in the same case. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan assisted him. The ACC filed the case on July 3 against Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and five others charging them with misappropriating Tk 2.1 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust fund. Barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim, another of Khaleda's lawyers, said bail petitions for Khaleda will also be submitted in the next couple of days in the Niko, GATCO and Barapukuria cases. The High Court bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Imdadul Haque Azad also granted interim bail Tuesday to Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami until charges are pressed in the Barapukuria coal mine corruption case. It ordered the government and the ACC to show cause within two weeks as to why he should not be granted permanent anticipatory bail in the case. The same bench granted BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury six month's bail in two extortion cases and four months bail in a theft case. The court also stayed the proceedings of the three cases. The same HC bench granted bail to advocate Sigma Huda, wife former communications minister barrister Nazmul Huda, in an extortion case and stayed the proceedings of the case. It also granted six months anticipatory bail to controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun in two extortion cases. bdnews24.com/a
