 Washington, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US ambassador to the United Nations has been rebuked by senior State Department officials for planning to give "advice and help" to the husband of assassinated former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according to an e-mail obtained on Tuesday. Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari, viewed as being close to the United States, is a strong candidate to take over from President Pervez Musharraf, who resigned last week as his opponents threatened to impeach him. The political crisis in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation on the front lines of the US-led war against Muslim militants in Afghanistan, deepened this week when Nawaz Sharif, another former prime minister, quit a coalition with Zardari's party. With the Bush administration saying it will stay out of Pakistan's politics, the outreach to Zardari by Washington's U.N. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was met with anger from Richard Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs. In a strongly worded e-mail obtained by Reuters but first reported by the New York Times, Boucher demanded clarity from the diplomat and asked why he had not been told in advance of Khalilzad's plans to see Zardari in Dubai next week. "I was on the phone today with Asif Zardari and he mentioned that he was going to be in Dubai on September 2 to meet with you. He says you are providing 'advice and help'," Boucher wrote in the e-mail dated Aug. 18. "Can I ask: What sort of 'advice and help' are you providing?" Boucher also pressed Khalilzad to clarify what "sort of channel" he was opening with Bhutto's husband. "Governmental, private, personnel (sic)? How is he (Zardari) supposed to know," Boucher wrote. "We have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the deals. We are merely keeping in touch with the parties. Can I say that honestly if you're providing 'advice and help?'" THE MEETING IS OFF Pakistan is an important ally for the United States, especially in trying to curb the flow of militants across its border into Afghanistan, where the Taliban has increased attacks on U.S. and other coalition troops in recent months. The political instability in Pakistan has raised concern in Washington, which had praised Musharraf as a committed partner in fighting terrorism. A spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, Richard Grenell, said Khalilzad no longer planned to meet Zardari after speaking to senior State Department officials. "Ambassador Khalilzad had planned to meet socially with Zardari during his personal vacation but because Zardari is now a presidential candidate, Ambassador Khalilzad postponed that meeting after consulting with senior State Department officials and Zardari," Grenell said. State Department spokesman Robert Wood declined to comment on the issue but said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice still had "full confidence" in Khalilzad, who was born in Afghanistan and is a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq. "Ambassador Khalilzad is well known throughout the region and he has a lot of contacts. He is very well informed about the region," Wood told reporters. "The present secretary really does respect his counsel and it is not unusual for senior officials of the government to have wide-ranging contacts with various leaders." In February, Rice mildly chastised Khalilzad for joining Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in a panel debate in Davos, Switzerland, the month before. She summoned him to explain his attendance at the meeting, which had not been cleared beforehand. The United States does not have diplomatic ties with Iran. bd
