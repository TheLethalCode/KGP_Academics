 Dhaka Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Police have imposed a ban on BNP's planned nationwide programme to form 'human chains' on Wednesday, to press for unconditional freedom of party chief Khaleda Zia and release of her elder son Tarique Rahman to seek overseas treatment. A press release faxed from Bangladesh Police Headquarters shortly after Tuesday midnight, undersigned by information officer AKM Kamrul Ahsan, said the programme violates the state of emergency. The police statement said that any human chain programme without prior permission goes against Emergency Powers Rules 2007. It requested all citizens to be loyal to national laws, and refrain from taking part in any such activity. Strict legal steps would be taken against violators of EPR, it added. Police had previously banned the party's Aug 21 programme involving a march on the Chief Adviser's Office to submit a memorandum pressing the same demands. Earlier Tuesday, however, inspector general of police Nur Mohammad had told reporters no fresh ban would be imposed on BNP's programme. Asked about the role of the police in the BNP programme scheduled for Wednesday, the IGP said: "We have decided to deploy additional police. No new ban will be imposed, but action will be taken in line with the law if anybody violates EPR." Speaking after a meeting on law and order at the home ministry, he said: "Demonstrations violating the state of emergency are a serious matter." Violence erupted Monday at Dhaka University and Dhaka College, as BNP-backed student activists went on the rampage following news that the ailing Tarique had further injured himself after slipping in the bathroom of BSMMU Hospital prison ward. One person died during the violent demostrations after the gas cylinder of a torched microbus exploded. Security measures had been beefed up to avoid further chaos in the capital, Nur Mohammad said. "One person died in yesterday's mayhem, but police took instant action to bring the situation under control," he said. "If anybody takes to the street, cases will be filed against them for violating emergency powers rules and arrests will also be made." "Police are not neglecting the matter," the IGP stressed. bdnews2
