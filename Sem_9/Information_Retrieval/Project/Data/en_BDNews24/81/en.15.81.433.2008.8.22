 BEIJING, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world's fastest man Usain Bolt collected his third Olympic gold medal when he helped Jamaica smash the world record to win the men's 4x100 metres relay final on Friday. Bolt, who won the 100 and 200 finals in world record times, teamed up with Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Asafa Powell to clock 37.10 seconds, slashing 0.30 off the mark set by the United States at the 1993 world championships. "You can't explain the feeling that you are feeling at the greatest Olympics everit's won-der-ful," Bolt told reporters. Trinidad and Tobago finished second in 38.06, about 10 metres behind their Caribbean neighbours, and Japan were third in 38.15 as the Bird's Nest was lit up by thousands of popping flash bulbs focusing on Bolt. "This feels like a gold medal right now," said Marc Burns, who ran the second leg for Trinidad and Tobago. "Bolt is an exceptional athlete. For the Caribbean it's just a stepping stone to open doors for Caribbean athletes like myself. No one is ashamed to come in second." Britain, the U.S. and Nigeria, the medallists in Athens four years ago, missed out on the final after mistakes in the heats, leaving Jamaica as overwhelming favourites for gold. "These guys came out there and we decided we were going to break the world record.we've got a great team," Bolt said. The victory provided Jamaica with their fifth gold medal in the sprints in Beijing after they missed out on a clean sweep of all six when the women's team Jamaica's failed to get the baton round in the 4x100, allowing Russia to take a surprise gold. WIDE OPEN Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart, joint silver medallists in the individual 100, over-ran the second changeover and with the U.S. failing to make the final the race was suddenly wide open. "We were disappointed about the women, it was wonderful for us but disappointing for the women," Bolt said. "We understand its one of those things. We're looking forward to both next time." Russia charged through to win in 42.31 with Belgium grabbing a surprise silver and Nigeria picking up the bronze. "There's no reason for us to be disappointed because we've been having a great Olympics," Stewart said. "Maybe it was Russia's destiny to get the gold medal, you never know what God is meaning." There were no mistakes for the men who handed over seamlessly with Bolt running the third leg and Powell, the former world record holder, sprinting clear on the last. "This means a lot we're very happy. We're very excited to take the world record back to Jamaica," Powell said. "Jamaica is the sprint capital and we're going to keep every record.
