 Barisal, Aug 25 (bdnes24.com)Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College was closed for an indefinite period Monday as violent clashes erupted between students and locals after a youth was beaten to death within the college campus on suspicion of being a thief. Riot police have been deployed on the campus and adjoining areas, and students have been ordered to leave the halls within 24 hours from 2pm. However, foreign students will be allowed to stay in dormitories. The decision was taken at a meeting with principal Dr Zahid Hossain in the chair, an academic council member said. Academic council member and head of the forensic medicine department Dr Habibur Rahman told benews24.com: "The college has been closed under fear of attack. The students began leaving the halls after the order."

The man died later the same day while undergoing treatment at the medical college hospital. Following the incident, local people and college students locked in a series of clashes. Locals attacked the college anatomy department, microbiology department and Hall No 1 on Sunday night. They also beat up three students of the college, who have been admitted to the medical college hospital. Assistant commissioner of Barisal metropolitan police Hayatul Islam Khan said that necessary steps have been taken so that the students can reach their destinations safely.
