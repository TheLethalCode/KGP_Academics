 PERMATANG PAUH, Malaysia, Tue Aug 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's leading opposition politician, Anwar Ibrahim, looked set for victory in a by-election on Tuesday which he says will help break the government's five-decade lock on power. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition predicted he would win 55-60 percent of the vote, based on their own exit polls, amid heavy voting for the seat. By 1 p.m. (0700 GMT), turnout was 51 percent and local media reported that roads in the region were jammed as people sought to reach polling stations before they closed at 5 p.m. local time. Anwar, whose campaign has been overshadowed by charges he sodomized a male aide, says his election to parliament after a decade long absence, would be the first step to ending the Barisan Nasional's 50-year reign. Hundreds of his supporters chanted "reformasi" (reform) as Anwar voted in the usually sleepy enclave of Permatang Pauh in northern Malaysia. Most commentators say that Anwar will win the vote, but the question is whether he can win by a sufficient margin so as to emerge as the formal leader of the three-party opposition coalition and so mount a challenge to Barisan. "We are leading by at least 55 to 60 percent of the votes," Tian Chua, vice-president of Anwar's party told Reuters. Earlier Anwar told reporters that he had faced the entire machinery of the state which has slandered him and sought to intimidate him. "So, it is just not Anwar versus the candidates but Anwar versus the Malaysian government, the ruling parties and all the excesses you can think of," he said after he cast his vote. DIRTY CAMPAIGN Anwar supporters called foul in parliament as the government on Tuesday submitted a bill requiring suspects to give DNA samples for a second reading in a nearly empty chamber. They fear the law could be used to tamper with evidence so as to incriminate him at his new trial, which starts on September 10. The bitter campaign has also been marked by accusations of corruption and vote rigging and around 4,000 riot police have been deployed in the sleepy constituency to prevent clashes. There have been no polls of voting intentions in the election which pits Anwar and his three-party coalition against the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party in a coalition that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957. A survey of ethnic Malays by the independent Merdeka Center for Opinion Research showed that less than a third of ethnic Malays, who account for 70 percent of Permatang Pauh's 58,459 voters, believed the sodomy allegations. Anwar, 61, has been found guilty of sodomy before and was imprisoned on that charge and a count of corruption in the late 1990s and then barred from office until April this year. He denies the new charges and says they are the product of a conspiracy to discredit him and scuttle his ambition to dismantle Malaysia's ethnically based economic system, root out corruption and reform the economy to boost economic growth. Anwar was once deputy prime minister and finance minister in the UMNO-led government and backed the very policies which he now opposes. Those policies give ethnic Malays preferential access to universities and the civil service, cheap loans and promotes them as company owners, measures which critics say have stunted economic potential in this Asian nation of 27 million people. Economic concerns, at a time when inflation has surged to 27-year highs, top the agenda for most people. Political uncertainty has unnerved markets pushing the Malaysian ringgit to 9-month lows and the benchmark Malaysian equity index to a 2008 low. Assuming Anwar wins, his next challenge will be garnering the support of 30 government legislators in a parliamentary vote of confidence that he has said he will call in September
