 Amit Talukdar bdnews24.com legal affairs correspondent Dhaka, Aug28 ( bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday acquitted life convicts lt col (dismissed) Syed Farook Rahman, retired lt col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired majors Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin of the charges, and upheld death sentence for Risladar Moslemuddin in the Jail Killing Case. It acquitted two fugitive death convicts Dafadar Marfat Ali and Abul Hashem Mridha. The court upheld life sentence for eight of the 12 convicts. They are Khandaker Abdur Rashid, lt col artillery Shariful Haque Dalim, lt col SHMB Nur Chowdhury, lt col MM Rashed Chowdhury, major Ahmed Sharful Hossain, captain Abdul Mazed, captain Md Kismat Hashem and captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar. The bench of justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Ataur Rahman Khan handed down the judgement following appeals. The court on Aug 18 started delivering its verdict on the appeals by the convicts against the judgement of the trial court. State counsel advocate Anisul Haque termed the verdict 'unfortunate and a farce'. "I am disappointed with the verdict. We will appeal to the Supreme Court," Haque said. "We will continue our legal battle. We have faith in the apex court. We hope to get justice there." "As the High Court did not give any order on the eight life convicts their sentence remains upheld," the counsel said. After the assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, four close political colleagues  Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Monsur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzaman who ran the provisional government of Bangladesh at Mujibnagar  were killed inside the jail on November 3, 1975. The following day the then deputy inspector general of police Abdul Awal filed a case with Lalbagh Police Station against four persons. After the Awami League took office in 1996, police on October 15, 1998  23 years after the case was filed  submitted charge sheet against 23 people including accused Moslemuddin and Farook. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Md Motiur Rahman on October 20, 2004 gave the verdict after the trial had run six years. In the verdict the court handed down death sentence to Moslehuddin, Dafadar Marfat Ali and Dafadar Abul Hashem Mridha. The trial court sentenced 15 accused including Farook, Shahriar Rashid and Bazlul Huda to life. The court cleared retired major Md Khairuzzaman, KM Obaidur Rahman, Shah Moazzem Hossain, Nurul Islam Monjur and Taheruddin Thakur of the charges. The convicts moved the High Court immediately after the verdict. Lancer Mohiuddin was extradited from the United States last year and he appealed against his conviction from jail. The High Court started hearing the appeals against the trial court verdict and death references on July 13 after four years. bdne
