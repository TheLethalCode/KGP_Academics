 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) - In-form batsmen Usman Khawaja and Michael Hill were among the runs again as Australian Institute of Sports crushed the Bangladeshis by nine wickets in the fourth warm-up match in Darwin Monday. The win was set up by fast bowlers Grant Sullivan and Trent Kelly, who scythed through the Bangladeshi top order to limit the visitors to a modest 229. Sullivan had the openers, Tamim Iqbal and Mehrab Hossain jnr, out cheaply while Kelly sent back the dangerous pair of Mohammad Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan. With none of their top five crossing 14, Bangladesh were floundering at 95 for 5 before Alok Kapali made a battling 62 and the lower order chipped in to provide some respectability to the total. Sullivan finished with impressive figures of 4 for 30 from his 10 overs while Kelly took 3 for 41 in his allotted quota. Australia's chase never looked in trouble as their openers provided a solid platform with a 74-run stand before Theo Doropoulos was dismissed. The other opener Khawaja and No. 3 Hill were then involved in an unbroken 154-run association to secure their third win in four matches. Khawaja, who made 94 in the previous match, didn't miss out on a century this time, making 101 that featured five sixes. Hill continued his good showing in the tournament, finishing on 87 off 91 balls. Bangladesh have one more warm-up match, against a Northern Territory Chief Minister's XI on Wednesday, before their three-ODI series which starts on August 30. Curtsey: Cricin
