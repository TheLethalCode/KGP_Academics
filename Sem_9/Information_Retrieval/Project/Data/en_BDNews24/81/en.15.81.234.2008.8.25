<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain Monday said if party chief Khaleda Zia and son Tarique Rahman were not released the four-party alliance would be compelled to call for a series of programmes. He made the remarks when he had come to see Tarique at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital after Tarique slipped in the hospital bathroom, hurting his head. Delwar, however, was refused permission to see him. "If the government does not make a decision on Khaleda Zia and Tarique soon, we will announce programmes. The programme will be observed in phases," he told reporters. He asked the alliance adherents to be ready for the campaign. Delwar reached the main gate of the hospital around 3:30pm and talked with deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui. But after about an hour he was told that he could not meet Tarique. As he was leaving, he said, "A healthy Tarique Rahman has been tortured in the jail so much that his bones are fractured. His treatment is not possible here. The doctors have given their report to the government several times. But the government is not listening." Delwar alleged that Tarique had not been receiving any treatment in the hospital. "The muscle of Tarique's right leg has contracted. The government is responsible for the accident he had [Monday] ." "Many are being sent abroad for treatment. But that did not happen in case of seriously ill Tarique. He is facing disability. We protest this inhuman behaviour of the government." bdne
