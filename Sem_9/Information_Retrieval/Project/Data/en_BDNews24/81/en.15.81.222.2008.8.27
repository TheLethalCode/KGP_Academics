 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Two former heads of the Fair Election Monitoring Association (FEMA) claim that future poll reports of the watchdog may be in question because of a former politician taking over as its president. Former presidents Munira Khan and Abul Ahsan made the allegations following the election of Feroz M Hasan, a former organising secretary of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, at FEMA's annual general meeting on Aug 23. Munira Khan immediately resigned from her post as FEMA president protesting Feroz's election "in violation" of its constitution. When FEMA violates its own constitution, it has no moral authority to certify the standard of other elections," she said. She clarified that the AGM elects a 27-member national committee, which in turn is meant to elect a 15-member executive committee, with at least a 7 seven day gap after the AGM, she said. "I convened an AGM on August 23. But the election commissioner (of FEMA) went ahead with electing the executive committee within hours of the AGM though I protested such an election," said Munira, a life member of FEMA. "I resigned from the post protesting the violation of FEMA's constitution," said Munira Khan. She also protested the election of Feroz as no political figure is eligible to become even a member of FEMA, according to the memorandum and articles of the association. Feroz, however, brushed aside Munira's allegations and said he was no more a political figure as he resigned from the BDB one and half years ago. He told bdnews24.com that he was elected president through an AGM convened by Munira Khan. "Everything was done as per the constitution." "I resigned from the party one and half years ago. I'm not a political man now," he claimed. "Everybody may have some political beliefs or ideology. Because, everybody votes for someone," he added. But Feroz parried a question on why he quit politics and joined FEMA. Former SAARC secretary-general Abul Ahsan Chowdhury, who was also FEMA president from 1986 to 1991, told bdnews24.com that a political figure should not head FEMA. "As he (Feroz) was involved in the politics of Bikalpadhara, people may ask questions about the authenticity of FEMA's election reports in future," he said. He agreed that political figures should not be involved in FEMA and the organisation should uphold its own constitution, but he termed the dispute between Munira Khan and Feroz M Hasan a personal one which intruded into the organisation. Munira Khan, quoting the FEMA constitution, told bdnews24.com: "A member of the society shall cease to be a member if he/she  has been found to be associated with any political party or organisation" "That is why, I and some FEMA members told Feroz to prove his impartiality first and then join FEMA," she said, stressing that no previous FEMA presidents had been associated with politics. "FEMA has lost its credibility, because it has failed to uphold its own constitution. The impartiality of FEMA's future polls observation will be in question." "FEMA certifies the standard of different elections. When FEMA violates its own constitution, it has no moral authority to certify the standard of other elections," she said. bdn
