 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has given political parties from Aug 27 to Oct 15 to apply for registration ahead of parliamentary elections, a must under new electoral laws, the chief election commissioner said Monday. The commission wanted to finalise the registration procedure by Oct 30, ATM Shamsul Huda said. "The commission has sent the draft of the registration regulations for political partiesin line with new electoral lawsto the law ministry," he told reporters at the EC Secretariat. The caretaker government on Aug 19 enforced the new Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Ordinance 2008, making registration of all political parties mandatory who wish to participate in the national elections. "The Election Commission has finalised the electoral laws after two rounds of dialogue with political parties, civil society and professionals and the media. We will implement the law in the national elections slated for December," the elections chief said. "The government has made easy many conditions in the regulations though the commission had toughened them," he said. Huda said if the political parties did not register they would cease to exist. He brushed aside allegations by political parties that the registration requirement was nothing but a move by the commission to control them. "The Election Commission does not want to control the political parties nor does it want to start any de-politicisation process." "We did not have any such thought ever," he said. The CEC said they had always tried to serve the political parties. The election laws were updated so that the two sides -- the commission and the parties -- benefited. The election must be held in December, said Huda, adding: "We have been constantly saying that all parties should participate in the election. If it does not happen the election will not be acceptable, not only to us but to others as well." "The government and the Election Commission are ready to cooperate with the political parties in getting them registered. "The commission will also respond to any suggestions or requests of any party," he said. Huda said the state of emergency should be relaxed across the country so that the parties could hold councils for registration. "If any party asks for it, the Election Commission will request the government to relax emergency and take necessary security measures." If registered the political parties would have discipline, Huda said, adding the door of the EC is always open to any sorts of discussion. "The Awami League wanted to hold discussion with the commission on upazila elections and national elections and we have agreed." "If other parties want to discuss we will respond to them also." He said: "Complications arose before the dialogue was held with the two factions of BNP. Now those are over." "We will welcome it if BNP chairperson-nominated secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain wants to sit for discussion," he said. The schedule for the general elections is expected to be declared in the first week of November and the election to be held in the third week of December. Two other election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hussain and Muhammad sakhawat Husain and EC secretary Mohammad Humayun Kabir were also present at the briefing. bdnews24.
