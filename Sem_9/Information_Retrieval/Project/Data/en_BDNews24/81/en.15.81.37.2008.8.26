<TITLE> Tigers look for confidence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) - After the disappointing warm-ups against the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Bangladesh would like to take some much needed confidence from their last practice game against the Northern Territory Chief Minister's XI at the Gardens Oval in Darwin Wednesday. The Tigers lost three of the four matches against the AIS but more than the results it was the inability of the bowlers to make an impression that has worried the coaching staff. Bangladesh bowlers had taken just 18 AIS wickets in the four games and have repeatedly conceded a run every ball, according to a report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "It is a worry as you have to take wickets early on and also keep the runs down. If the opposition is 120 in 20 overs then it is almost impossible to get back in the game. We have not hit the right areas and have some work to do before the internationals," said coach Jamie Siddons while speaking to local reporters during the Tigers' training at the Marrara Oval in the morning. Siddons nevertheless believes his bowlers will be back especially after watching pacers Shahadat Hossain and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza hold their own in adverse situations. "Shahadat delivered rockets according to the AIS batsmen and he has been world class. We have a world class bowler in Mortaza and some good spinners. I think they'll be up for it when the ODIs start. Afterall we are here to play international games and not practice matches," Siddons said. Vice captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza felt everything was not lost in the practice games. "We had some very good practice against a strong team," said Mortaza adding: "All of our main batsmen got runs at some point. Apart from the last match we made 270, 288 and 316 and that's very encouraging." Mortaza, one of the three survivors in the present squad from the team that defeated Australia at Cardiff in 2005 was also asked whether another fairytale was possible for the Tigers. "I have to say yes because we have done it before. Whatever the results may be I can say this much that if every player is able to give his hundred percent then we will compete against Australia. We are all keyed up for the big games." Siddons also thought the Cardiff win would act as a fillip. "Every now and then the boys who were there pull my leg by reminding me of that win as I was a coach of the Australian team at that time. I am sure they all are eagerly waiting for the series to start." The match against the Chief Minister's XI, who have in their ranks Western Australia fast bowler Trent Kelly, will start at 10:00am Darwin time (6:30am BST). In a bid to keep him fresh for the ODI series Bangladesh might rest Shahadat who has created quite an impression in Darwin through his pace and hostility.
