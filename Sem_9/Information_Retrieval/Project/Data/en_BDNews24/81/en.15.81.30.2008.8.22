 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Indian border guards have ironed out ways to curb border shootings between their forces, a senior BDR officer said on Friday. "We have found effective ways to stop shootings on the border," said Col Md Anisuzzaman, director at BDR headquarters (Operations), at the end of the second day of a border conference between Bangladesh Rifles and India's Border Security Force (BSF). Col Anisuzzaman, however, would not enlarge on the ways, saying chiefs of the two forces would brief reporters Sunday afternoon on the outcome. The conference began in Dhaka Thursday to discus a number of unresolved issues. Anisuzzaman said the talks were held in a friendly environment and were positive. BDR director general Shakil Ahmed is leading the 22-member Bangladesh delegation while his BSF counterpart Ashish Kumar Mitra is heading a 19-member Indian team at the conference at BDR headquarters in Peelkhana. The agenda includes curbing smuggling and drug peddling, and preventing illegal border crossings. India and Bangladesh share a 4,096 km border, of which 2,979 km covers land and 1,116 km river border areas. bdnews24.co
