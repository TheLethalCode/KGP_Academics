<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com) - Chittagong witnessed a hillslide Saturday in the heart of the port city, though no casualties were reported as the area had been evacuated ahead of time, an official said. Part of the prominent Batali hill, the city's tallest, collapsed Saturday afternoon, damaging a number of temporary structures on the slopes and at the foot of the hill. Local ward councillor Monwara Begum Moni told bdnews24.com, after visiting the spot: "A top portion of Batali hill, in the city's Khulshi area, collapsed at around 4.30pm." "Some shanties were damaged. But the people living in the slums on the slopes of the hill were evacuated earlier. As a result there was no casualty." The city's highest hill also houses Chittagong's liberation war memorial "Bijoy Sthambha". The memorial remained unharmed. Ward councillor Moni said the hill collapse might have been causes by tremors that hit Chittagong Friday midnight. A total of 11 people died when Tankir Pahar, a hill in the Matijharna area near Batali hill, collapsed last week. More than 100 people were killed in hillslides in Chittagong last year. bdnew
