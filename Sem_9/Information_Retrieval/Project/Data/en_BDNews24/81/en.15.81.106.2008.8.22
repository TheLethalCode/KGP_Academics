 SRINAGAR, India, Fri Aug 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Waving green Islamic flags and shouting "we want freedom", tens of thousands of Muslims marched in Indian Kashmir's main city on Friday, resuming some of the biggest protests in two decades against Indian rule. Hundreds of lorries and buses brought the protesters, many of them sitting on roofs and hanging out of windows, for an independence rally to be addressed by separatist leaders. "La illaha ill Allah (There is no god but Allah)" and "Indian forces go back," the protestors shouted. Policemen and soldiers dressed in battle gear patrolled the streets as marchers arrived from nearby towns and villages. "Pakistan se rishta kya? La illaha ill Allah. (What is our relation with Pakistan? There is no god but Allah)," some of the protesters cried, calling for the region's secession to Muslim Pakistan. What began as a dispute over land for Hindu pilgrims visiting a shrine in Kashmir snowballed into full-scale ant-India protests this month, boosting separatists who want India's only Muslim-majority region to secede. Police have killed at least 23 Muslim protesters and over 500 been injured in clashes in two weeks of demonstrations in Kashmir valley. Protests were halted for three days, until Friday, to allow Kashmiris to stock up on rations. The demonstrations were some of the biggest since a separatist revolt against Indian rule broke out in the region in 1989. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the revolt. "We appeal to people to march to Eidgah (ground), to remember and pay homage to martyrs," a joint statement of Kashmiri separatists said. "And to protest Indian occupation and pray for Kashmir's secession." Eidgah, a sprawling ground for mass Eid prayers, lies in downtown Srinagar adjacent to a "Martyrs Graveyard", a cemetery where militants and civilians are among those buried. The row over whether some forest land should be given to a Hindu shrine trust has pitted Muslims in the Kashmir valley against Hindus in Jammu, the two main regions that make up the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dispute began after the state government promised to give forest land to the Hindu trust that runs the cave shrine of Amarnath. Many Muslims were enraged, leading the state government to rescind its decision. That in turn angered Hindus in Jammu, where thousands have protested the revocation of the land order and criticised the government for "pandering to separatists". At least 10 people have also been killed in nearly two months in Jammu, where Hindus attacked lorries carrying supplies to the Kashmir valley and often blocked the region's highway, the only surface link with the rest of India. Kashmiri Muslims, challenging what they said was an economic blockade, then took to the streets to protest. Those protests have also raised tensions between Pakistan and India. Both claim the Himalayan region in full but rule it in parts and have fought two of their three wars over it. Islamabad says it lends moral support to the separatist revolt, but New Delhi insists Pakistan backs militants, and has also criticized its neighbor for interfering in its internal affairs by calling for a UN intervention. A slew of bomb attacks on Indian targets last month and the Kashmir protests have also threatened a four-year-old peace process between the nuclear-armed rivals that helped bring down violence levels in Kashmir. But people are still killed in daily shootouts and occasional bomb attacks. On Friday, two militants and an Indian soldier were killed in a gun battle near the de facto border with Pakistan
