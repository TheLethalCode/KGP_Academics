<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission has yet to receive any case files of politicians from the Anticorruption Commission or the National Coordination Committee against corruption and serious crimes, the TAC chairman said on Wednesday. The TAC has so far received records of about 182 cases, filed against 184 people, Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said at a press briefing in his Hare Road Office. Most of the case files the TAC has received so far involve graft charges against officials of the Rural Electrification Board, Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd, Roads and Highways Department, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd, Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, Department of Land Registration, Forest Department, Chittagong Port and Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. Only two cases involve businessmen, while one involves the principal of a college. Khan said fifteen out of a total of 23 forms issued by the commission so far have been submitted. The 15 applications for clemency will be heard on Sept 1. Asked why he thought no records of politicians had been sent by the ACC or NCC, the TAC chief avoided a direct reply, but answered that the bar for graft convicts from contesting polls might be a reason behind politicians staying away from the commission. According to electoral laws, people convicted of crime would not be eligible for contesting any election for five years. Justice Khan pointed out that people facing graft cases could apply to the Truth and Accountability Commission at any point before charges were framed against them in a court. But those who deposited their illegally gotten gains to the state coffers would also be eligible for clemency by the TAC, he added. Members of the commission, retired major general Manzur Rashid Khan and Asif Ali, were present at the press briefing. bdnew
