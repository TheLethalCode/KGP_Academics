 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)Textile industry leaders are warning of possible workers' unrest due to unpaid wages, as disruptions in gas supply have hampered production in many factories across the country. "Inadequate gas supply for the last three to four months has left hundreds of factories that use gas generators witness to power shortages," Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) president Abdul Hai Sarkar said at a press conference Monday. He said industries were failing to meet their export deadlines due to the crisis, which is also hampering the country's export earnings "[The factories] may face difficulties in paying their workers wages and bonuses before Eid due to the gas crisis and resulting production losses," the BTMA chief said. Replying to reporters' queries, Sarkar ruled out any possibility of adopting the government's gas rationing proposals. BTMA leaders, in a joint press statement issued at the press briefing, criticised the government's decision to keep industries shut for 5 hours a day to save power during the month of Ramadan, saying the move would bring disaster in the country's economy. BTMA vice president Jahangir Alamin called the government's management in this regard "faulty". "In the wake of this gas crisis, the government must find which sectors need to be prioritised for gas and power supplies." Replying to queries, former adviser and BTMA director Tapan Chowdhury said they need clear instructions from the government. The government is campaigning for more investment against a backdrop of poor infrastructural support, said Tapan Chowdhury of Square Textiles. "We need to know what we are to do. Should we go for further investment or try and keep a hold of what we already have?"
