<TITLE> China's Games dazzle, but not all seduced </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It has been an intricately choreographed display of might, modernity, and money, of athletics and architecture. China's Olympics have dazzled the world, and been a $43 billion exercise in public relations, on an unprecedented scale. Athletes have marvelled at state-of-the-art facilities, visitors have been overwhelmed by the warmth of the welcome, and viewers have been astounded by the image of a cosmopolitan and sophisticated China. Sport has dominated the agenda, and China has topped the medals table. Human rights concerns have been pushed to the sidelines and the clouds of pollution blown away. Yet not everyone has been seduced. Enough jarring notes have sounded to spoil the symphony, critics say, if you listen closely enough. "Brand China has done an outstanding job of repackaging itself, with the help of the American media," said Eli Portnoy, an American branding consultant. "The vast majority of Americans have been dazzled right from the opening ceremony. "Something that would have taken four or five years, they did it in 17 days," he said. The decision to give China the Games had been a controversial one, and had at one point had seemed disastrous. Riots broke out in Tibet and prompted a massive crackdown, world leaders threatened to boycott the opening ceremony and athletes complained they would choke in the Beijing smog. The spotlight shone on China, and the world did not seem to like what it saw. And yet, as the Games unfolded, enthusiasm largely got the better of cynicism. The air literally cleared, too, as measures to close factories and keep cars off the roads helped the capital enjoy its cleanest atmosphere in a decade. In April, 43 percent of Americans thought staging the Olympics in China was a "bad decision", Pew Global Research found, while roughly the same number approved. A few days into the Games, opinion had swung in China's favour -- a slim majority now approved and just 31 percent said it had been a bad idea. DAZZLED BUT NOT SEDUCED Despite the dazzle, though, not everyone has been convinced by China's refashioned image. Portnoy says he felt uncomfortable with the relentlessly positive coverage the Games was given by broadcasters in the United States, and especially by rights holders NBC. Even when the father-in-law of the U.S. volleyball coach was stabbed and killed in Beijing, the American media markedly downplayed the incident, several analysts said. "NBC has a ton of money invested, advertisers have a ton of money invested," Portnoy said. "They don't want a blemish to surface. There are too many millions at stake, and everyone's got their hand in the till." The print media was perhaps less forgiving and forgetful. Protests may have been successfully suppressed, but China's political touch was not always sure. The sight of goosestepping soldiers carrying the Olympic flag disturbed some sensibilities at the opening ceremony. Public imagination was stirred more vigorously when it emerged that a young girl had lip-synched a key song at that ceremony because the original singer was not pretty enough. Then, China acknowledged that children who were dressed in ethnic costumes were not actually from those ethnic groups, an embarrassing admission considering the troubled relations some of those groups have with the government. Britain's Financial Times said the controversies undermined the image of a modern, dynamic China and reinforced the view of the Beijing government as "control freaks". At the behest of Olympics' organisers, authorities officially licensed three public parks around Beijing as protest sites. Unfortunately they did not license any protests, turning away at least 77 applications. Two ladies, both over 70, were sentenced to a year's re-education for pushing their protest application too vigorously. Because of their age, they were allowed to serve the sentence outside a designated re-education camp. In an editorial on Saturday, the New York Times criticised Beijing's "Bad Faith Olympics", and said the final gold medal -- "for authoritarian image management" should be awarded to China's Communist Party leadership. "Beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular. It reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and, we fear, further tighten its grip at home," it said. "It pocketed these gains without offering any concessions in return." At Human Rights Watch in Washington, Asia advocacy director Sophie Richardson was similarly unimpressed. "The image that people have come away with internationally is of incredible athletes, great architecture -- and a kind of creepy government," she said.
