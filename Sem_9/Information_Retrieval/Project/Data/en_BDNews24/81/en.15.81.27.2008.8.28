<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and some other political parties, and a family of a slain national leader killed inside jail in 1975 have rejected the High Court verdict in the Jail Killing Case. The High Court on Thursday acquitted four of the 12 life convicts of the charges and two of the three death convicts in the case that involves assassination of the four national leaders of the provisional Bangladesh government at Mujibnagar in Nov 3, 1975. Rajshahi mayor-elect Khairuzzaman Liton, son of AHM Quamrauzaman, one of the four close associates of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, expressed deep resentment against the verdict. "The verdict has disappointed me and my family members. We reject the verdict," Liton told bdnews24.com. "We had also rejected the verdict of the trial court. We expected justice from the High Court. But the High Court also disappointed us," he said. Liton said that they would move the Supreme Court. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman was upset with the judgement. "The verdict has disappointed us. We wanted justice from the High Court, but we did not get it. Killing inside jail is a very sad matter," he told bdnews24.com. "The acquittal of the convicts who had killed the four national leaders so brutally will encourage criminal activities in the country," he said. Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said, "This verdict does not seem appropriate to us. It did not seem logical to me to ignore what has taken place with the knowledge of all. "I think if justice could not be ensured in such killings the politics of killing would continue in the country." Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim said the High Court verdict did not reflect real justice. "It need not be said that the verdict did not do justice to the case. The killers definitely were involved with their local and foreign patrons. Otherwise, it would not be possible for them to enter an well-protected area like jail and continue the killing spree for a long time." Selim said, "Through this verdict there is an attempt to prove that a supernatural force was behind the killings. We waged movement in the past for justice in the case; if necessary we will do so in the future." bdnews24.com
