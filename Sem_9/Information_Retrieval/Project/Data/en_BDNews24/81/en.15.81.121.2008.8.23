 Brahmanbaria, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Four power generation units at the crucial Ashuganj thermal plant were back in operation Saturday after seven units had stopped functioning due to an explosion Friday night, an official said. A tube of the steam turbine unit ruptured Friday night at around 8 pm, leaving the seven units unable to generate power. The explosion stopped power supply to Brahmanbaria and neighbouring districts. Gas Turbine (GT) units 1 and 2, both of them capable of generating 35 megawatts of power each, resumed operation early Saturday; GT unit 4, capable of producing 140 MW became operational around 9 am; 135 megawatt capacity unit 5 became operational at around 1pm Saturday, the plant's managing director Abdul Khaleque said. The four units were now supplying 405 MW power to the national grid, he added. Ashuganj power station chairman Rezwan Ahmed and Power Development Board member Mortuza Ali visited the plant in the morning and ordered immediate steps for a quick resumption of all closed units. The seven units together produce 501 megawatts power. Ashuganj power plant resumed power generation with all eight units on Aug 13 after two and a half years. A two-member enquiry committee has been formed, with general manager of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Rafiqul Alam as convenor. It has been directed to submit a report on the causes of the explosion within 72 hours. bdnews24.com/
