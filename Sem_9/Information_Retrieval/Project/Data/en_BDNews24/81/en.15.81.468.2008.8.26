 Permetang Puah, Malaysia, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters, chanting "reformasi", cheered Malaysian opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, as he voted in a key by-election on Tuesday hoping to break the government's lock on power. Anwar, whose campaign has been overshadowed by charges he sodomised a male aide, is standing in a seat in rural Permatang Pauh in the northern state of Penang in what he says is the first step to ending the Barisan Nasional's 50-year reign. Most commentators say that Anwar will win the vote, but the question is whether he can win by a sufficient margin so as to emerge as the formal leader of the three-party opposition coalition and so mount a challenge to Barisan. "It's too early to say, when in any election the important thing is to win, but here because the election is critical I have to face the entire government machinery," Anwar told reporters as supporters chanted "reformasi" (reform), the battlecry of his campaign against corruption and nepotism that he launched a decade ago. "So, it is just not Anwar versus the candidates but Anwar versus the Malaysian government, the ruling parties and all the excesses you can think of," he said after he cast his vote. Hundreds of riot police were stationed outside the polling station separating rival groups of Anwar and government supporters and one of Anwar's backers was arrested as he tried to cross the police line. Around 4,000 riot police have been deployed in the sleepy constituency to prevent clashes after what has been a divisive and bitter campaign in which Anwar's supporters have alleged voting fraud. There have been no polls of voting intentions in the election which pits Anwar and his three-party coalition against the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party in a coalition that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957. A survey of ethnic Malays by the independent Merdeka Center for Opinion Research showed that less than a third of ethnic Malays, who account for 70 percent of Permatang Pauh's 58,459 voters, believed the sodomy allegations. Anwar, 61, has been found guilty of sodomy before and was imprisoned on that charge and a count of corruption in the late 1990s and then barred from office until April this year. Anwar, who will appear in court on September 10, denies the charges. He says they are the product of a conspiracy to discredit him and scuttle his ambition to dismantle Malaysia's ethnically based economic system, root out corruption and reform the economy to boost economic growth. "I voted for Anwar because I think he can look after the interests of Malays and other races," said factory worker Mat Zaki Din, 52, after casting his vote. "I am not bothered about the sodomy case," he said. INFLATION, MALAY RIGHTS Economic concerns, at a time when inflation in this Asian country of 27 million people has surged to 27-year highs, top the agenda for most people and some are also worried about the erosion of Malay rights if Anwar wins. Political uncertainty has unnerved markets pushing the Malaysian ringgit to 9-month lows and the benchmark Malaysian equity index to a 2008 low. Political commentators say Anwar has to match the 13,000-plus majority his wife achieved to emerge as a credible leader of the three-party opposition coalition, comprising Islamists, ethnic Chinese as well as reformers. His wife vacated the seat for her husband to run. "The (Merdeka) survey results would suggest that Anwar will not lose but he may not do exceptionally well either," commentator Joceline Tan wrote in Tuesday's Star newspaper. Assuming Anwar wins, his next challenge will be garnering the support of 30 government legislators in a parliamentary vote of confidence that he has said he will call in September. Anwar needs the support of the additional 30 lawmakers to take control of the 222-seat parliament. The Barisan Nasional coalition, in which UMNO is the leading party, has said its MPs will not desert the government, which was rocked in general elections in March when it lost its two-thirds majority.
