<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Muktijoddha Sangsad KC went 2-0 down against Farashganj Sporting Club in the Citycell Federation Cup Saturday, and are to clash in the quarterfinals against Mohammedan Sporting Club at Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) Tuesday. With the three straight triumphs, Victoria emerged group champions to play against Group D runners-up Arambagh KS in the first quarterfinal Monday. Away in Gazipur Stadium, a 57th-minute strike from Tariqul Islam gave Khulna Abahani a 1-0 win over Dhaka Wanderers Club and threw Muktijoddha Sangsad into the last eight, turning the Muktijoddha and Farashganj match into a insignificant one. But it was apparently a clash to avoid favourite Mohammedan in the quarterfinals, and Farashganj comprising a bunch of young footballers came out successful dominating the depleted Muktijoddha Sangsad. Captain Kabir Hossain and striker Enamul Haque struck one goal in each half. Both the teams started the match in a great pace, but Farashganj took possession in the midfield the match progressed and went ahead in the ninth minute with a strike from Kabir. Kabir drove a low shot outside the box and it struck home with a deflection of Muktis defender Bipul Barman, and though goalkeeper Nizam jumped to his left, he failed to stop the ball. Rokonuzzaman Khanchan got into a better position thrice before the break, but the veteran striker failed to capitalise on the opportunities frustrating the freedom fighters' side. Tajul Islam set Khanchan inside the box in the 20th minute, but he took time in the box and Farashganj defender Mamun Mia cleared the ball at the cost of a corner while eight minutes later unmarked Khanchan set up by Tajul failed to connect a through pass. Khanchan then headed a cross narrowly wide before Enamul rattled the Muktijoddha Sansad post in the 32nd minute. Capitalising on a mistake by Muktijoddha goalkeeper Nizam, Emanul hammered a powerful shot from the edge of the box to force Nizam to palm the ball onto the sidebar. Enamul, however, sealed the match seven minutes from time.
