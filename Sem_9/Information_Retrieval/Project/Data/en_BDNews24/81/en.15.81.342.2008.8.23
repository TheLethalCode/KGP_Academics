 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele sprinted to victory in the 5,000 metres on Saturday to become the first man to complete the Olympic long-distance double since 1980. The 26-year-old, who retained his 10,000 title last Sunday, raced home in an Olympic record time of 12 minutes 57.82 seconds to clinch his first major 5,000m gold and match the double of compatriot Miruts Yifter in Moscow 28 years ago. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge was unable to follow Bekele when the world record-holder broke for home after the bell and finished second in 13.02.80. His compatriot Edwin Cheruiyot Soi took bronze in 13.06.22. Bekele, who won silver in Athens four years ago, gave Ethiopia a sweep of the long-distance events at the Games after Tirunesh Dibaba sealed the women's double on Friday
