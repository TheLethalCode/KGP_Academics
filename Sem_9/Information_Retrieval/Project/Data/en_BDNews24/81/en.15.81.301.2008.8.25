 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)Icelandic president Olafur Ragner Grimson, scheduled to arrive in Dhaka Tuesday, has pushed back his visit by three days, the foreign adviser said. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Monday: "The president of Iceland's Bangladesh visit has been rescheduled. He is arriving on Aug 29, instead of Aug 26." The adviser said Grimson, who is visiting Dhaka to attend climate change talks, would remain in the country until Sept 1. He is likely to address the closing session of the 'International Symposium on Climate Change and Food Security', a six-day event being held at Hotel Sonargaon and jointly organised by Dhaka University, Ohio State University, the World Meteorological Organisation, UNESCAP, and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. . Both Bangladesh and Iceland, though very different in climate, will be greatly affected by global warming, said Iftekhar. "We value our relations with Nordic countries, including Iceland," added the adviser, who is expected to meet president Grimson during his visit. bdn
