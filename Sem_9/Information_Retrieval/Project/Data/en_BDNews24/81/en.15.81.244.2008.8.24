 Analysis John Whitesides DENVER, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. Democrat Barack Obama chose seasoned experience over a fresh face in making Joseph Biden his running mate on Saturday, hoping to broaden his appeal with a pragmatic selection that props up his biggest weaknesses and signals a tougher line against rival John McCain. Biden adds foreign policy heft and a Washington insider's resume to a Democratic White House ticket headed by Obama, 47, a first-term Illinois senator dogged by questions about his readiness to be commander in chief.

His 2008 campaign got off to a rocky start when he described Obama as "articulate and bright and clean" -- comments viewed as patronizing to a black candidate. "His brain is an asset, but his mouth is a major liability. When the latter starts trumping the former, and it inevitably will, the Democrats will have a problem on their hands," Republican consultant Kevin Madden said.
