 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  National Sports Council chairman General Moeen U Ahmed has warned against corruption and politics in sports. "No politics will be allowed in the stadiums. Only sports and related activities will be allowed there. Vibrancy must be restored in the sports arena to build a drugs-free society," he told officials of Nokhali District Sports Association at Noakhali Circuit House on Friday. General Moeen, also the army chief, stressed on regular sports competition and training for the players in schools and colleges. "Efficient coaches have to be hired for creating good players. Every sports federation and sports body will have to give emphasis on training." He said there were 38 sport federations who had no remarkable success to show for and asked players, sports enthusiasts, organisers and officials to work together. The army chief said repair and development work of 16 stadiums would be done at a cost of Tk 26.34 crore through the National Sports Council. Deputy Commissioner and president of Nokhali DSA Abdul Haque presided over the meeting, attended, among others, by vice president of the DSA Moniurzzaman Chowdhury, general secretary Shamsul Hasan Miron, member Abu Taher Bacchu, and assistant general secretary Rafiqullah Akhter Milon.
