 COLOMBO, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's seamers destroyed the Sri Lankan batting to fashion out a 33-run victory in the third one-day international on Sunday. On a seaming pitch, Sri Lanka's batsmen found run making a difficult task and succumbed to 204 all out in 49 overs chasing India's total of 237 for nine. The win gave India a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India's three-pronged seam attack of Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel made full use of the conditions under lights to cause a Sri Lankan top order collapse. They bowled in good areas forcing the batsmen to commit errors as Sri Lanka slumped to 59 for six by the 18th over. Only skipper Mahela Jayawardene stood tall scoring an elegant 94 off 111 balls with six fours and a six as wickets fell around him. He was caught by Kumar off Patel. Khan was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets for 23. Jayawardene needed someone to stay with him if he was to turn the game on its head but found only Thilan Thushara (30) willing to hang around long enough to partner him in a stand of 81 off 102 balls, the highest of the match. Half-centuries from Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina steered India to 237 for nine after they had won the toss and decided to bat first. Raina and Dhoni shared a fifth-wicket stand of 54 off 45 balls after India had lost their way and were struggling at 91 for four in the 23rd over. Raina went on to score 53 off 80 balls, including one six and four fours, before being run out because of a misunderstanding with his captain. Dhoni, who made 76, forged another useful partnership with Rohith Sharma (32) that produced 67 off 39 balls for the sixth wicket to enable India to reach 212 in the 46th over. The fourth match of the series is on Tuesday at the same venue
