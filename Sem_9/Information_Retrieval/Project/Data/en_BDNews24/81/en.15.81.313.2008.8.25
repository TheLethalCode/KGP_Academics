 Chittagong, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Over one thousand employees of Chittagong City Corporation stopped work and held demonstrations on Monday, to press for a number of demands including job security and pay rises. The workers observed a token hunger strike and held a rally at the city corporation grounds from 9am. Kotwali police chief Shah Alam said they were holding their procession peacefully; sufficient police were being deployed at the corporation grounds. Action would be taken if the protesters took their protest out of the corporation grounds, he added. However, the protestors withdrew their programme in the afternoon following assurances by acting city mayor Manjur Alam that their demands would be addressed. Alam told bdnews24.com, "The monthly general meeting of the corporation today discussed the issue of increasing salaries of temporary workers." He said that the workers' demands would be fulfilled through legal measures, and making the jobs of some workers and employees permanent was already under process Temporary workers of CCC were demonstrating for job permanence and wage hikes on Monday, while permanent workers joined them with demands for job promotions. Workers' representatives and top CCC officials sat in a meeting around 12.30 pm. Garbage truck driver Abdul Munaf told bdnews24.com that he had been serving the corporation on a temporary basis for over 14 years for a daily wage of just Tk 150. "The pay is too low to maintain a family with prices mounting," he said. "We want the authorities to make our jobs permanent and give bonuses or we will continue our protest," Munaf added. Assistants to the garbage truck driers and street cleaners are demanding their pay be raised to Tk 150 a day from Tk 120. The temporary workers were also demanding their salaries on the first day of the month instead of the tenth. CCC Sramik Karmachari Unnayan Parishad president Kazi Abu Tayab told bdnews24.com Monday morning that a committee had been formed to make the workers' jobs permanent, but the authorities were not implementing the measure. "Whenever we take to the streets the mayor and commissioners hold meetings and pledge to meet our demands. But they stop there," Tayab said. "This time we will continue our movement until all our demands are met," he said. Tayab later relented, however, and said the workers would halt their move if the mayor assured them that their demands would be met. bdnew
