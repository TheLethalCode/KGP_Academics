 BAGHDAD Thu Aug 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Iraq are close to a deal extending the presence of US troops beyond 2008, but any timetable for their withdrawal must be `feasible', US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Thursday. Rice, who flew to Baghdad on an unannounced visit, denied reports that the deal has already been reached but said it was close and she was hoping to learn from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki if there were any more tricky issues to resolve. "It is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very, very far toward an end agreement, but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today," she told reporters on board her plane. "But I will have a chance with the prime minister to really know if there are any other gaps that we have to close from Washington." The long-awaited agreement will allow US forces to stay in Iraq beyond the end of this year, when a UN Security Council mandate enacted after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 expires. Replacing the UN mandate with a formal US-Iraqi pact is seen as a milestone in Iraq's emergence as a sovereign state, giving Baghdad direct say over the presence of foreign troops on its soil for the first time since the fall of Saddam Hussein. But the deal's terms are politically sensitive in both countries, with Maliki determined to show that the 144,000 US troops will not stay longer than needed, and US President George W Bush keen to avoid a firm schedule for them to leave. "We are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done, what's feasible," Rice said. "Obviously everybody is going to keep an eye on conditions on the ground." DRAFT Iraqi officials have said they would like to see U.S. forces cease routine patrols on Iraqi streets by the middle of next year and withdraw all combat troops by 2010 or 2011. But it is not clear how explicit such language would be in the agreement. Iraq's chief negotiator Mohammed al-Haj Hamoud told Reuters on Wednesday a draft of the agreement was complete and would be presented to Iraqi political leaders to approve and send to parliament. He said the draft did not include withdrawal dates. A commitment to withdraw combat troops in 2010 would resemble the plan offered by US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who wants them out by mid-2010. The Bush administration and Republican candidate John McCain say troop reductions are likely but they do not want to commit to a firm timetable. The administration began speaking in July of "time horizons" and "aspirational goals" for withdrawal. Other issues that need to be sorted out include immunity for US troops from Iraqi law and the status of prisoners held by American forces. US forces hold some 21,000 prisoners in Iraq they deem dangerous but have not charged with any crime. Rice said she would also discuss Iraq's failure to enact an election law to allow provincial polls due on October 1 to take place on time. The election law was held up in parliament because of a dispute between Kurds and other groups over how to run the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, despite strong US pressure for Iraqi politicians to reach a deal
