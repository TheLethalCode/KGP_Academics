 Andrew Cawthorne BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With the Games heading into its last full day, Argentina, China and Ethiopia were in the spotlight Saturday. Argentina gained another soccer title, China closed towards the first sweep of Olympic diving titles in more than half a century, and Ethiopian long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele was attempting to be the first man since 1980 to win both 5,000 and 10,000 meters in the penultimate day of the Olympics. Argentina retained the Olympic gold medal in soccer by beating Nigeria 1-0 in Saturday's final with a stunning goal from Angel Di Maria. Di Maria, guilty of a remarkable double penalty-miss in a group game against Serbia, broke clear of the Nigeria defence and clipped the ball over Ambruse Vanzekin in the 58th minute. Wilting in the searing heat, the Argentines survived a torrid half hour of Nigerian pressure to cling on for victory. The mid-day showdown at the Bird's Nest was a repeat of the 1996 final, which Nigeria won 3-2 to become the first African team to win the tournament. Governing body FIFA, wary of creating a rival to its own World Cup, restricts the Olympic tournament to under 23 year olds, with each team permitted three overage players. Jamaica's Usain "Lightning" Bolt lit up the Bird's Nest on Friday night, taking a third gold in the men's 4x100 meters relay after his individual sprint double. All three victories have come in world record time. "All I can say is yo, Jamaican sprinters (are) taking over the world," Bolt said after his final race. Ethiopia's Bekele is the man to watch on the track on day 15 of the Games. He retained his 10,000m title last weekend and now needs his first major 5,000m gold to equal compatriot Miruts Yifter's long-distance double 28 years ago. In the usual east African running rivalry, Bekele's toughest competition comes from a trio of Kenyans and their former compatriot Bernard Lagat, now running for the United States. With 32 golds up for grabs on Saturday, the first went to Germany's Sabine Spitz in the cross-country mountain bike race. She had time to grab a flag and wave as she finished with a 40-second lead. Two favorites dropped out, the heat and tough course seemingly taking their toll. UNSTOPPABLE CHINA China have had a fabulous Olympics, and Zhou Luxin is favored to take the last diving gold, in the 10m platform, to give the hosts clean sweep of all eight diving medals. "Everyone who has come before me has done their duty, so I have to make an extra effort," said Zhou. With the last 12 golds of the Beijing Olympics to be awarded on Sunday, China is now assured top spot in the overall table. The hosts have 47 golds to 31 for the United States. Britain have a surprising 18 golds, their best performance in a century. China's position on top of the medal table was widely predicted, given their strength at events like diving and table-tennis, but the size of the gap has surprised many. With one fifth of the world's population to choose from, Chinese authorities have poured billions into a Soviet-style training system geared to maximizing medals. Their new sporting superpower status reflects their emerging global economic might. As the Olympic flag is lowered at Sunday's closing ceremony and passed to 2012 hosts Britain, China will feel the $43 billion investment on the Games was money well spent. Despite a buildup dominated by talk of pollution and human rights, attention during the Games has focused on China's dazzling venues and the scintillating sport inside them. The individual standouts have been Bolt and American swimmer Michael Phelps, who won eight gold medals to become the most successful athlete in the history of the Games. Despite some small protests over Tibet, a couple of militant attacks in west China around the start of the Games, and the murder of a U.S. tourist, little has distracted from the sport. A record number of nations, 85, have taken medals, including, for the first time, conflict-riven Afghanistan whose taekwondo bronze winner Rohullah Nikpai was rewarded with a house. American team leaders have called for a post mortem into their disappointing showing after they failed to win a sprint gold in an unboycotted Games for the first time since 1976. They were not in the finals of Friday's 4x100m relays after embarrassingly dropping the baton in men's and women's heats. There was disappointment for the United States too in baseball, where perennial rival Cuba knocked them out in the semi-finals and now face surprise package South Korea at Wukesong Field for gold. That will be the last game before baseball is axed from the Olympics programme. Boxing, where Cuba is also strong, reaches a climax on Saturday and Sunday but has again been dogged by controversy. The International Boxing Association (AIBA) is investigating allegations of manipulation following claims by a Romanian official that the assignment of judges and referees was not fair.
