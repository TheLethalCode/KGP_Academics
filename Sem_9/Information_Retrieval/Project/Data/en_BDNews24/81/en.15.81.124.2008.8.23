 Sunamganj, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed stressed Saturday that the government's main aim in leasing out water bodies was not to generate revenue but for the development of fishery resources. "The fisheries sector has a big role in the country's socio-economic development by fulfilling the nutritional demand," Fakhruddin said. At a discussion with community leaders in Sunamganj, following his inauguration of the Fish Resources Development Drive 2008, the chief adviser said development of fish resources could go a long way to ensuring adequate supplies of protein for the people. The sector also creates employment opportunities, he said. He pointed out that government policy for development of water bodies had advanced considerably, and would be finalised based on further input from experts. The weeklong Fish Resources Development Drive began on Saturday across the country, with the chief adviser formally launching the programme by releasing fish fry in Sunamganj's Surma river. This year's drive has the theme: "If fish resources are protected, food and money are guaranteed". President Iajuddin Ahmed in a message also underlined the potential of such resources, pointing out that the fisheries sector was not only playing a very significant role in meeting the protein demand of the country but also boosting foreign exchange earnings. "Everybody should come forward spontaneously for its development," he said. A similar message was released from the chief adviser's office. Fakhruddin also assured those present at the later discussion: "The government is thinking of completing a tender process by December every year for maintenance of the Sunamganj haor embankment to safeguard crops from early floods." The chief adviser also touched on the subject of elections: "It is the responsibility of the government to ensure such an environment that people can exercise the voting rights without fear." "The responsibility of the people is to elect efficient, honest and good people." He reiterated the caretaker government's pledge to hold Jatiya Sangsad elections by December, and said to that end a final voter list would be published soon. The caretaker chief added that the Election Commission had started work for holding upazila elections in October. The chief adviser also mentioned that the ongoing anticorruption drive would continue, adding: "Resisting corruption is a social movement and the strategy has to be adopted from the grassroots level." Sharing concerns about the state of education in Sylhet division, Fakhruddin said the demands raised locally for expansion of educational opportunities would be solved on a priority basis. "Improving the quality of overall education has become an urgent matter," he said. The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of the ministry of fisheries and livestock Manik Lal Samaddar, fisheries secretary Syed Ataur Rahman and other top officials of Sylhet division were present at the inauguration of the drive. Besides, Sylhet divisional commissioner Zafar Ahmed Khan, Sunamganj deputy commissioner Md Saber Hossain and Sunamganj Chamber of Commerce and Industries senior vice president Tozammel Haq were present at the discussion programme held after at a local auditorium. bdnews24.co
