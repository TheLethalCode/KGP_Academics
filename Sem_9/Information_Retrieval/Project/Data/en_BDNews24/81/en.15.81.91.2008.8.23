 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government has transferred another 35 upazila nirbahi officers (UNOs) in an ongoing overhaul of grassroots administration ahead of general elections. The establishment ministry issued orders relating to the transfer Saturday afternoon, resulting in the reposting of 203 out of a total 480 UNOs over three days. The interim government began the overhaul in the local administration on Thursday with the transfer of 38 deputy commissioners. As many as 141 UNOs were also transferred on Thursday and 27 on Friday. The reshuffles began within days of senior bureaucrats asking the chief adviser, at a meeting on Aug 18, to reorder local administration in preparation for parliamentary polls. The government formed a committee headed by the additional secretary at the Cabinet Division to deal with the reshuffles of local administration. bdnew
