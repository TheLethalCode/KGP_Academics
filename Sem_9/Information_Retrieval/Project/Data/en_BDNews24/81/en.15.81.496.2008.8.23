 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Concentration, technique and the ability to withstand the searing heat proved to be the keys to victory on the Olympic mountain bike course on Saturday. Julien Absalon of France and Sabine Spitz of Germany each opened commanding leads on their opponents and managed to keep them throughout multiple laps of a technically difficult course. Absalon finished more than one minute ahead of his team mate Jean-Christophe Peraud, who took silver. Spitz ended her race more than 40 seconds ahead of Maja Wloszczowska of Poland. With such big leads, Absalon and Spitz made the ride seem very easy, though it featured large boulders in the trail, steep, technical downhills on muddy terrain that caused many riders to tumble and tough uphill portions. "It's the most complicated, difficult technical race," Absalon said after securing his second straight Olympic gold. "There were lots of stones and no time to rest." "It's not really easy to be the favourite," he added. Though he had a hard time, many who finished behind Absalon just marvelled at his abilities. Christoph Sauser of Switzerland, who lost a battle for bronze against his team mate Nino Schurter, called Absalon "simply unbeatable". "Nothing surprises me with that guy," said South African rider Burry Stander. "He's the man to beat and he's proven once again that he's the king of the mountain." Spitz also made her victory look easy, but said she had to focus throughout in order not to fall or lose her line. "It was difficult to concentrate and control my opponents even when leading, so it took a lot of concentration," said Spitz, who led in all six laps in the 27 km race. "The heat was the strongest opponent," added the German. "I like the heat so maybe it was because of that that I won. It was very hard because the weather was so hot today.
