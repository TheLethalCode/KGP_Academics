 Karachi, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)-- Fast bowler Mohammad Asif will appear before a drug tribunal in India next week, Pakistani media reported Tuesday. "I had asked for some clarifications from the Indian Premier League on the doping case of Asif and would be traveling to India next week to attend a tribunal hearing," Asif's lawyer Shahid Karim was quoted as saying by The News newspaper. Asif's B sample of a drug test taken during the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition came out positive last week at the World Anti-Doping Agency's laboratory in Switzerland.

The PCB has distanced itself from Asif's latest doping case, suspending the player from all forms of cricket and indicating it will abide by the decision of the IPL tribuna
