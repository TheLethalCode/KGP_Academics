 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia won their fourth Olympic men's hockey bronze on Saturday, after their fresh and impulsive attack left reigning world champions the Netherlands looking tired and short of ideas in their 6-2 victory. Australia took the Netherlands by surprise, scoring three times within the first 10 minutes in the rematch of the 2004 Athens final, which Australia also won to take gold. The two teams drew 2-2 in their group stage match. In the fifth minute, a free hit by Australia's David Guest found Eddie Ockenden through a wall of Dutch defenders and Ockenden let the ball drop low off his stick into the goal. He scored less than a minute later, diving into a pass from the right for a deflection goal and Des Abbott scrubbed a ball through Dutch goalkeeper Guus Vogels' legs in the ninth minute. Dutch penalty corner specialist Taeke Taekema then narrowed the deficit with a trademark drag flick and veteran midfielder Teun de Nooijer got onto his knees for a deflection goal in the 27th minute, bringing the Dutch back into the game. Australia settled the half-time score at 4-2 with a Eli Matheson goal in the 28th minute. They finished off their campaign with a beautiful reverse stick slam by Rob Hammond in the 42nd minute and a powerful penalty corner flick into the top right corner by Luke Doerner. Later on Saturday, Spain clash with reigning world champions Germany in the final, with Spain eager to win their first Olympic gold and Germany keen to add a third title to their collection
