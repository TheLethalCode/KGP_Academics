 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of two breakaway BNP factions have agreed to pursue programmes together to mount pressure on authorities to release party chief Khaleda Zia from prison. Over 50 former MPs of both the factions met in Selim Reza Habib's NAM flat Sunday and decided to form a human chain on Aug 27 across the country for Khaleda's freedom and overseas medical treatment of her ailing elder son Tarique Rahman. Former state ministers Lutfar Rahman Khan Azad, ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Zafrul Islam Chowdhury, former whip Rezaul Bari Dina, Md Shahjahan, Abdul Hye, Gias Quader Chowdhury, Fazlul Haque Aspia, Habib, Mohammad Ali, Joynal Abedin Faruque, Gazi Md Shajahan Jewel, M Illias Ali, Abdul Momin Talukder, Abdul Khair Bhuiyan, Harun-or-Rashid, Illen Bhutto and Khairul Kabir Khokan were among others present at the meeting. Gazi Md Shahjahan Jewel later told reporters, "There is no conflict of interest in the BNP. We are united. Senior leaders would be united soon too." Illias Ali said, "We all former BNP MPs are united on the demand for release of Khaleda Zia and overseas treatment of Tarique." He said the former MPs were united under the leadership of Khaleda-nominated secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. On Wednesday, the MPs of both factions sat in a meeting at Shah Nurul Kabir's home. bdnews2
