 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)Awami League on Sunday was observing the fourth death anniversary of the party's former women affairs secretary Ivy Rahman, who died of injuries sustained in the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack on an AL rally in the capital. Family members and former colleagues offered flowers and prayers at her grave in Banani. Husband and acting AL president Zillur Rahman, in an emotional tribute, said: "Ivy sacrificed her own life to save our leader Sheikh Hasina on the tragic day of the grenade attack. I have hardly been able to breathe since." Zillur, repeating allegations that the then BNP-led four-party alliance government had been behind the grenade attack, demanded the caretaker government bring the culprits to book. Ivy, mortally wounded during the blasts, was admitted to Dhaka Combined Military Hospital where she died two days later. Members of Jatiya Mohila Porishad, Mohila Awami League, Jubo League and others paid respects at her grave Sunday. A milad mehfil was scheduled to be held at Zillur Rahman's Gulshan house after asr prayers. Ivy Rahman was born on July 7, 1944. Her father Jalaluddin Ahmed was the principal of Dhaka College. bdnews2
