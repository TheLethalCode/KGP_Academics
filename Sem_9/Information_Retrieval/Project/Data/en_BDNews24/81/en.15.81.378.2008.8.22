 Brahmanbaria, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  An explosion on Friday night at Ashuganj thermal power plant knocked off power supplies to Brahmanbaria, an official said. "Seven units have become unable to generate power after a tube of the steam turbine unit exploded around 8pm," said Abdul Khaleque, managing director of the power plant. Engineers at the plant were working to repair the units, he added. Ashuganj power plant with eight units resumed power generation on Aug 13 after two and a half years. The seven units produce 501 megawatts power. bdnews
