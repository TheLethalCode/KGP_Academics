 NEW DELHI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) hailed Don Bradman as "a byword for brilliance" on Wednesday, the centenary of the cricketer's birth. "No name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of Sir Donald Bradman," ICC president David Morgan said in a statement from the organisation's headquarters in Dubai. "Even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name Bradman as a byword for brilliance. "That name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket," he said. "Soccer has Pele and cricket has Bradman." Australians were paying tribute to their beloved son on Wednesday with skipper Ricky Ponting delivering the Bradman oration in Sydney. "Even now, 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context, his batting average of 99.94 still seems scarcely believable, especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level," Morgan added. Bradman also left his stamp as captain, selector and administrator and his death in 2001 prompted an outpouring of grief in Australia with the rest of the cricket world joining in to pay their tributes. He played 52 tests, scoring 6,996 runs at an astonishing average of 99.94, his 29 hundreds further testimony to his class and tenacity. "Cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and I am sure Ricky's speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person," Morgan said. "Sir Donald's life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that our strong sport continues to grow stronger.
