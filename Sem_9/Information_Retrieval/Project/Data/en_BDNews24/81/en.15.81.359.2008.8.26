<TEXT>
 DENVER, Tue Aug 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether three men arrested in Colorado with guns and drugs planned to kill Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, but said they posed no real threat. "We're absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate, the Democratic National Convention (in Denver), or the people of Colorado," US Attorney Troy Eid said in a statement. Local media reported that police in the city of Aurora east of Denver found two rifles, ammunition, a bulletproof vest, walkie-talkies and methamphetamine in a rented pickup truck driven by one of the men during a traffic stop early Sunday morning. The reports said the suspects told Aurora police they planned to shoot Obama, who would be the first black president, as he accepted the Democratic nomination for the November 4 election on Thursday at an open-air football stadium. The suspects are Tharin Gartrell, 28, Nathan Johnson, 32, and Shawn Adolf, 33, the reports said. Aurora police spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. US Attorneys office was expected to give further details at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon
