 MIAMI, Tue Aug 26(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gustav reached hurricane strength as it swirled through the central Caribbean and bore down on Haiti on Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center said. A hurricane hunter aircraft reported the storm's top sustained winds were near 80 mph (130 kph) -- above hurricane strength of 74 mph (120 kph) -- as it approached southwest Haiti. Gustav threatened the impoverished Caribbean nation of 9 million with up to 25 inches of rain in some areas, which could trigger deadly floods and mudslides. Oil prices rose as Gustav stirred concerns about disruptions to US oil and gas output in the Gulf of Mexico and served as another reminder that this storm season is shaping up to be busier than usual. At least one computer forecasting model showed the storm could enter the Gulf. A hurricane warning was issued for Haiti west of Barahona, and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez declared a partial state of emergency as the storm began dousing his country's southern coast. Gustav was about 130 miles south-southeast of Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, at 2 a.m. (0600 GMT and was moving toward the northwest at near 12 mph (19 kph), the Miami-based hurricane center said. "INTENSE RAINS" Haiti is still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, the remnants of which were causing flooding across the US southeastern states. Fay may have killed more than 50 people in Haiti last week, including dozens missing after floodwaters swept a bus down a river
