 LONDON, Thu Aug 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose by more than $4 a barrel to nearly $120 on Thursday, climbing for a third day, as Washington's missile shield deal with Poland angered Russia, adding to international tension. The spat adds to political factors that have supported oil prices in recent months, such as the dispute over Iran's nuclear work. A weaker dollar also boosted the appeal of commodities as an inflation hedge. "There's a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background -- Russia, Iran," said Tony Machacek, broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. "Also, the dollar is weaker." US crude gained $4.22 to $119.78 a barrel by 10:40 a.m. EDT, down from a high on the day of $119.99. Brent crude climbed $4.23 to $118.59. The United States and Poland signed a deal on Wednesday to station parts of a US missile defence shield on Polish soil, drawing a sharp response from Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter. The pact comes as relations between Russia and the West have been strained by Moscow's military intervention in Georgia. The conflict there has disrupted the transit of Azeri oil through Georgia. International tension outweighed a US government report that on Wednesday showed crude inventories rose by 9.4 million barrels, the largest weekly increase since March 2001. Oil has fallen from a record high of $147.27 a barrel reached last month on evidence that demand is slowing. Prices remain up about 15 percent so far this year and have climbed from below $20 in early 2002
