 DENVER, Sun Aug 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Democrat Barack Obama chose seasoned experience over a fresh face in making Joseph Biden his running mate on Saturday, hoping to broaden his appeal with a pragmatic selection that props up his biggest weaknesses. Biden adds foreign-policy heft and a Washington insider's resume to a Democratic White House ticket headed by Obama, 47, a first-term Illinois senator dogged by questions about his readiness to be commander in chief. Biden, 65, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the party's foreign-policy heavyweights, could help answer criticisms from Republican rival John McCain that Obama is too inexperienced to be trusted in the Oval Office. The verbose six-term senator from Delaware also possesses a willingness to engage in political combat that some Democrats have worried is lacking in Obama. The choice comes as Obama's campaign has turned up its attacks on McCain and polls show the Nov. 4 election tightening. "Obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on McCain, and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts," said Democratic consultant Doug Schoen, a former pollster for President Bill Clinton. Obama, who rode to the nomination with a call for change in Washington and a new approach to governing, passed up young outsiders like Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine or Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and more moderate choices like Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh. The choice of Kaine or Sebelius would have led to criticism the Democratic ticket was too inexperienced in foreign policy and national security. Bayh had aroused opposition among liberal groups unhappy with his history of non-partisan moderation and his early support for the Iraq war. Obama also passed up his vanquished rival from the primaries, Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, whose choice would have united the party but opened the door for more simmering tensions and drama than Obama apparently could stomach
