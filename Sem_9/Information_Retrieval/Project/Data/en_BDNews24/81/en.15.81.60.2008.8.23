 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts Pakistan expect England, Australia and New Zealand to join South Africa and withdraw from next month's Champions Trophy because of safety and security concerns. South Africa pulled out on Friday of the eight-nation tournament scheduled from Sept. 12-28 despite assurances from an International Cricket Council (ICC) task force that acceptable security arrangements were in place. "Four countries have now decided against coming to Pakistan. I probably shouldn't bracket the other three (England, Australia and New Zealand) with South Africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same," Pakistan Cricket Board chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi told Reuters by telephone. "We already know they have expressed their apprehensions." The ICC executive board will meet on Sunday to make a final decision on the fate of the tournament. "We know of Cricket South Africa's decision and we will not be making any further comment until the board has discussed Champions Trophy related issues on Sunday," an ICC spokesman said. Sri Lanka are the designated replacement hosts although ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat told Reuters on Tuesday it was now too late to switch the competition. Cricket South Africa president Norman Arendse said the governing body had reached its decision after extensive discussions and "a frank exchange of views" with the ICC task force headed by Lorgat, a former South Africa selector. Australia, New Zealand and England players have expressed concerns about security in Pakistan after a spate of suicide bombings. In the latest incident, 67 people were killed on Thursday in a suicide bombing outside a defence industry complex 30-km northwest of Islamabad. Last week an ICC delegation met Cricket Australia as well as skipper Ricky Ponting and vice-captain Michael Clarke. The Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) has told its members Pakistan is not safe to tour and also expressed concerns about Sri Lanka. An ACA spokeswoman said the players' union would wait for the ICC to makes its decision on Sunday. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined to comment
