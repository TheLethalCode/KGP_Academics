 KARACHI, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria has undergone finger surgery and will be sidelined for six weeks, the bowler said on Thursday. Kaneria, who plays for English county Essex, underwent the operation on Wednesday after sustaining the injury against Worcestershire which forced him to return home with one month remaining for the season to end. "There was a fracture in my right hand ring finger which I sustained while taking a caught and bowled chance," he told Reuters. "I have had the surgery to set it right," he said. "Hopefully I should be bowling again after six weeks." The 27-year-old has taken 220 wickets in 51 tests but has played just 18 one-day internationals since his debut in 2000. The leg spinner was disappointed he could not play on and reach 100 wickets for the season. He took 75 wickets in all forms of the game after joining Essex a month into the season. "Already Pakistan is not playing a test series this year and we are short of cricket," he said. "The injury has really come at a bad time." Pakistan are without a test series this year after Australia postponed a tour in March due to security concerns. The International Cricket Council (ICC) also postponed the Champions Trophy last week after several teams refused to travel to Pakistan over similar concern
