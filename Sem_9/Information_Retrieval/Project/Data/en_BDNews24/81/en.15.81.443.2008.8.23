 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An outgoing passenger plane en route to Barbados was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Britain's second biggest airport, London Gatwick, on Saturday after the flight crew decided to turn back. No one was hurt, and a spokesman for the airport's operator BAA said all the passengers were being taken off the plane. He gave no details of what had prompted the pilot to turn back. "A Boeing 747 operated by Virgin Atlantic has had a precautionary landing at the airport. It is safely down. It has been taken to a remote stand where passengers are being taken off," he told Reuters.
