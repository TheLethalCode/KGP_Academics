 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury will visit Kuwait on Sept 3-4 to discuss the labour problems with Kuwaiti authorities, said a foreign ministry press statement Wednesday. The statement said issues relating to Bangladeshi workers would feature during the adviser's talks with the Kuwaiti government. "The subject of greater economic cooperation between that wealthy Gulf state and Bangladesh, a large developing, Muslim-majority country will also come up," it said. Iftekhar, whose visit as at the invitation of Kuwaiti ministers, told bdnews24.com Monday: "During my Kuwait visit I will talk to the local Bangaldeshis there and urge them to abide by the laws of the land." The foreign adviser had earlier been in contact with three Kuwaiti ministers as thousands of Bangladeshi workers in the Gulf state went on strike in July demanding pay hikes and better working conditions. The Kuwaiti authorities deported about 1,129 Bangladeshis from the country on charges of violating local laws as demonstrations and strikes are prohibited in the country. The host country, however, raised the minimum wage of migrant workers following the protests and assured Bangladesh that it would take tough legal actions if any company failed to pay workers' wages regularly. bdn
