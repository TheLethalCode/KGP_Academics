 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said on Monday it was not possible for the party to meet the conditions for registering by Oct 15, the deadline announced earlier in the day by the Election Commission. "Meeting all the conditions for registration requires a council of the party, which is not possible to arrange amid the state of emergency," Amu told reporters at the National Press Club. Amu pointed out the party had recently sought a date from the EC and the government for discussions on such matters. "We hope a solution regarding registration will turn up through discussion." "If not, we will decide our next course of action," the AL leader said. Awami League leader Suranjit Sengupta said the party was not against registration of political parties. "But registration of parties ahead of the national election was nothing but killing time," he said. He said registration required an amendment to the party constitution which was not possible amid emergency. The Election Commission on Monday fixed Aug 27 to Oct 15 for political parties to apply for registration, a must under new electoral laws. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said the commission wanted to finalise the registration procedure by Oct 30. bdnews
