 BELGRADE, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid crushed German side Schalke 04 4-1 on aggregate to reach the Champions League proper after beating them 4-0 at home in their third qualifying round second leg on Wednesday. They were joined by former winners Liverpool and Olympique Marseille, 2006 finalists Arsenal and three teams who qualified for the lucrative group stage of the competition for the first time.
