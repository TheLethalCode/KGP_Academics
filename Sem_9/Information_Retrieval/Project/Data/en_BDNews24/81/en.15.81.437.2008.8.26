 Peshawar, Pakistan, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen fired at a US consulate vehicle carrying three staff members in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on Tuesday but there were no injuries, police and a US embassy spokesman said. Peshawar is near the border with Afghanistan, the capital of Pakistan's violence-plagued North West Frontier Province where the United States has a heavily guarded consulate. "Gunmen in a landcruiser opened fire at the car but no one was hurt," said city police official Raziq Khan. U.S. embassy spokesman Lou Fintor said there was a "security incident" involving a U.S. consulate vehicle and three employees. "There were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle," Fintor said. He declined to say who was in the vehicle but Dawn Television said one of them was the consulate's principal officer. U.S. diplomatic staff usually travel in armoured vehicles but Fintor said he did not know if the vehicle attacked on Tuesday was armoured. Bombers have tried to attack the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Karachi since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. A U.S. diplomat was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Karachi in 2006.
