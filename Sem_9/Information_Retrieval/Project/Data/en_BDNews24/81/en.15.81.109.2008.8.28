 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture takes the centre stage as the government tries to devise a new three-year strategy to tackle poverty in the country that has seen four million more plunge below the line thanks to recent price hike. The government has drafted the second poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) to cover the next three years with a target of seven percent GDP growth, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said on Wednesday. Officials say aim of the the second PRSP, with input from members of the public, is to establish a sustainable and poor-friendly economy by giving priority to agriculture sector. The adviser told bdnews24.com earlier that the Executive Committee of National Economic Council was all set to approve the PRSP for 2008-09 to 2010-11. The government will provide necessary helps to boost investment in private sector in order to develop human resources and create jobs, the adviser said. Azizul Islam said opinions from people of all walks of life contributed to the preparation of the new PRSP. The government will rely on micro-credit, food security and various social safety programmes to help the poor, according to the new strategy. The first PRSP was adopted in July 2005 during the BNP-led alliance government that expired in June. Climate change, growing risk of natural disaster, two floods in 2007 and cataclysmic Sidr influenced the new strategy, officials said. The proposed PRSP takes into account the likely natural disasters that may cause a fall in food production and soar food price on international markets. Progress of women, protecting environment, devising new technology and spreading use of information and communication technology and ensuring efficient use of government property would the key goals for the next three years. The new PRSP says 56.6 percent people of Bangladesh lived below the poverty line in fiscal 1991-92. In 2000, the percentage of people living below poverty line dropped to 48.9 percent and to 40 percent in 2005. It did not describe the situation after 2005. The World Bank, which coordinates multilateral lending for Bangladesh, said Tuesday that recent hike in daily essentials' price pushed 40 lakh people more down the poverty line. Referring to a report on poverty in Bangladesh, Vinay Swaroop, a WB economist, said poverty rate dropped five percentage points from fiscal 2005-06 to 2007-08. But the price hike of commodities increased poverty rate by three percentage points. According to Swaroop, poverty rate dropped two percent in the last three fiscal years. The Centre for Policy Dialogue in June published a report that said 8.5 percent people went down the poverty line in the last three years due to inflation.
