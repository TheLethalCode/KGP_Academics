 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday granted former prime minister Khaleda Zia four-month interim bail in Zia Orphanage Trust case. The court at the same time asked the government to explain why she should not get permanent bail. The bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Imdadul Haque Azad gave the order on a petition by the BNP chief's lawyers. "Khaleda Zia was never linked with Zia Orphanage Trust, so she may be granted bail in the case," Khaleda's lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmed said to the court. Contesting the bail prayer, advocate Anisul Haque who represented the Anticorruption Commission, said, "Khaleda Zia should not be bailed out as she stands accused of serious graft charges." Khandaker Mahbub retorted, "When one bailed out former prime minister can tour foreign countries, why should Khaleda Zia be falling behind?" Barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim, another counsel for Khaleda, said, "Besides, prayers for granting bail to Khaleda ZIa in Niko, GATCO and Barapukuria coal mine corruption cases will also be submitted in a day or two." The ACC filed the case on July 3 against Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and five others charging them with misappropriating Zia Orphanage Trust fund of Tk 2.1 crore. bdnews24.com/at/ra/wz/bd/1614 hours $$$$$$ Dhaka, Aug25, (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday granted former prime minister Khaleda Zia four-month bail in Zia Orphanage Trust case.
