 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  Private firms on Thursday began handling international phone calls under international gateway (IGW). MA Malek, special assistant to the chief adviser, inaugurated the IGW service of Mir Telecom at Eskaton in the city. Earlier, state-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, now Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited, was the sole company in the field. "We firmly believe that the government should not do business because the government hardly becomes successful in any business," Malek said. He said the government wanted to spread technology to rural areas. "We will soon launch WiMax in Bangladesh," he said. He said the state-run Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited would not face any problem because of the growth of private sector. Manzurul Alam, chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, said the government would earn Tk 1500 crore from six private operators on international calls. He said the government opened voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) service in line with the international long-distance calls policy. "BTRC has successfully implemented the policy. Illegal VoIP business will be wiped out with the launch of this service in private sector," the BTRC chief said. Malek also inaugurated International Internet Gateway service of Mango Teleservice in Mohakhali. bdne
