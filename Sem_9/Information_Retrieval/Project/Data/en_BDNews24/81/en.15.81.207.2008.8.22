 Pabna, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  RAB early Friday killed an alleged militant leader in a 'shootout' at Ataikula in Pabna, an official said. Jahurul Islam Mithhu, 32, son of Abdur Razzak of Swarogram under Ataikula Police Station, is the third militant chieftain to be liquidated in the last couple of months in the area gradually heating up with the militants flexing muscles afresh. Rab-12 Pabna camp commander Flt Lt Ahmed Faisal said the Jahurul was the regional leader of the banned Purbo Banglar Communist Party (ML-Lal Pataka). Faisal said after they were tipped off that members of the militant group had been holding a clandestine meeting at a place near Bhulbaria primary school, a RAB team had gone there at 4:30am. He claimed the alleged terrorists opened fire on them and RAB retaliated, sparking a 20-minute gunbattle which left Jahurul killed on the spot. A .22 bore revolver, a handmade gun and 10 rounds of ammunition had been retrieved from the rendezvous, the Rab officer said. He said there were at least 12 cases including eight for murder against Jahurul with different Pabna police stations. The body has been sent to Pabna sadar hospital for autopsy. bdnew
