<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is trying its best to narrow the gap with political parties, the communications adviser said Thursday. "There is no reason for the mounting distance," adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters at the Secretariat. On media reports that the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia was awaiting certain conditions, Quader said: "Her release has not been held up for any condition. We are pressing forward with that goal and we are hopeful of success." Asked whether Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman would be released if he secured bail in all the cases against him, the adviser said: "The government can not intervene in court matters." "Bail is a matter that may take time. His release would be quicker if it was done through parole," he said. On whether the country's overall political situation was extending beyond the government's control, the adviser replied: "There is nothing beyond the control of the government. Everything is under the government's control." Quader expected that a free and fair election would be held in December with the participation of all political parties. "Let us hope to see a democratic government on the first day of the next year," he said. bdne
