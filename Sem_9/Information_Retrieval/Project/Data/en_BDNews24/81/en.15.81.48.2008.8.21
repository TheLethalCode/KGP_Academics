 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  The finance adviser has asked the chief executives of state-owned commercial banks to meet targets or get ready to be fired with one month's notice in a growing sign that the government's patience is wearing thin. "The CEOs were given certain targets to achieve. As of now the banks have fulfilled their targets in most areas," AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters at the finance ministry. Still, he said, they missed the mark in some areas although the situation this year was better than it had been a year ago. State-owned commercial banks Sonali, Janata and Agrani got new CEOs after they were turned into public limited company in January. "The main problem of the three banks is classified loan. Loan repayments was not bad this year. But defaults on loan repayments have increased as well because of the 'default culture'," the adviser said. Asked if there was any drive against the defaulters, Azizul said, "Recovery of outstanding loan is the job of the banks. I've personally written several letters to the law ministry to remove complexities regarding the cases." According to Bangladesh Bank, the unpaid loan in the banking sector stood at Tk 24,997 crore as of June, Tk 2,700 crore up from Tk 22,302 crore a year ago. Agrani Bank was made a public limited company in line with the advice of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) much earlier than Sonali and Janata Bank were. Sonali and Janata became PLC at the end of last year. The finance adviser is holding meetings with the officials of these three banks to evaluate how much of the target has been achieved. Earlier, the finance adviser had a meeting with Sadiq Ahmed, senior manager of the World Bank for South Asia region. bdnews24
