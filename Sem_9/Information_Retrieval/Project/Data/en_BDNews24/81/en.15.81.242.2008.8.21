 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) - Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club held Dhaka Abahani Limited to a goalless draw in Group B final match of the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. Both Dhaka Abahani and Ctg Mohammedan are level at seven points from three outings, but Abahani emerged Group B champions on goal difference having scored eight goals, three more than Ctg Mohammedan.

League champions Abahani will now face Group D runners-up in the quarterfinals as Dhaka Mohammedan and Arambagh KS, who have six points each from two matches, square off in the Group D decider Friday. The port city's black and white outfit will take on Group D champions. Having confirmed the quarterfinal berths winning two successive games, both Abahani and Chittagong Mohammedan took the field to a light mood, and it seemed B. League champions Abahani had no bite to win the match as there was no sign of fight in Abahani's performance compared with that in their previous two matches. The popular sky blue outfit put superb performance against Jatrabari KC and Ctg Abahani Limited in their first two matches to demolish them 4-0 and 4-1 respectively. Chittagong Mohammedan had the first chance at 20 minutes when Antoine lashed a powerful shot inside the box that went wide while four minutes later Abahani's Ujjal whipped in a cross for Pomeyie, who headed wide. After the breather, Abahani started to show better performance with taking control to the midfield, but their toothless attack hardly troubled the opponent defenders, who easily defied the moves Abahani produced in the second half. Abahani's striker Jahid Hasan Emily, who scored three goals in two matches, was totally anonymous throughout while his attacking partner Pomeyie was threatening at times with his quick movements, but it hardly affected Mohammedan. In the stoppage time, it was worse for Abahani when referee Tayeb Hassan gave defender Nazrul the marching orders. Away at Gazipur Stadium, 10-men Chittagong Abahani Limited and Jatrabari Krira Chakra played a 1-1 draw in the insignificant Group B match as both the sides already were out of the race after losing their first two matches against Dhaka Abahani and Chittagong Mohammedan. Ronny gave B. League side, Abahani, a lead in the 12th minute before Babu levelled the margin for the first division team, Jatrabari, in the 28th minute. Chittagong Abahani were reduced to 10 men when Othello Benny got the marching orders ten minutes from time.
