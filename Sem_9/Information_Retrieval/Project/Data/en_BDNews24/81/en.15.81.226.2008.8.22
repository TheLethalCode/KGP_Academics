<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Friday said the movie industry could contribute to Bangladesh's export growth and sought private sector's supports for cultural development. "Film can be one of the best ways by which Bangladesh can portray herself to the world as a culturally-creative nation," he said at an award distributing ceremony. "The film industry has the prospect to create positive trade links all over the world and even widen our export basket," Fakhruddin said at the Daily Star-Standard Chartered "Celebrating Life" prize-giving ceremony at the Bangladesh-China Conference Centre in the city. He said society required the patronage and support of the private sector for cultural advancement and that new faces should come to the cultural arena. "The film industry in Bangladesh is still tottering although our history of film making is quite old." "Except a few, most Bangladeshi film makers have very little international recognition", the interim government head said. He distributed prizes among winners in the photography, lyrics writing and film-making competition. The first prize in photography went to Selim Newaj Bhuiyan. Chandra Chowdhury won the best prize in Bangla lyrics category while Tanveer Ahmed Tomal won the best English lyrics prize. Adnan M S Fakir got the best debut documentary award and Abdullah Mohammad Saad won the prize for the best debut fiction. Lutfun Nahar Mousumi and Shibu Kumar Shil grabbed the prizes for best documentaries. The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam and Standard Chartered Bank's chief executive officer Osman Morad also spoke. Artists later rendered songs written by the contestants. bd
