 Washington, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has chosen Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden to be his vice presidential running mate, the campaign said on its Web site on Saturday. Biden, 65, is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a highly respected voice on international affairs. The announcement also was made in e-mails and mobile phone text messages to millions of supporters. Obama will face off in the November 4 presidential election against Republican John McCain, who has yet to announce his choice for the No. 2 spot. "Barack has chosen Joe Biden to be his running mate," the announcement said. "Joe Biden brings extensive foreign policy experience, an impressive record of collaborating across party lines, and a direct approach to getting the job done." Obama and Biden are scheduled to appear together later on Saturday at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The venue is where Obama launched his White House bid last year.
