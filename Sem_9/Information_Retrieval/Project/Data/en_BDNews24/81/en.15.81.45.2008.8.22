 DURBAN, South Africa, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa withdrew on Friday from the Champions Trophy in Pakistan next month because of safety and security concerns. A Cricket South Africa (CSA) statement said the decision followed a presentation from an International Cricket Council task force headed by the world governing body's chief executive Haroon Lorgat. "The decision was taken after assessment of the presentation as well as the information available from a number of other security reports, including one from the South African government," the statement said. South African Cricketers' Association chief executive officer Tony Irish said: "This was a difficult decision, but it was the right one. There is nothing more important than the safety of our national team. "We appreciate all the efforts of the ICC task team, the Pakistan Cricket Board, the Pakistan authorities and the security consultants. The players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of Pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in September." CSA president Norman Arendse added that he hoped the ICC would be able to reschedule the tournament. "After extensive discussions and frank exchange of views, the board resolved not to send our team at this time to Pakistan. We respect the right of the Pakistan Cricket Board to stage the tournament and we would urge the ICC to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible." The ICC executive will meet on Sunday to make a final decision on whether the tournament should go ahead as planned. England, Australia and New Zealand officials and players have also expressed concerns about security and safety after a series of suicide bombings in Pakistan
