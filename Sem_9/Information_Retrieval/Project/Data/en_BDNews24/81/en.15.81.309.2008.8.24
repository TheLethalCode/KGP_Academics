 Karolos Grohmann BEIJING, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee is devoted to sports and cannot force changes in a sovereign state, IOC president Jacques Rogge said hours before the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games on Sunday. Rogge told a news conference the IOC was "extremely pleased" with the organization of the August 8-24 Games and he praised the host country for putting athletes at their centre. Rogge has long defended the IOC's decision to host the Games in China after criticism from activist groups questioning Beijing's human rights track record. He says the IOC is not a political organization. "The IOC and the Olympic Games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world," Rogge told an IOC session in Beijing on the final day of the August 8-24 Games. "But we can -- and we do -- contribute to positive change through sport." The IOC was under constant attack in the months leading up to the Games, accused of doing nothing to pressure Beijing to improve human rights and change its policies towards Sudan's Darfur region and China's western region of Tibet. SEVERAL CHANGES Games organizers had promised several changes to existing policies including improvement of China's human rights and media freedom when they had won the Games, but not all were kept. Rogge said one of the most important intangible legacies of the Games was that the host country had been "scrutinized" by the world and had opened itself up to the world. "The world learned more about China, and China learned more about the rest of the world. And together, we shared the excitement and drama of the Games," Rogge said. "We are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport, but it is sport with a purpose. "Placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging Olympic values to promote better understanding between people, nations and religions stands at the core of our mission." Other intangible legacies of the Games included a heightened awareness of the environment in China and an intention by Chinese officials to invest heavily in mass sports to satisfy a huge enthusiasm for sport in China, Rogge said. China has topped the medals table at these Games for the first time, leaving the United States well in its wake. Rogge praised the "very intelligent" decision to put many of the venues built for the Games in universities so they would be used by students in the future. He said there would be "no white elephant" venues after the Games.
