 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  The teachers of Dhaka University were marking the anniversary of the August 23 incidents on campus last year, calling it a 'Black Day' and sporting black badges on Saturday. The Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) said Friday it was protesting the mass arrests of students and teachers of the premier university in the aftermath of campus unrest. "We are observing the day as a 'Black Day' as a mark of protest. This is our token protest," DUTA president and dean of the arts faculty Sadrul Amin told bdnews24.com Saturday. The DUTA will also hold a discussion at the Teacher-Student Centre at 4pm. DUTA general secretary professor Anwar Hossain said in line with a decision made in the last Senate meeting to observe the day as a 'Black Day', an emergency meeting convened on August 20 under professor Sadrul Amin's stewardship worked out the details of the programme. Social Science faculty dean Harun-urRashid told bdnews24.com: "I am still shaken by those incidents last year. The arrest of teachers and its aftermath were very unfortunate following a silent demonstration of teachers." "The government should have behaved in a more prudent way," he said. Rashid demanded a withdrawal of the all cases against the Aug 23 students. Seven of those students, now released from jail, are holding a solidarity rally at the foot of Aparajeyo Bangla in the midday. A case was filed against them with Shahbagh Police Station charging them with role in setting fire to a DGFI vehicle. Two senior DU professors Md Anwar Hossain and Harun-ur-Rashid were arrested on Aug 23, 2007 following violent clashes that erupted over the demand for withdrawal of the army camp from the campus. The DUTA president professor Sadrul Amin and professor Nimchandra Bhowmik and a number of students were arrested later. bd
