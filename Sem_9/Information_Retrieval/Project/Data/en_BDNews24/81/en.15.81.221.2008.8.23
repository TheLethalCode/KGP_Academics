<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China could host one of top annual international athletics meetings following the success of the Olympics, IAAF president Lamine Diack said on Saturday. "I think we have an opportunity to make the Golden League more universal," Diack told reporters. "By 2010 I want one in the United States and one in China." "They have built a fantastic stadium (in Beijing). It is not for Olympics only, we have to use it." Beijing or Shanghai would likely be the top Chinese candidate with Eugene, Oregon, site of the 2008 U.S. Olympic athletics trials, the favourite U.S. venue. The Golden League is currently limited to six European meetings offering a million-dollar jackpot to be shared by athletes who win their event at every one. The top one-day event in China is currently the Shanghai Golden Grand Pix. Grands prix meetings rank behind Golden League and Super Grand Prix events under the International Association of Athletics Federations' structure. Diack would like to revamp the Golden League format and expand the series to as many as 12 meetings by 2010
