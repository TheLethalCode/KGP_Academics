<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government has made significant advances in releasing Tarique Rahman to seek better medical treatment overseas, the home adviser said Wednesday. "We have made much progress, but it will take some more time," MA Matin told reporters after a meeting with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff at the home ministry. On whether the government had taken any further steps for Tarique's medical treatment in the country, Matin said: "He is being treated in line with the jail code." Asked if there was any legal predicament to releasing former prime minister Khaleda Zia and sending her son Tarique abroad, he replied in the negative. Earlier in the day, inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hasan after a meeting with the home adviser denied his reported comment of the previous day that Tarique was "not under prison authorities". "I did not make any such comment. I said that Tarique is under the supervision of doctors and under prison authorities. It is our responsibility to assure his every safety," he said. Asked whether there was any advancement on his treatment, the official said: "We did not discuss the matter." "We have not discussed Khaleda Zia either," he said. bdnew
