 Dhaka, August 26 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced the absconding former communications minister Anwar Hossain Manju to 13 years in jail, Tk 10 lakh in fines and another year in prison for non-payment. Judge AKM Arifur Rahman of the Special Judge's Court-10 handed down the verdict, which will be effective from the day the fugitive Jatiya Party chairman surrenders or gets arrested. Anticorruption Commission assistant director Sheikh Fayez Alam filed the case against Manju and his wife Tasmima Hossain on October 7, 2007 with Dhanmandi Police Station. The verdict said the accused had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for illegally acquiring wealth and another three years for concealing wealth-related information. The court ordered the government to confiscate Manju's illegal assets worth Tk 2.11 crore to be confiscated by the government. The two jail terms will be effective one after another, as they have been awarded for two separate offences. The case filed against Tasmima Hossain is on trial in the upper court. Earlier, the court sentenced Manju to two more jail terms of five and seven years for illegal possession of narcotics and accepting bribes. bdnew
