<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 24 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University syndicate has asked the caretaker government to scrap a case against seven of its students over campus unrest in August 2007. A DU statement issued Saturday said a syndicate meeting, chaired by DU vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz, urged the government to quash the case against the students. The syndicate members held that all quarters, including the teachers, the students and the government bear the responsibility of upholding a proper educational environment at the university. "Therefore the syndicate was requesting the government to consider quashing the case filed against the students with utmost sympathy and compassion." DU teachers and students, who observed Aug 23 as the anniversary of arrests and a campus crackdown after last year's unrest, pressed the same demand Saturday. In the face of protests staged after the arrests on campus last year, the government cancelled a number of cases against DU teachers and students, except one filed against seven students for allegedly torching an army vehicle in Shahbagh. The seven accused in the case have been released on bail. bdnews
