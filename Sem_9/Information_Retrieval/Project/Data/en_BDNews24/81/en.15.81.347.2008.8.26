 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) - Chairman of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission Dr Sa'dat Husain said Tuesday the results of the 27th BCS examinations could be published within the next 29 working days. He told bdnews24.com: "We are hoping the results will be out sometime in the next 29 days." Allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism have marred the transparency of the BCS exams. The PSC posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams, seeking applications for 1,776 vacant posts. As many as 1,36,105 people applide and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The authorities recalled 16,418 for vivas. The PSC declared 3,567 candidates successful after the oral tests, asking the authorities to appoint them. However, the interim cabinet cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams on May 30, 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports over irregularities. bdnews24
