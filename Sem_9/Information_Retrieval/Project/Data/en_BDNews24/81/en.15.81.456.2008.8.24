<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An emotional Zou Shiming thrilled China by winning their first Olympic boxing title in unexpectedly easy fashion on Sunday. World champion Zou was leading 1-0 on the scoreboard 19 seconds into the second round of the light-flyweight final when his Mongolian opponent Serdamba Purevdorj, suffering from a recurrent shoulder injury, returned to his corner. "During the second round we punched each and during that moment I could not raise my hand and I felt the pain," Purevdorj explained after the fight. His coach threw in the towel, meaning Zou, who had handed China their first boxing medal with bronze at the 2004 Athens Games, was awarded victory to deafening roars from a partisan crowd. Zou draped himself in the Chinese flag after winning the hosts' 50th gold medal of the Beijing Games and burst into tears during the medal ceremony. "I did not cry four years ago when I got the bronze but I told myself, when you get gold, you can cry," said the 27-year-old. "I originally wanted to go out there and put on a good show for everybody but the main thing is getting this gold," he added. A raucous Mongolian contingent then had a party at the Workers' Gymnasium with Badar-Uugan Enkhbat giving them their first Olympic boxing title by comfortably outpointing Cuba's Yankiel Leon. World championship silver medallist Enkhbat, 23, was on top throughout the bout and won a 16-5 victory points decision to leave Cuba facing the unusual prospect of having to leave the Games without a boxing title. The superpower of the sport, who came here with their least-experienced squad in years after being hit by a string of defections, were pinning their last hopes on Carlos Banteaux, scheduled to appear in the welterweight final later on Sunday
