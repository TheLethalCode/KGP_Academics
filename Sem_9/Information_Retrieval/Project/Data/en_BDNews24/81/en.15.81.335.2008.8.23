<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com) Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu on Saturday repeated his statement that the ninth Jatiya Sangsad election should be held in October, but added that an advance date could be given for upazila polls after the national polls. Amu made the demand while speaking Saturday noon at a meeting in memory of Awami League working committee member Mostaque Ahmed Sentu, who was killed in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an AL rally. Speaking the previous day, at a discussion organised by Mohila Awami League, in memory of those killed in the 2004 grenade attack, Amu demanded that Jatiya Sangsad elections be held before December, "in the second or third week of October". Speaking Saturday, Amu repeated: "We want Jatiya Sangsad elections first, before any other election. Not in December, but in October." "If necessary announce an advance date for holding upazila elections thereafter," he added. bdnews
