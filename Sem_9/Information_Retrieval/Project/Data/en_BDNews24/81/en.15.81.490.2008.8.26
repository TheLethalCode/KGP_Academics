<TITLE> India extends curfew to quell Kashmir protest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SRINAGAR, India, Tue Aug 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian police beat Kashmiri protesters who defied a curfew, police said on Tuesday, and troops searched for separatist leaders as the biggest anti-India protests in two decades showed no sign of abating. Authorities have detained three separatist leaders since Monday to defuse protests. They raided the homes of another dozen leaders as part of a manhunt that began on Monday night, but there have been few new arrests of senior separatists. Police on Monday killed five Muslim protesters who defied the curfew, bringing the death toll to at least 28 in the biggest demonstrations since a revolt against New Delhi's rule by the region's Muslim majority broke out in 1989. More than 600 have been injured in clashes over the two weeks of protests. The state, whose tourist brochures proclaim Kashmir valley as "paradise on earth", has suffered more than $1 billion in lost business. Police used tear gas and beat hundreds of protesters with batons for defying the curfew in the Achabal area, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer capital, police said. Residents in Kashmir stayed indoors as the military extended the curfew for a third straight day. Authorities blocked four local television channels from broadcasting on Sunday. The crisis has strained relations between India and Pakistan, which both claim the region in full but rule in parts, damaging a tentative peace process and raising fears Kashmir could again become a hotspot between the two nuclear rivals. It has also raised fears of communal tension in the state, which is split between the Hindu-majority region around Jammu city and the Muslim Kashmir Valley. Residents say the deaths have also fuelled more anger against India and further alienated Kashmiris from New Delhi. "TREATED LIKE SLAVES" "During three months of violent protests in Jammu police have killed three Hindus, just three Hindus," said 45-year-old Gausi Khan, a doctor. "And in just two weeks these people have killed more than 30 people (Muslims). This simple mathematics tells you India treats us like slaves." The crisis began after the state government promised to give forest land to a trust that runs Amarnath, a cave shrine visited by Hindu pilgrims. Many Muslims were enraged. The government then rescinded its decision, which in turn angered Hindus in Jammu, the winter capital of the region, who blocked a highway, the region's only road link, and attacked lorries carrying essential supplies to the Kashmir valley. To enforce the curfew in Srinagar, authorities deployed more Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) federal police. They have been criticized by Kashmiris for using excessive force, with reports that they have attacked journalists and ambulance drivers. The protests have tentatively united a disparate group of separatists like the All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, which condemns militant violence, and the breakaway group of hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, for years seen as marginalized. The government could be forced to suspend state elections due in Kashmir and Jammu this year, which would be a victory for separatists who have urged a boycott of any vote. In Kashmir, officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed in violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants since 1989. Human rights groups put the toll at about 60,000 dead or missing. Levels of violence in Kashmir had been falling in the past few years amid tighter Indian security and a tentative peace process between Pakistan and India
