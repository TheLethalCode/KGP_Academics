<TITLE> Zimbabwe's Mugabe appoints lawmakers, governors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Harare, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has appointed lawmakers and provincial governors despite deadlocked power-sharing talks, state media reported on Monday. He appointed three non-constituency members of parliament's upper house, the Senate, and eight provincial governors. Mugabe intends to officially open parliament on Tuesday despite protests by Morgan Tsvangirai's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) that this would scuttle negotiations on forming a unity government to end the current political impasse. In terms of the constitution, Mugabe can appoint five non-constituency members of the Senate. He has only filled three of those slots, presumably reserving the other two for the opposition. Tsvangirai maintains that a power-sharing agreement is being held up by Mugabe's refusal to give up executive powers. Mugabe says Tsvangirai wants to strip him of all authority. Under a power-sharing deal under negotiation, one of the two senate seats is likely to be filled by Tsvangirai, who has been earmarked to become prime minister.
