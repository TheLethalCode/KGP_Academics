 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Flood Forecast and Warning Centre reported Saturday that there was no fear of widespread flooding in the country at present, though a number of low lying areas have been inundated following last week's heavy rainfalls. "The situation will improve in a couple of days. There is no fear of further floods as rainfall has decreased," the Water Development Board's FFWC executive engineer Md Saiful Hossain told bdnews24.com. Thousands of people, however, have faced water logging in low lying areas of at least 10 districtsincluding Kurigram, Nilfamari and Cox's Bazarwhich were underwater after heavy monsoon rains. Seven rivers were flowing above the danger point, Saiful said. But, he added: "It is a natural scenario during the rainy season. Water is receding in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna basin, and in the Padma basin too." The Meteorological Department had earlier forecast that flooding was likely in the basins of the Ganges, Brahmaputa and Meghna toward the end of August. Heavy monsoon rains have already caused flooding in India's Assam and Nepal. Met official Farah Diba told bdnews24.com that rain was not likely during the coming week as the monsoon front was less active. The met office recorded 11 millimetres as the highest rainfall at Srimangal in the 24 hours up to Saturday midday. bdnews
