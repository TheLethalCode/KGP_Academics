<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Orthopeadic specialist Sirajuddin Ahmed pressed the government on Saturday to send Tarique Rahman abroad for medical treatment at the earliest possible date, calling his condition 'critical'. Professor Sirajuddin, chairman of the orthopeadic department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital and head of all four medical boards formed for Tarique, stressed the urgency for sending him abroad as he briefed reporters on the BNP leader's present medical condition. Tarique Rahman's condition is "very critical", the specialist said, adding: "We will not take any responsibility if any major incident occurs." The elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, Tarique who is detained on a number of graft charges has been undergoing treatment at BSMMU Hospital for the last eight months. Sirajuddin pointed out that he had strongly recommended Tarique be sent abroad for the sake of better treatment in his last report to the government. "I am making the same appeal still," the specialist said. "There is no better arrangement available in Bangladesh. He has been receiving treatment in BSMMU Hospital for the last eight months, but he is not showing any progress." Tarique is currently suffering from 11 separate complaints including neck and back ailments and kidney disease. The BNP senior joint secretary general was arrested on March 8 last year at his Dhaka Cantonment home. There are a number of corruption cases pending against him. bdnew
