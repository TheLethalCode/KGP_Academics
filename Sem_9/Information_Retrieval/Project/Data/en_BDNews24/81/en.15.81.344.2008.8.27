 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Six people were shot by gunmen in Gulshan Wednesday during an alleged attempt to extort 'illegal toll' money. One of the victims, and owner of a local rickshaw garage, Musharraf told bdnews24.com that he was sitting in front of his premises around 1pm, when two gunmen aimed several rounds of fire. Musharraf received a bullet wound to the side and jumped into a nearby ditch to survive. Five other victims were identified as rickshaw pullers Ali Akbar, 50, and Shaheen, 22, van driver Zahirul Islam, 20, and garment workers Abdul Jalil, 17, and Jainal, 28. They were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, while the gunmen fled the scene. Musharraf said that local criminals had been claiming 'illegal tolls' for years. "They might have carried out the attack as I refused to pay them," he said. bdnews24.c
