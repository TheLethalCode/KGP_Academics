<TITLE> Obama to announce running mate: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Caren Bohan CHICAGO, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama has chosen Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden as his vice presidential running mate, CNN said on Saturday, citing several unnamed sources in the Democratic Party. Biden, 65, is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a highly respected voice on international affairs. Obama was poised on Saturday to announce his vice presidential pick after days of suspense. There was no immediate confirmation that Obama had settled on Biden. The long-serving senator emerged as a strong possibility after three other contenders -- Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton -- reportedly were told they had not been picked. Biden, a Roman Catholic originally from the battleground state of Pennsylvania, would bring not only foreign policy expertise to the ticket but strong working-class roots that could help Obama connect with the blue-collar voters he has failed to attract in the run-up to the November 4 election against Republican John McCain. ABC News reported that the Secret Service, which protects candidates and sitting presidents and vice presidents, had sent a protective detail for Biden. ABC and other news media camped outside Biden's home said family members appeared to be gathering there. Stretching out the suspense for maximum political impact, Obama said on Thursday he had made a decision. He plans to give the first word about his choice to supporters via a mobile phone text message and e-mail, probably on Saturday morning. A big splash is planned a few hours later when Obama is set to appear at a campaign rally with his new running mate at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, where he launched his presidential bid last year. They will then make the run to the Democratic Party's convention, which opens on Monday in Denver. On Thursday, Obama will formally accept his party's nomination as its presidential candidate, making history as the first black American to do so.
