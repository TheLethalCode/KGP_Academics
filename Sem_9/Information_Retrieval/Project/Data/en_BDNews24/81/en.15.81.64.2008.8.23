 BEIJING, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Usain Bolt's Olympic performances have had more impact on a single athletics championships than those of any other athlete, IAAF president Lamine Diack said on Saturday.

Another world record fell to his long strides on Friday when Bolt, on the third leg, put Jamaica ahead in the 4x100 relay before Asafa Powell brought the baton home in 37.10 seconds. "I was a little bit prepared for something around 9.70 (in the 100), but this was not expected," Diack said of Bolt's 200. "I thought he would make the record but not this time.

But Diack said Bolt should be aware of beaten rivals who wanted to congratulate him and he should take time to recognise them. "I think it is normal," Diack said of Bolt's fun-filled moments. "I did not mind.
