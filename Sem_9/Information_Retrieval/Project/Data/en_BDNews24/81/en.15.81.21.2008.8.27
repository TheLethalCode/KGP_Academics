 Khulna, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  A bridge over the river Padma, a direct gas pipeline to Khulna and modernisation of Mongla port are part of major development plans for the southwest region of the country, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Tuesday. "The government is undertaking a 32-point programme for development of the southwest to be implemented in phases," the chief adviser said at a press briefing following a cabinet meeting at Khulna Circuit House. "It includes construction of the Padma Bridge at Mawa, supplying gas direct to Khulna by pipeline, opening of the 250-bed Sheikh Abu Naser Specialised Hospital and modernisation of Mongla port." The cabinet meeting began at 11am, after Fakhruddin and other members of the advisory council landed at the Khulna stadium, flown in by helicopter. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim were present alongside Fakhruddin at the press briefing Tuesday afternoon. Fakhruddin said among different decisions taken at the meeting the cabinet also approved in principle the Union Parishad Ordinance 2008. Replying to a question regarding the Jatiya Sangsad elections, the chief adviser reiterated that they would be held in December. "It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to announce schedule," he said. "But I have said earlier and now am saying again that the Jatiya Sangsad election will be held by December next." On the development plan, the CA said the draft design of the new Padma Bridge would be completed by 2009 and construction work would start by 2010. It would cost an estimated Tk 10,162 crore. Two separate projects, of Tk 628.70 crore and Tk 342.18 crore, are under implementation with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank for supplying gas to 21 districts of the country's southwest region including Khulna. He said Tk 17.52 crore has been allotted for improvement of education and infrastructure at Khulna University and Tk 22 crore for construction of a mosque and medical centre at Islami University. The 250 bed specialised hospital at Khulna Khalishpur and it would be opened soon, said the CA. Narail's 50-bed hospital would be upgraded to 100 beds and Magura 100-bed district hospital will gain another 50 beds.

A multi-pronged initiative has been taken for modernisation of Mongla port, including a Tk 548.43 crore project to maintain navigability of the port's Pashur river channel. A Tk 86 crore project to tackle water logging in Khulna city is now awaiting approval, the chief adviser said. A 40 megawatt rental power station has begun generating electricity for Khulna. If the 34.5 megawatt power station at Bhola goes into operation in October this year, the power situation in the region would significantly improve, the chief adviser told reporters.
