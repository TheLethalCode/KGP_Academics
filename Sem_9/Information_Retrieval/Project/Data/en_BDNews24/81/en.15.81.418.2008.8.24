 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University authorities have sent a psychology department teacher on a year's forced leave after charges were proved against him involving sexual harassment of a female student, a university official said Sunday. The DU syndicate, in a meeting on Saturday, formed a five-member committee with pro-vice chancellor AFM Yusuf Haider as its convener to suggest further possible action to be taken against him, DU treasurer Syed Abul Kalam Azad said. A student of psychology submitted the complaint of sexual harassment by Dr Md Kamal Uddin to vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz on April 23. The DU syndicate formed a committee on May 13, headed by the treasurer, to investigate the matter. bdnews24.com tried to contact Dr Kamal by phone for a comment but failed to reach him. bdnew
