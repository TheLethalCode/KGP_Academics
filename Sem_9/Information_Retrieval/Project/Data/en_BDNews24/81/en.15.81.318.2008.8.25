<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  A double from Anamul Haque took Farashganj Sporting Club to the semifinals of the Citycell Federation Cup with a convincing 2-0 win over Arambagh Krira Shanga in the first quarterfinal Monday at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Anamul gave Farashganj a lead in the 34th minute and sealed the match in the stoppage time. Both the teams put up signs of a fight from the beginning and Farashganj comparatively enjoyed superior ball possession as the match progressed. Arambagh launched the first attack in the match, but they were a bit unlucky for not having a goal in the eight minute as Syed Hossain Surat rattled the Farashganj crossbar and their foreign recruit Jerry Odesco Weah spoiled the follow-up despite getting into a better position. Two minutes later, Farashganj strike duo Khokon Das and Anamul scrambled in the box to squander a scoring chance as an Arambagh fellow defender cleared the ball with goalkeeper Piaruzzaman Piru lying on the ground. Captialising on a back pass from Yousuf, Khokon then drove the ball yards off the target before Amamul broke the off-side trap to tap a Yousuf lob home, giving Farashganj a deserved lead in the 34th minute. But, the Arambagh players rushed to the assistant referee demanding cancellation of the lead claiming an off-side and play resumed after five minutes. In the injury minute before the break, Weah chipped in a cross for Surat, whose header to the near post went wide. After the lemon break, Farashganj came close to widening their lead, but a Faisal header hit the crossbar to disappoint them. However, Anamul converted a corner with a well-judge header to see off Arambagh to the last four. Farashganj will face the winners in the match between Abahani Limited and Sheikh Russel KC. The dates of the semifinals are yet to be finalised.
