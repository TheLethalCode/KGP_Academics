<TITLE> Medvedev convenes security chiefs over Georgia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sochi, Russia, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev convened security chiefs on Tuesday to consider a plea from parliament to recognize two separatist regions of Georgia as independent, a move Washington says would be unacceptable. The Kremlin gave no details of the security council meeting but a government source said it would start at about 1 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT) in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where Medvedev has a summer residence. Russia's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will attend the discussion, which may also cover Moscow's future relations with the West, Russian media reported. Medvedev on Monday said Russia was ready for whatever action NATO might take, up to and including suspending all cooperation. "We want our relations to be fully fledged and those of partners, but we do not want an illusion of partnership," the president said. "Naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military bases, and being told: 'Do not worry, everything's fine'". In a further hint of trouble ahead, Putin told a cabinet meeting that Russia should reconsider some of the commitments it made during talks on entry to the World Trade Organization. "We do not see or feel any advantages from membership, if they exist at all," Putin said in comments posted on the government website. "But we are carrying the burden." Both houses of Russia's parliament unanimously adopted resolutions on Monday urging Medvedev to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and the second Georgian separatist region of Abkhazia. The Kremlin leader has yet to respond. Georgia and Russia fought a brief war over South Ossetia earlier this month after Tbilisi sent in troops to try to retake the province by force. Russia struck back with a massive Russian counter-attack by land, sea and air. U.S. President George W. Bush said he was deeply concerned by the parliamentary votes. He urged Russia not to recognize the regions, which rebelled against Tbilisi after the collapse of the Soviet Union and have since run their own affairs without international recognition. Senior officials of the world's seven leading industrial nations spoke on Monday by telephone and expressed alarm at reports Russia might recognize the rebel areas, the U.S. State Department said. Once again during the Georgia conflict, the G7 acted without Russia, which was admitted to the club as an eighth member in the late 1990s. Russia has pulled back the bulk of its forces from Georgia proper but has angered the West by keeping some troops in a large buffer zone around the two rebel regions, saying they are required as peacekeepers to guarantee security. The West says the size of the buffer zones violate the terms of a French-brokered ceasefire deal which stopped the fighting and has called on Russia to withdraw from them without delay. Georgia has complained that the Russian presence could give Moscow a stranglehold over key energy links. Georgia hosts a BP-operated oil pipeline which supplies around one million barrels a day of non-Arab crude from the Caspian to Europe, and a gas link from Azerbaijan to Turkey. BLACK SEA MANOEUVRES The United States is Tbilisi's closest big-power ally and on Tuesday U.S. navy vessels were bound for Georgia to show support and bring relief supplies -- a deployment that has irked Moscow. Russia media reported that the 'Moskva' guided missile cruiser, the flagship of the Black Sea fleet, put to sea again for what the navy described as a routine training exercise to test weapons and onboard communications systems. The White House announced that U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, a long-time critic of Russia, would visit Georgia early next month as part of a trip to show support for former Soviet states now seeking closer links with the West. Russian lawmakers said Medvedev should recognize the two regions because they had a stronger claim to independence than Kosovo from Serbia and could no longer live within a state that sent in soldiers to try to restore its control. Diplomats believe the Kremlin may stop short of granting recognition, in part because it fears encouraging separatist sentiment in its own restive regions. But they say Medvedev could instead use the threat of recognition as a bargaining chip in talks with the West.
