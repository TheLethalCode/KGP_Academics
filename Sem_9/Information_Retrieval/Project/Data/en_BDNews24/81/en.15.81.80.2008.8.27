 KIEV/TBILISI, Wed Aug 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine said on Wednesday it wanted to discuss charging Russia more for the lease of a Black Sea naval base, a move that could aggravate regional tensions already enflamed by Moscow's conflict with Georgia. As the US Navy shipped in humanitarian supplies to Georgia, Russia said its navy was watching "the build-up of NATO forces in the Black Sea area" and had started taking measures to monitor their activity. Georgia weighed its response to the Moscow-backed breakaway of two rebel Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and President Mikheil Saakashvili urged the West to stand firm in upholding international law. "Russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order. It's now up to all of us to roll Russian aggression back. If they get away with this, they will carry on ... they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood," he told Reuters in an interview. Russia quickly routed Georgian forces in a brief war over South Ossetia this month, the first time it has sent its forces into combat abroad since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The crisis has rattled the West and alarmed other former Soviet republics with sizeable Russian minorities, particularly Ukraine and the Baltic states. NAVAL LEASE Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko joined Western nations in condemning the Russian move on Tuesday to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states under Moscow's protection. "We are sorry about this decision, for Ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position," he said in an interview with Reuters. Yushchenko said Kiev wanted to raise the question of increasing Russia's rent on its Sevastopol base in Ukraine's Crimea region, the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet. Russia has said any renegotiation would break a 1997 agreement between the two countries, under which it currently leases the base for $98 million a year until 2017. "We will see how this will develop. We are sticking to the conditions on the timetable for the Russian fleet's presence there strictly," Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, told a news briefing. Nogovitsyn accused NATO nations of "ratcheting up tension" in the Black Sea, but said Russia was not planning to increase its own presence there. "Now we have people flexing their muscles, demonstrating force. We can only regret that," he said. A U.S. Coast Guard ship carrying post-war aid to Georgia arrived on the country's Black Sea coast on Wednesday, but backed down from docking in a Russian-patrolled port. The cutter Dallas had been due in Poti, where Russian troops are still manning checkpoints after pushing into Georgia during the war over South Ossetia. Instead it docked 80 km south in Batumi. The U.S. embassy in Tbilisi originally said the Dallas would be joined in Poti by a U.S. warship, the USS McFaul, which docked in Batumi on Sunday. But the embassy said late on Tuesday that the plan had changed. It did not say why. "This decision was taken at the highest level of the Pentagon," a U.S. embassy spokeswoman told Reuters. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the United States of shipping weapons into Georgia, a comment dismissed by the White House as "ridiculous". "EVIL EMPIRE" The crisis deepened with Russia's decision to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia and establish diplomatic ties with them. "Evil Empire 2" screamed a front-page headline in Georgian daily "Rezonansi", using a phrase once applied by US President Ronald Reagan to describe the Soviet Union. "Is Georgia torn up now?" asked another paper, Sakartvelos Respublica. Russia says it was obliged to intervene militarily to prevent Georgian "genocide" and defend the lives of South Ossetians, many of whom are Russian citizens, after Georgia attempted on Aug. 7 to retake the rebel region by force. While some Western governments have said Saakashvili bore at least partial responsibility for the outbreak of the conflict, there was strong and unanimous condemnation of the latest Russian move. "Russia's action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations," US President George W Bush said. Russia's Medvedev said Tbilisi's desire to seize back the regions by force had killed all hopes for their peaceful co-existence in one state with Georgia
