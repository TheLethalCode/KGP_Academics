 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Sunday spelled out a firm belief that party chief Sheikh Hasina would be freed from prison. After a presidium meeting at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's home, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that the AL would go to the polls under Hasina's leadership. Ashraful said the party leaders expected that the chief adviser in his address would announce specific dates for withdrawal of the state of emergency and elections. The AL expects a pledge from the CA on declaring war criminals unfit for contesting the polls, the AL leader said. "We will pull out all the stops to get our leader freed from detention," he said. "We strongly believe our leader will be freed and we will go to the polls under her leadership. Our leader will come out through a legal battle and constitutional process," Ashraful said. Asked how he could be so confident about the release of his leader, Ashraful said: "Those who understand politics will be able to understand how our leader will come out of jail." bdnews
