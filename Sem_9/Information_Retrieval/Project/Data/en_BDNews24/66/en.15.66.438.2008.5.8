 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Football Federation vice president Kazi Nabil Ahmed Thursday resigned from his post in the BFF emergency committee and as Bangladesh national football team leader for the SAFF Championship. Nabil cited that he would be busy with Abahani Limited, and sought the release, which came one day after the first meeting of the BFF executive committee held Wednesday. Newly elected BFF committee, lead by Kazi Salahuddin, took over charge on April 3 after being elected on April 28. President Salahuddin told reporters that he heard about Nabil's resignation from others, but was yet to get the copy. Nabil made no comment on his resignation saying "no comment" when bdnews24.com contacted him. It was, however, learnt that Nabil was hurt as he was left out of the emergency committee despite being considered from the beginning. A BFF member seeking anonymity said that Wednesday's meeting first formed a nine-member emergency committee keeping Nabil out though three other vice presidents were named in the committee. During the announcement of the emergency committee in the meeting, a member asked the meeting why vice president Nabil was not in the emergency committee though three other vice presidents were, but the meeting failed to give a satisfactory answer. President Salahuddin, later at a press briefing, told reporters that a 10-member emergency committee was formed that included himself, senior vice president Salam Murshidi, four vice presidents Manzoor Hossain Malu, Badal Roy, Shawkat Hossain Khan Jahangir and Nabil Ahmed and four other members.
