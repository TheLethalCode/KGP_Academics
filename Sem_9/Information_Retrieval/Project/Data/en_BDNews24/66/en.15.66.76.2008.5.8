The police raid killed Mullah Sarajuddin identified as Taliban's governor for Ghor and the police chief named only as Mawlavi, along with five other militants while planning to carry out a "sabotage" plan, the ministry said. There were no casualties among the police, it said in a statement, terming the reported Taliban deaths as a major achievement. The Taliban who lead an insurgency against the government and foreign troops, could not be contacted for comment immediately Separately on Thursday, a suicide car bomber targeted a convoy carrying foreign soldiers on the western outskirts of Kabul, but missed, and instead three civilians were wounded in the attack, a police official said.

The militants largely rely on roadside bombs and suicide attacks as part of their insurgency and are mostly active in the southern and eastern areas where they run a parallel administration.
