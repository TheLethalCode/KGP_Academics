 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League will stage hunger strikes in districts and upazilas, excluding Dhaka city, on May 20 demanding the release of its president Sheikh Hasina. The party has also demanded that Hasina be released to take part in dialogue with the government as a free person. The demand was made at Wednesday's meeting of the Awami League Central Working Committee at its Dhanmondi office, chaired by acting-president Zillur Rahman. Syed Ashraful Islam, the acting-general secretary of the Awami League, announced the programme after the meeting. The Awami League will also form human chains in Dhaka city to push the same demand, he said. The date for the Dhaka programme has not been fixed yet, he added. The meeting that started at 11am continued until 6:45pm. In a written statement, the Awami League said, "There can be no effective polls in the country sidelining the main and trusted political leaders. The Awami League categorically reiterates that the Awami League will take part in the upcoming polls under Sheikh Hasina's leadership". The statement also made some other demands: allowing Hasina to be treated abroad, complete withdrawal of the state of emergency and restoration of full political activities, withdrawal of cases against all politicians, release of all political prisoners, end to media interference, cancellation of the Election Commission's decision to redraw constituencies, arresting the price hike of essentials and others. Ashraful Islam did not take questions from reporters. He only announced the programmes. "We are yet to get invitation for the dialogue from the government," Islam said. On the Awami League's reaction to the speech of the chief adviser, the party in its written statement said: "Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed's speech has frustrated and angered people. The government has failed to create an environment conducive to a fruitful dialogue. The chief adviser's address is not acceptable to the people." "The political parties are not supposed to restrict their discussions to holding polls and organisational activities only sidelining national problems. The caretaker government has no right to play bluff with the political parties and politics." "The chief adviser has specifically hinted at including some constitutional issues like the system of governance and the duties of the Jatiya Sangsad; this is out of his authority. The chief adviser's speech is contradictory, unwanted and motivated," the statement said. bdnews2
