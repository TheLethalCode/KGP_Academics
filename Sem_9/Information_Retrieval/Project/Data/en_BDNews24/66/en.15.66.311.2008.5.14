 Yekaterinburg, Russia, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The six nations negotiating with Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program could guarantee Tehran's security, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Wednesday. "I think the 'Six' could make the following step: directly put concrete offers on the negotiating table, give Iran security guarantees and ensure a more distinguished place in negotiations on the situation in the Middle East," Lavrov said. Lavrov said the combination of negotiations and incentives could work to solve two issues simultaneously. "I am convinced that this is an effective way to relieving tensions in the region and regulating the situation surrounding Iran's nuclear problem," Lavrov said. The six nations negotiating with Iran to suspend its nuclear program are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- Russia, the United States, China, Britain, France -- and Germany. Lavrov met with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in this Urals city on Wednesday. Iran said on Tuesday it will soon offer new unspecified proposals in its dispute with the West over its nuclear program, but ruled out suspending uranium enrichment activity, which the Western powers suspect is aimed at producing bombs.
