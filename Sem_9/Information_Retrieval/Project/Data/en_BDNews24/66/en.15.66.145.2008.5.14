 LONDON, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will field the team who clinched the three-test series against New Zealand in Napier this year in the first match of the return series at Lord's on Thursday. "It will be the same attack, it will be the same team that played in Napier," England captain Michael Vaughan told a news conference on Wednesday. Vaughan's announcement means swing bowler Matthew Hoggard, who was dropped along with Steve Harmison after England lost the first test in Hamilton, will be 12th man at Lord's. James Anderson and Stuart Broad will form a three-man pace attack with Ryan Sidebottom. England - Alastair Cook, Andrew Strass, Michael Vaughan (capt), Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Monty Panesar, James Anderson
