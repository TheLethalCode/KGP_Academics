 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami said Wednesday that a move was underway to arrest him. "I know the move is on to arrest me. But I am not worried about it at all. I have faith in Allah. There are people to look into the matter," Nizami told reporters at the party headquarters in Moghbazar, a day after the Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against him and others in the GATCO scam case. "I was never involved in crime or corruption so that I should feel psychologically shaken." "I have been implicated in false cases before," he added. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against 25 people including former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her son Arafat Rahman Coco and Nizami. Investigation officer of the GATCO scam case, Zahirul Huda, told bdnews24.com that 12 accused in the case were shown fugitives. Nizami and former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar and Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury were among them. Nizami Wednesday demanded withdrawal of all false cases including the GATCO and Barapukuria ones immediately. Nizami demanded the release of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina in a rare gesture and said that there was no reason trial of the cases against them could be hampered if they were on bail." "There is no alternative to the release of the two leaders for an election acceptable to all," Nizami said. "An independent and sovereign Bangladesh is the result of democratic movement. People of this country were always respectful to democracy. They had never accepted any attack on democracy," he added. Nizami Wednesday alleged that the government had made a move to destroy "political leadership" in the country in the name of depoliticising. He demanded that the election be held by October and the electoral roll be finalised by June 30. The demands also include freedom of all arrested on political grounds. The Jamaat ameer faulted chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's speech to the nation. He alleged that Fakhruddin had stepped beyond his jurisdiction and pushed dialogue into uncertainty. "The Election Commission is tasked with preparing a flawless voter list and holding a free, fair and peaceful election. But the EC troubled its main task by intervening in some other tasks beyond its jurisdiction," Nizami said. The Jamaat leader said: "A move to turn the country into a 'vassal state' was on." Nizami said that Bangladesh had fallen victim to a deep-rooted conspiracy by the "imperialist and regional influential forces" that could not stand Bangladesh's successes in the past 15 years of democratic rule. According to the constitution, such a government could not take any decision on policy matters, but this government had been doing it, he added. bdnews24
