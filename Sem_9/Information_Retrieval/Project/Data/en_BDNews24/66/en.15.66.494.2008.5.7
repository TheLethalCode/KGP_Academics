 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The Duke of Gloucester arrived in Dhaka Wednesday on a four-day visit to Bangladesh. On the first day of the visit, Prince Richard, a first cousin of the British Queen, visited BRAC University's Architecture Department to have an idea about Bangladesh's architectural beauty. BRAC University vice-chancellor Jamilur Reza Choudhury briefed the Duke of Gloucester. Having trained as an architect, the duke has carried out full-time royal duties since the 1970s. He supports a large number of organisations, including many in the fields of architecture, healthcare and cultural relations. British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury accompanied the duke to BRAC University. "His personal visit demonstrates the importance the UK attaches to people-to-people links with Bangladesh; these links are the bedrock of the friendship between our countries," Choudhury said. The duke will visit Sidr-ravaged southern districts Thursday and is set to call on president Iajuddin Ahmed, the British High Commission said in a statement. The Duke of Gloucester is scheduled to leave Dhaka on May 10. bdn
