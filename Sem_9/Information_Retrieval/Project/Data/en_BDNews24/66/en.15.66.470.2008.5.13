 VINOVO, Italy, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus midfielder Mohamed Sissoko said on Monday he had no regrets about leaving Liverpool in January but did not expect Steven Gerrard to follow him to Italy. The tough-tackling Mali international has been a success in his first few months at Juve having left Anfield for 11 million euros ($17 million) after finding first-team chances limited. "I am very happy to be at one of the best clubs in the world  Juventus. All the time I enjoy Juventus games and this is more important for me," Sissoko told Reuters at Juve's plush training ground outside Turin. British and Italian media reports have said Serie A leaders Inter Milan are lining up a bid for Liverpool captain Gerrard but Sissoko doubts his former team mate would leave. "Steven Gerrard for me is one of the best midfielders in the world. If Inter Milan want him it will be difficult because he has been at Liverpool since he was young, he is one of the best players for Liverpool," he said. "We will see what happens in the next transfer window." English teams have dominated the Champions League this term with Manchester United meeting Chelsea in the final on May 21. Last season's winners AC Milan lost to Arsenal in the last 16 with Inter falling to Liverpool. Sissoko said Italian sides could fight back next season, especially with Juve in the Champions League qualifiers after two years out of Europe because of their match-fixing demotion. "I think when we see Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan, all these teams have very good players so I think next year the Champions League is going to be very hard," said the former Valencia midfielder, who has helped Juve to third in Serie A. "I think in England the game is a high tempo and since coming to Italy I think the intensity of the game is less but tactically I think it is very difficult to play in Italy. "I played in Spain, I play in Italy and I played in England. I can't say which one is the best, all three are very good championships.
