 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Thursday approved a chargesheet against 24 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia, in the GATCO corruption case, a senior official said. "The ACC approved the chargesheet against the 24 people as allegations against them were proved in a primary investigation," ACC director general (administration) Colonel Hanif Iqbal told reporters in his Segunbagicha office. The accused were responsible for costing the state coffers Tk 14.56 crore in losses, which was proved in the initial investigation, he said. Former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Motiur Rahman Nizami were also accused in the case. The ACC filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station alleging that GATCO's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco also stands accused of corruption in the case. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 in connection with the case. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Rail station. The accused awarded the tender to GATCO even though the company failed to meet all the conditions. It was alleged in the case that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the GATCO deal. bdnew
