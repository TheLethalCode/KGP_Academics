 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh military Thursday sent a second consignment of relief to Myanmar and promised to continue the nation's efforts to stand by the cyclone-battered people in the neighbouring country. A Bangladesh Air Force aircraft carried 10 tonnes of materials including medicines, dry food, tents and plastic sheets from Kurmitola Air Movement base. Brigadier General Anawarul Islam led a five-member team to Myanmar, as the hermit regime Thursday gave clearance to major international aid for millions of needy people hit hardest by tropical cyclone Nargis. Bangladesh Wednesday sent its first consignment of relief to Myanmar. A military spokesman said the 20-member team that went to Myanmar Wednesday returned to Dhaka later in the day. Anwarul said Thursday Bangladesh wants to continue its efforts to help the affected people, and if necessary, the military will take part in rescue operations. "If Myanmar government wants so we are ready to help the country with our expertise," he told reporters before leaving for Myanmar. If the relief help would continue, Brig Anwarul said: "So far as I know, yes." The team will return later Thursday from Myanmar, he said. Nargis hit Myanmar on May 3, bypassing Bangladesh. Initial response to the disaster was lukewarm while international aid agencies and donors are also struggling to send relief to the country because of restrictive policy by the Myanmar junta. Myanmar is still refusing to accept aid from the United States while Thailand Thursday offered to negotiate on Washington's behalf to persuade Myanmar government to accept US help. bd
