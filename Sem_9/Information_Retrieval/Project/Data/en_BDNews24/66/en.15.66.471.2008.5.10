 Dhaka, May 09 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Pakistan have identified lack of direct shipping links between Chittagong and Karachi as a setback to bilateral trade. Both countries have agreed that the Joint Business Council could examine the possibility of leasing vessels for Karachi-Chittagong route. Trade issues came up for discussion as foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury met with Pakistan commerce minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in Islamabad Thursday. "It was agreed (at the meeting) that lack of direct shipping links posed an impediment to trade," said a press statement received from Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad. "It was thought that the Joint Business Council could meet to brainstorm the issue and examine the possibilities of leasing vessels for dedicated Karachi-Chittagong routes and vice versa," the statement said about the outcome of the meeting between the two leaders. Iftekhar pointed to a huge trade imbalance against Bangladesh in talks with the Pakistan minister. "Dr Iftekhar Chowdhury proposed more imports from Bangladesh particularly of raw jute, jute goods, pharmaceuticals and ceramics for all of which there is potentially a large Pakistani market," the statement said. He also met with Pakistan information minister Sherry Rehman. bdn
