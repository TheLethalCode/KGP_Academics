 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Abahani Limited maintained their winning streak in the Premier Division Hockey League with an emphatic 4-0 win over Sonali Bank at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Wednesday. With the sixth straight triumph, the Dhanmondi-based outfit, Abahani, took sole lead in the 10-team point table with 18 points, three points ahead of Usha Krira Chakra, who, however, played a match less than the leaders. It was the second straight defeat for Sonali Bank, who remained on 10 points from six outings. Last year's joint-champions Abahani dominated over the giant killer throughout the 70-minute game and left the field with a deserved triumph. Sonali Bank, however, created some scoring chances, but their efforts went in vain due to failure of the forwards. Moududur Rahman Shuvo gave Abahani a lead in the 11th minute by a field goal and reached a milestone of scoring 100 goals in domestic meets, and the striker being set by Musa Mia doubled the margin in the 37th minute. Afterwards, Musa made it 3-0 converting a penalty corner in the 48th minute before Pakistani recruit Imran Khan ran down from the midfield to dodge past three opponent defenders to seal the victory for the sky-blues outfit in the 52nd minute.
