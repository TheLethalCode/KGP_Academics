<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Figueirense came back from three goals down to draw 5-5 at Portuguesa on Sunday, livening up an otherwise disappointing start to the Brazilian championship. The 10-goal thriller stood out on an opening weekend where several teams fielded reserve sides ahead of midweek matches in either the South American Libertadores Cup or the Copa Brasil. Promoted Portuguesa led 2-1 at halftime with goals from Marco Aurelio in the fourth minute and Patricio in the 44th, with Rodrigo Fabri replying in between. Cesar Prates equalised again for Figueirense with a free kick six minutes after the restart before Bruno Rodrigo, Diogo and Christian all scored in a four-minute spell for Portuguesa. Felipe Santana headed one back in the 70th minute and, after Portuguesa had Patrico sent off for a second bookable offence, Bruno Santos scored in the 89th and Felipe Santana stole the equaliser in injury-time. Vanderlei Luxemburgo's Palmeiras went down to a shock 2-0 defeat at Coritiba. Debutant striker Michael tapped in the first from a pass by Hugo in the 53rd minute and returned the complement for Hugo to score the second in the 83rd. Diego Souza of Palmeiras and Carlinhos Paraiba of Coritiba were sent off for fighting in the 74th minute. Flamengo, knocked out of the Libertadores Cup in stunning style by Mexico's America on Wednesday, recovered to beat Santos 3-1 on coach Caio Junior's debut. Caio Junior has replaced Joel Santana, who has left to take over the South African national side. Flamengo lost 3-0 at home to America on Wednesday, having won the previous leg 4-2. Botafogo's 2-0 win over Sport Recife was interrupted by a floodlight failure at the Joao Havelange stadium for 20 minutes in the second half
