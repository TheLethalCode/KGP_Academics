 JAMMU, India, May 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bus veered off a mountain road in Indian Kashmir on Thursday and fell into a river, killing at least 28 people, police said. The bus skidded off the road while negotiating a sharp bend and rolled down 300 feet into the Chenab River, police and witnesses said. "We have recovered 28 bodies floating in the river and looking for more people now," Syed Innayatullah, a senior government official told Reuters. Rescuers were facing difficulty due to the rocky terrain. "Only wheels of the bus are visible and rest is all submerged in the river," said a witness, who added he had seen at least 40 people in the bus. Last month, a bus veered off a bridge and plunged into a canal in western India, killing at least 44 school children and three adults.
