 HONG KONG, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices retreated on Tuesday as some investors saw a recent rally to record highs as excessive, while Asian shares gained as banks were bolstered by further signals the worst of the credit crisis may now be over. Trading was subdued for the most part, with the dollar steadying against the yen ahead of April US retail sales data due out later in the day, as well as a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The earthquake on Monday that killed nearly 10,000 people in southwest China hit shares in Shanghai .SSEC, though trading was suspended in companies directly affected. Still, it failed to have an impact elsewhere in the region amid expectations the economic fallout will be limited. Inflationary pressures from rising food and energy costs, and further fallout from the global credit crisis, have been among the most pressing concerns to investors in Asia this year, and despite a more positive tone, little appeared to change on Tuesday. Analysts attributed the fall in crude futures mainly to booking profits after prices set a string of records last week, hitting an all-time peak of $126.40 on Monday, and bringing its gains so far this month to around 15 percent. The surge has been led by concerns over supply disruptions in the North Sea and Nigeria. "The pitch of the rise (of oil prices) has been very rapid since the start of the month so it's about time that we saw some profit-taking," said Tatsuo Kageyama, an analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo. Crude was down 75 cents at $123.48 a barrel at 3:49 a.m. BST. The tone in stock markets was more positive, with the MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS up 0.2 percent, taking its gains since hitting a mid-March low to 17 percent. The index is still down more than 8 percent this year. Banking shares such as Japan's Mizuho Financial Group were among the day's gainers after MBIA Inc, the world's largest bond insurer, said its new business volumes appear to be rising in the current quarter in a sector that has been a key source of concern during the global credit crisis. The outlook took the sting off MBIA's quarterly loss of $2.4 billion on Monday as it took charges on billions of dollars of exposure to bonds linked to subprime mortgages. Meanwhile, Europe's biggest bank, HSBC Holdings said its profit in the first quarter beat a year ago as growth in Asia helped counter some $5 billion in hits from bad debts on US home loans and asset writedowns. Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 rose 0.6 percent, with exporters also gaining on a softening Japanese yen that could make their products more competitive in key overseas markets and boost returns from abroad. Taiwan's shares rose 1.2 percent while Singapore gained 0.4. Indexes in South Korea and Australia were flat. Shares in Hong Kong .HSI gained 0.3 percent led by a 1.5 percent gain in HSBC following the update about its quarter. Other gainers included Aluminum Corp of China Ltd and online services provider Tencent surged after the bourse operator said on Friday they will be added to the Hong Kong's blue-chip index. Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea were closed on Monday for a public holiday. CHINA HIT But China's benchmark stock index .SSEC fell 1.3 percent, after earlier being down more than 3 percent, on uncertainty following the deadly earthquake. Shares were also dented after the central bank announced on Monday the fourth bank reserve ratio hike this year. Insurance shares were particularly hit, with China Life Insurance down 3.6 percent. Elsewhere markets were subdued, with the dollar trading at 103.91 yen, little changed from Monday's levels. "Players are unsure whether credit-related woes have really bottomed out or whether troubles will keep surfacing," said a dealer at a European bank in Tokyo. Gold fell to $879.50/880.50 an ounce from $884.60/884.20 late on Monday, as the halt in crude oil's climb dented the appeal of the metal as a hedge against inflation. Bullion prices have fallen more than 14 percent since reaching a record high at $1,030.80 an ounce on March 17. It tumbled to a four-month low of $845 in early May
