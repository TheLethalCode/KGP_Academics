 LISBON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sporting secured the second automatic Champions League spot when they beat Boavista 2-1 on the last day of Portuguese Premier League season on Sunday. Porto, who clinched the championship more than a month ago, finished with 69 points from 30 matches after they were stripped of six points for alleged bribery of referees in the 2003-04 season. Sporting finished second on 55 points and Vitoria Guimaraes third on 53. Vitoria Guimaraes, who crushed Estrela Amadora 4-0 on Sunday, booked a place in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time. Veteran Benfica playmaker Rui Costa did a lap of honour after his side's 3-0 victory over Vitoria Setubal on Sunday, his last match before retiring. "Retired with my fans, retired with pride, I feel happy now," the 36-year-old told 50,000 supporters at the Luz stadium in Lisbon. "There was a lot of emotion and sadness in my retirement but I feel proud of my career," he said. Champions Porto, without nine first-team regulars, celebrated their third successive title with a 2-0 win at Naval on Saturday. Benfica, Maritimo and Vitoria Setubal will play in the UEFA Cup. FIRST GOAL Brazilian midfielder Rodrigo Tiui gave Sporting a 2-1 home win over Boavista with his first goal for the club. Boavista had gone ahead after five minutes when striker Ivan tapped in a cross the left by Mateus. Argentine midfielder Romagnoli equalised from a penalty six minutes later and Tiui grabbed the winner with a close-range shot after being set up by Izmailov on 23 minutes. Vitoria Guimaraes opened the scoring against Estrela Amadora after 37 minutes through a header by captain Flavio Meireles. Winger Alan, Brazilian defender Andrezinho and the French midfielder Desmarets completed the rout in front of 28,000 delirious fans. Benfica failed to clinch a Champions League spot despite a 3-0 home victory over Vitoria Setubal. Rui Costa set up Benfica's first goal with a cross for Greek Konstantinos Katsouranis to head home after 25 minutes. Paraguayan striker Oscar Cardozo and Nuno Gomes completed the scoring
