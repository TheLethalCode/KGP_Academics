 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) and Citibank NA Bangladesh signed an agreement Wednesday on online bill collection facilities. Customers of DESA will be able to receive their bills at CitiConnect, Citibank's payment gateway and make online payments as well, according to the MoU. Md Rafiqul Alam, DESA secretary, and Khondoker Rashed Mahmud, head of Citi's Global Transaction Services, signed the agreement on the DESA premises on behalf of their organisations. Brigadier general Nazrul Ahasan, chairman of DESA, and Ivo Distelbrink, managing director and regional sales head of cash management of Citi, as well as other senior officials of both organisations attended the ceremony. The DESA chairman said the government entity had run into profits over fiscal 2006-07. "Our purpose is to bring back discipline and accountability in DESA," he added. Ahasan also said that they had already made arrangements with various banks in a bid to automate the government electricity supply company. "DESA has bill collections booths in more than 200 bank branches in Dhaka to facilitate automated bill collection," he said. Ahasan said that some approvals from related authorities like the central bank were still to be received to introduce the arrangement with Citibank. "Introduction of such a faster and more convenient collection system through CitiConnect will not only allow customers to better manage their time and efficiency, it will also enable them to streamline their bill collection, reporting and accounting process," he said. Speaking at the event Ivo Distelbrink said CitiConnect is widely used by their clients in Asia especially government institutions in collecting taxes, customs duties as well as utility payments from customers. "I am happy to see the launch of CitiConnect in Bangladesh which will help the country move forward in e-governance," he added. bdn
