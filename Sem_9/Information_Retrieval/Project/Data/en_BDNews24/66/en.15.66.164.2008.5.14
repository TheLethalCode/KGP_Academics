 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced "The Daily Janakantha" editor Atiqullah Khan Masud to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for his involvement in another fraud case. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-2 set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises handed down the verdict. The court also sentenced the other accused Rajuk authorised officer ATM Qamruzzaman to seven years' RI. The court slapped a combined fine of Tk 1.22 crore on the two. They have to serve another year in jail in case of failure to pay the fine, the verdict said. Atiqullah Khan is in jail, but Qamruzzaman is on the run. The joint forces arrested Atiqullah on March 7 last year. The Anticorruption Commission on Sept 30 last year filed the case with Motijheel Police Station against the accused for having roles in approving the design of a building illegally. According to case details, Atiqullah submitted plan of a 15-storey building to be constructed on Malibagh DIT Road to Rajuk on April 19, 1999. On May 23, Rajuk authorised officer ATM Qamruzzaman himself developed a fake design of the building, sealed it with Rajuk approval and signed the same. Showing the fake design, Atiqullah took Tk 1.22 crore from 17 buyers of flats in that building. The court on March 6, 9 and 20 and April 27 sentenced Atiqullah Khan Masud to a total 28 years rigorous imprisonment (seven years' RI in each case) in jail in four other fraud cases. bdnew
