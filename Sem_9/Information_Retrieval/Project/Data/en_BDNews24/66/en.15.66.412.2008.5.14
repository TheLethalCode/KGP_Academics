The chief adviser will be accompanied by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's country representative Adrianus Spijkers and Asian Development Bank resident representative Hua Du. Agriculture adviser CS Karim, agriculture secretary M Abdul Aziz and other ministry officials Wednesday inspected the compound of Cheradangi High School in Sadar upazila, the site earmarked for the farmers' rally. They expressed satisfaction over the preparation and management of the rally site and instructed district officials to fine-tune the arrangements. The CA will inaugurate local paddy harvesting by scything paddies ripened in the crop field of Yaar Mohammad, a farmer. Nabiul Haque Molla, DC for Dinajpur, told reporters that the CA's helicopter would touch down at Dinajpur helipad at 9:40am Thursday and he would travel to Cheradangi School grounds by road. The DC said, after attending the rally, the CA will go to the government food depot at Poolhat in Dinajpur town to inaugurate the government's paddy and rice procurement programme. About the CA's visit, CS Karim, now in Dinajpur, told reporters: "The CA is coming to Dinajpur to join the farmers here, to share their joy of harvesting the bumper boro yield and to congratulate the farmers on their grand success." The agriculture adviser said the credit of putting up the "grand show of productivity" goes to farmers. "This massive success has been possible this season because our farmers toiled hard, staying ever vigilant through the season," he said. "We only tried to facilitate their efforts. The government will always be with the farmers so that jointly we may achieve food autarchy by boosting own production and cutting down on imports," Karim said. The district administration informed reporters of the arrival of 126 farmers from other districts and 100 from Dinajpur to participate in Thursday's rally.
