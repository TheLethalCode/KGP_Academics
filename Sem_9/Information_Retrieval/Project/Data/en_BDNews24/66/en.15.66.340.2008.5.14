 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com) - Midfielder Arif Khan Joy coming out of retirement Wednesday joined the national football camp for next month's SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Defender Nazrul Islam, who also retired from the national team, is also all set to return to the national fold and is expected to join the camp Thursday. Of 28 players, 18 footballers joined the camp on the first day and the rest are expected to join in a couple of days at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "I feel happy to return to the national team again," said Joy. "I will try to give my best for the nation as the coach and the national team management committee have pinned their hopes on me," said the former national skipper. Coach Abu Yousuf said that the inclusion of Joy and Nazrul would certainly strengthen his side, but he would emphasise the need of fitness of both players, who were out of action for a long. Hasan Al Mamun, who led the side in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan, also felt that the inclusion of experienced Joy and Nazrul will help the side. The NTMC, led by former booter and BFF vice president Badal Roy, felt the inclusion some senior players to the side after the national team played a goalless draw against Afghanistan and going 2-1 down to Kyrgyzstan in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. The committee discussed the matter with Yousuf, who was apparently against the new inclusion over the fitness worried, but later agreed considering his venerable midfield. Badal Roy, Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, Hasanuzzaman Bablu were present on the first day's training. Roy said that they were considering arranging two practice matches for the national team against the foreign footballers in the country now. The BFF vice president said that they were also considering arranging at least two matches in Thailand before going to Sri Lanka to play the SAFF Championship, scheduled for June 3 to 15.
