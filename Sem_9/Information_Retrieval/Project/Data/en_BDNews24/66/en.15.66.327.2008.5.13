The strike was announced because of the Valencia-based club's failure to pay the players money owed from as far back as last season. Team spokesman Luis Manuel Rubiales said they had contacted players from Real Madrid to explain their decision and that they had received a sympathetic response. It is the second time the players have threatened strike action over outstanding payments. Last month they said they would go on strike if the club did not meet a deadline to resolve the debts, but called off the action after receiving guarantees the payments would be made. Players have said they never received the money and the team has staged protests before their last two league matches. They stood still after kickoff against Deportivo Coruna on Wednesday and wore t-shirts calling for action from the board before Sunday's 5-1 home defeat to Valencia.
