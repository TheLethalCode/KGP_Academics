<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The acting secretary general of a BNP faction, Hafizuddin Ahmed, said Sunday he would relinquish his position once the ongoing efforts for unification of the BNP factions succeeded. "Issues related to unifying the party are being discussed with the pro-Delwar faction of the BNP. We hope the party will be consolidated through discussions by May 30," said Hafiz. Expressing hope on the party attaining solidarity, Hafiz said: "I have no special interest in sticking to the party secretary general's office. I'd like to see the party united at any cost." Saying that discussion with the Khandaker Delwar Hossain group was on, Hafiz said: "I was also present at more than one meeting. From what I perceived from those meetings, I can assure you that BNP will soon be united and Khaleda Zia will lead it to forthcoming dialogue and elections." On the GATCO graft case filed against Khaleda, he said it had not been right to sue Khaleda and other leaders in this manner. The accused will be acquitted in the process, Hafiz said. He urged the government not to "harass the accused in the case politically". Demanding Khaleda's freedom, he said it would be possible to finalise the reform proposals through convening a national council, as Khaleda had notified that she would consider the reforms. Earlier, on May 7, the party's acting chairman M Saifur Rahman said before leaving for Singapore: "This acting chairperson's office is an ineffective one." Referring to a comment made by Saifur, Hafiz said he did not know anything about Saifur's chair being or made 'ineffective' and that it was just his personal opinion. The BNP chairperson's adviser ZA Khan, former lawmaker Masud Arun and others were present during the briefing. bdnews24
