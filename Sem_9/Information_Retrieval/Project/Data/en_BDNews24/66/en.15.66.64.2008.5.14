<TITLE> Iraq PM in Mosul to direct al Qaeda offensive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, May 14 (bdnewsw24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki flew to the northern city of Mosul on Wednesday to take charge of a big offensive against al Qaeda in what the U.S. military says is the group's last major urban stronghold in Iraq. The operation -- which Iraqi military officials hope will deliver a knockout blow to al Qaeda militants in northern Iraq -- commenced on Saturday. Officials said Maliki went straight into meetings with top generals after arriving in the city, Iraq's third largest. "The prime minister has arrived in Mosul to supervise the military operation," Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Mohammed al-Askari told reporters in the city. Sunni Islamist al Qaeda gunmen have regrouped in Mosul and the surrounding province of Nineveh after being pushed out of Baghdad and western Anbar province by U.S. and Iraqi forces. It was unclear how long Maliki would stay, but his visit is similar to when he flew to the southern city of Basra in late March to oversee a crackdown on Shi'ite militias there. That offensive got off to rocky start when the Mehdi Army militia of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr put up fierce resistance in Basra. Fighting also spread to Baghdad. Sadr's opposition movement in parliament and the ruling Shi'ite alliance brokered a deal on the weekend to end the Baghdad fighting, although sporadic clashes keep breaking out. Iraqi military officials have said the goal of the operation in Nineveh is to "clean the province of al Qaeda remnants". Vehicle curfews have been imposed throughout the province, whose capital is Mosul. The U.S. military is providing support, but the operation is Iraqi-led. U.S. officials blame al Qaeda in Iraq for most big bombings, including an attack on a Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that set off a wave of sectarian killings that nearly tipped Iraq into all-out civil war. A build-up of U.S. troops last year and support from Sunni Arab tribes that turned against al Qaeda allowed the military to conduct a series of offensives that largely pushed the militants into northern areas, including Nineveh. However, U.S. commanders say al Qaeda in Iraq, although weakened, can still carry out large-scale attacks. PEACE URGED IN BAGHDAD In Baghdad, Iraq's security forces urged Sadr's movement to do more to ensure the weekend truce took hold and offered cash rewards for militiamen who gave up their weapons. Major-General Qassim Moussawi, spokesman for Iraqi security forces in the city, said gunmen were still attacking troops in the capital despite the agreement to end nearly two months of fighting that has killed hundreds of people. Clashes broke out in Baghdad overnight and on Wednesday, police said, killing seven people and wounding 28. The goal was to disarm the militias, Moussawi said. Many of the Shi'ite gunmen claim loyalty to the anti-American Sadr, but his control over them is unclear. "So far we are still at the zero stage. Nothing has been done to implement the agreement on the ground," Moussawi told a news conference. "We expect our brothers in the Sadr bloc to help our forces implement the agreement .. Some centres will be opened to offer money to those who hand over guns willingly." Despite the fresh violence, residents in Sadr's eastern Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City and the U.S. military said it was calmer there on Tuesday night compared to recent weeks. A senior political aide to Sadr has urged patience with the truce and said it might take time to take effect.
