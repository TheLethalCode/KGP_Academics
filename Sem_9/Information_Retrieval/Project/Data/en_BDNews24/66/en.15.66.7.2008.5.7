<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Wednesday submitted a chargesheet against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and eight others in a Niko scam case. Updated The ACC handed the chargesheet to Tejgaon Police Station, which was turned in to the additional metropolitan magistrate court No. 3. Magistrate Golam Rabbani received the chargesheet. The graft watchdog had earlier approved the chargesheet against Hasina and another former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 others in separate Niko graft cases on April 30. ACC deputy director AMM Sabbir Hassan who filed the cases against the accused on Dec 9 last year submitted the chargesheet against the Awami League president. Hasina, during her term as a prime minister allegedly approved a Niko deal in 2001, which cost the government Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses, according to case details. The case alleged that Niko Resources was "very inefficient" in different aspects, including technical know-how for oil explorations, but the deal was approved in violations of a proper procedure. The BNP-led government also connived with Niko in implementing an "illegal" joint venture agreement soon after the alliance assumed power in October 2001, according to the case filed against Khaleda. Khaleda, the then prime minister, allegedly ignored opinions of the gas experts and took sides with Niko on the deal, costing the state Tk 10,000 crore in losses. bdnew
