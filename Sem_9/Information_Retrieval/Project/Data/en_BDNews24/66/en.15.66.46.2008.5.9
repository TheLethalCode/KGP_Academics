 WELLINGTON, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - National cricket coach John Bracewell will not seek reappointment when his contract expires next April, New Zealand Cricket said on Friday. "John has informed me that he will not be looking to extend his contract for another term and will instead pursue other coaching opportunities in cricket," New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said in a statement. The search for a replacement will start soon. "We will now begin a process to recruit a new Black Caps coach and will soon begin a search for suitable coaches throughout the game internationally." Bracewell, 50, currently in England where the team has just started a tour, has been national coach since 2003. He was coach of English county side Gloucestershire for five years before his current job. "I have enjoyed my time with the Black Caps and am now looking forward to future challenges at the conclusion of my contract next year," Bracewell said. Bracewell was a right arm spinner in the 1980s, playing 41 tests and 53 one day internationals. Former test opener, India coach and current NZ Cricket's high performance manager, John Wright, has been mentioned in media reports as a favourite to replace Bracewel
