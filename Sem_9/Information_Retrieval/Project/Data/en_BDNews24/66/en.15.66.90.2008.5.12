 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alex Ferguson said Manchester United will "bounce" into the Champions League final against Chelsea after pipping the Londoners to the Premier League title on Sunday. United won 2-0 at Wigan Athletic with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and 34-year-old Ryan Giggs while Chelsea could only draw 1-1 at home with Bolton Wanderers. It was Ferguson's 10th title in charge of United and a 17th for the club overall. "It was a tough one alright," Ferguson told Sky Sports. "We had some nervous moments and when it started to rain anything can happen on the greasy surface. "Then our oldest player, Ryan Giggs, 10 medals, comes on and scores, fantastic." Ferguson said he thought his side could pass Liverpool's record of 18 titles and that the current crop of players is probably the best he has ever had at the club. He also said he had no thoughts of retirement. "If we win the Champions League I can say this is the best team I've ever had," Ferguson said. "I'm at a great club, it's much easier for me than everybody else. "This is fantastic, how could I do without this, tell me? This side is young and developing all the time. "The good thing is we'll be bouncing into the Champions League final." Giggs came off the bench to seal victory, making it a memorable day for the Welsh winger who claimed a 10th title winners' medal and matched Bobby Charlton's United appearance record of 758. "It was an important goal because it gave us a two-goal margin," Giggs said. "But I'm not bothered about records, it's about championships. I've got 10 now and just hope I can win another win." Ronaldo put United ahead from the penalty spot in the first half after a nervy start from the champions. "The pressure was high but we believed in ourselves and we deserved to win the Premier League," said the Portuguese who has bagged 41 goals in all competitions this season. "I knew if I scored the penalty we would win the match, I'm very happy to help my team again." United play Chelsea in the Champions League final in Moscow on May 21
