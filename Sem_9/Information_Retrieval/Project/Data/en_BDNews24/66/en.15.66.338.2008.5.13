<TITLE> No mockery of polls: Ghulam Quader </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)Adviser Ghulam Quader Tuesday shrugged off the danger of the government making a travesty of the year-end election, as many political leaders fear. Addressing doubt expressed by political parties after the chief adviser's speech Monday over the possibilities of holding the polls without lifting emergency rule completely, Quader emphasised that the "election would be held properly, leaving no space for any question to arise". "We want to hold the 2008 polls most freely and fairly, where everyone will participate and no-one will be able to raise a question. The political parties also want the same," the communications adviser told reporters after a meeting in his office. "We would like to get rid of the disrepute earned as the world's most corrupt nation. We want to see thoroughly honest people running the elections next. The honest among the old, however, will be most welcome to join hands with the young and fresh leaders." On formulating a national charter as mentioned by the CA in his address, Quader said: "The issue of the national charter will be clarified by the CA's office. In case the government fails to reach a consensus with political parties over the national charter issue, no decision will be thrust upon people to accept." On the possibility of holding elections under the emergency, the adviser said: "The emergency may be relaxed or lifted. The government will take measures as the situation warrants." Asked if the CA's silence over demand for the release of Khaleda or Hasina in his address might hurt dialogue, he said, "It will not affect dialogue in any way. We're optimistic, as the political parties too would like to see all the problems resolved through dialogue." On why the CA did not mention the price hike in his speech, Quader said: "There's nothing special to say about the prices of essentials. The reality here is, prices cannot be lowered anymore. But I think the CA's speech upheld the hopes and aspirations of grassroots people." On the reactions of the political parties, he said: "Political leaders are wiser and more experienced than all of us." bdnews24
