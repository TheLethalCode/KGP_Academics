 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League wants reflection of its demands, including freedom for the party chief, in the expected speech to the nation by the chief adviser, the party's presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Saturday. The party must be focused on the elections and should not stray away from the stand on the polls, Amu urged leaders and workers. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to make an address to the nation soon on the government's position on issues the nation is going through. Amu Saturday talked to reporters in front of the party's headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue as he was on his way to attend a memorial meeting for Rashida Mohiuddin who died recently. In a recent dialogue with the advisers, the party put a five-point demand, which includes release of Sheikh Hasina and allowing her to travel abroad for better treatment, lifting of emergency rule, trial of war criminals and curbs on the prices of essentials. Amu said that he expects the issue of re-demarcating the parliamentary constituencies will also come in the chief adviser's speech. "A big complication has been created about the matter. It will create more complexities. The decision should be suspended now," he said. Amu said the date for sharing views with party activists and leaders scattered across the country would be decided at the central working committee meeting, slated for May 13. bdnews24.
