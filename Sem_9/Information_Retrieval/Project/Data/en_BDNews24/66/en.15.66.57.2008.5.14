 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com) - Former table tennis star Jobera Raham Linu has been elected member of the executive committee of the Bangladesh Olympic Association Wednesday. Linu, also a joint secretary of the Bangladesh Table Tennis Federation, put two other contenders-- Jobayedur Rahman Rana and Ahmedur Rahman-- to bag the highest votes of 29. Rana got 23 while Ahmedur secured 11 votes out of 61 cast in the by-election held at the National Sports Council. "I will try to take the women's sports forward," a tearing Linu told reporters after being elected. The election commission on May 1 announced the by-election for three member posts -- one from national federation, one from women's sports council and one from Olympiad. The commission, having scrutinized the papers, cancelled two nominations submitted by Rafia Akhter Dolly and Kazi Shahana as both candidates failed to meet the criteria. Dolly submitted her nomination for the post of the women's sports council from Chittagong while Shahana placed her nomination as a former Olympiad. Of the 37- member executive committee, two posts of members -- one from International Olympic Committee and one from the Women's Sports Association -- will remain vacant for the four-year stint.
