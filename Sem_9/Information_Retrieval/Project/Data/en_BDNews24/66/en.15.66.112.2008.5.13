 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) - Prime Bank chairman Azam J Chowdhury Tuesday said they would extend their hands in future if the Football Federation showed something better in the days to come. His commitment came during a courtesy meeting with the newly elected BFF committee at the Prime Bank office in Gulshan. The BFF high-ups led by former football star Kazi Salahuddin met the officials of the Premier Bank, who promised to sponsor the upcoming B. League and the National Football League for Tk 1.25 crore. Chowdhuy welcomed the newly elected committee and felt proud to be sponsoring the two upcoming events. "We will not be confined to our promised money for two sponsorships, and we will extend our assistance in future, but it will depend on how the federation performs this time," Chowdhury told reporters after the meeting. He also said that the bank would broaden the area of sponsorship in future if it saw football go forward. The chairman of the Bank hoped that the federation would look at the grassroots level in a bid to promote football across the country and try to restore the past glory of the game. Chowdhury said that they would sit among themselves and find out ways to increase the amount of sponsorship money and that they would focus more on football if the money was spent in the proper way this time. The director also said that he would set a standard so that the bank could continue to sponsor football in future. BFF president Kazi Salahudddin, expressing satisfaction over the discussion, said that they wanted to take the relationship between the federation and the bank to a higher level and that time would prove it. Salahuddin said that the football would not go back for lack of efforts as they had come to power with a heavy responsibility and hoped that football would reach a certain level in three to four years. BFF senor vice president Salam Murshidi, also chairman of the B. League committee, said that they would win the heart of the sponsors through performances and take any amount of money, given by the sponsors, gratefully. BFF vice presidents Manzoor Hossain Malu, Kazi Nabil Ahmed and member Anwarul Haq Helal were also present on the occasion.
