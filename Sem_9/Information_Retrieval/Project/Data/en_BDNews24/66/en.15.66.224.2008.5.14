 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka sent the chargesheet in the GATCO scam case to a senior special judge's court Wednesday. But the court did not issue any order. Mohammad Zahirul Huda, deputy director of ACC and investigating officer of the case, submitted the chargesheet against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 24 others to the CMM's Court for Dhaka Tuesday. Court assistant Kazi Nur Alam told bdnews24.com: "The judge went home. He did not make any order regarding the chargesheet in the GATCO case." Huda told bdnews24.com that 12 accused in the case were shown fugitives. Former ministers Motiur Rahman Nizami, M Saifur Rahman, Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar and Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury were among them. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman Coco with ties to the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people alleging that GATCO's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Rail station. The accused awarded the tender to GATCO although the company failed to meet all the conditions. It is also alleged that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the GATCO deal. bdnew
