 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)A Tk 25,500 crore annual development programme for the next fiscal year will be approved at a meeting of the National Economic Council by the end of May, a top official said Saturday. Against the current backdrop, employment generating projects will be given emphasis in the 2008-09 ADP, planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will chair the NEC meeting. In the present budget, the size of the original ADP was Tk 26,500 crore. As implementation was not satisfactory, a NEC meeting on March 24, chaired by Fakhrudddin, cut it down to Tk 22,500 crore. Although the ADP was revised down, the number of projects increased. The number of projects was 931 in the original ADP, which increased to 1,058 in the revised one. The new ADP will undertake more projects on agriculture, power, rural development and poverty alleviation. Asked how the local and foreign assistance ratio in the new ADP and what the total number of projects would be, the secretary said: "No final decision has yet been taken on these issues." An analysis of 36 ADPs since independence reveals that every year the size of the ADP has increased. For the first time, the ADP has been slimmed down. In 1972-73, the size of the country's first ADP was Tk 501 crore. In fiscal 2006-07, the ADP size was Tk 26,000 crore. After slashing this year's ADP, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam had told reporters: "ADP revision is a continuous process. This year also, the original ADP has been slashed down to Tk 22,500 crore." In the first nine months (July-March) of this fiscal year, 36 percent of ADP has been implemented, and the rate was 39 percent in the same period of the last fiscal year. bdnews
