 LONDON, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori confirmed on Wednesday he would play in the first test against England at Lord's on Thursday after having two stitches removed from a split on his spinning finger. Vettori injured the index finger of his left hand in a warmup match against Essex and did not play in the four-day match against the English Lions. "I have gone through the last two trainings," Vettori told a news conference on Wednesday. "It's not perfect but it should be fine for the game. "Batting won't be an issue at all. It's just in the worst possible place for a left-arm finger spinner but it's healed really well." New Zealand named a 12-man squad on Wednesday with the final place to be decided between middle-order batsman Daniel Flynn and pace bowler Iain O'Brien.
