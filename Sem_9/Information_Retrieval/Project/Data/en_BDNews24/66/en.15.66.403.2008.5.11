<TITLE> Millions to tune in for Premier League decider </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan may have had a point when he described the Premier League as predictable but that will not reduce the excitement of Sunday's last-day deciders at Stamford Bridge and the JJB Stadium. There is indeed not much new in Manchester United seeking their 10th Premier League title in 15 years nor Chelsea their third in the last four, yet all over the world millions will tune in to see which of English football's cash-rich superpowers prevails this time. Both have 84 points but United's superior goal difference means they will secure the title if they get as least as good a result at Wigan Athletic as Chelsea manage at home to Bolton Wanderers. Seeing as Chelsea are on the verge of completing a fourth successive unbeaten home season and that Bolton are just about safe from relegation, the chances are that United are going to have to beat their Lancashire neighbours to retain the title. Having done just that, usually handsomely, on each of the six times they have played them the odds remain very much in United's favour. However, they have stumbled on the last day before and as Chelsea coach Avram Grant said this week of his 30 years of watching English football: "You never know what is going to happen." Lower down the table either Everton or Aston Villa will finish fifth to secure a UEFA Cup place while it is highly likely that two from Birmingham City, Reading and Fulham will join already-relegated Derby County
