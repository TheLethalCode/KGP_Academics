 LONDON, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Premier League should be decided in a playoff in future if teams finish level on points at the top, Chelsea manager Avram Grant said on Friday. Chelsea go into the final weekend of the season level on 84 points with leaders Manchester United but they will lose the title race on goal difference if both clubs record a similar result on Sunday. United's tally is 17 goals better. Grant, whose team face Bolton Wanderers while United visit Wigan Athletic, said: "I prefer the system in Italy. If you have the same points you play a playoff and it is decided on that. "Of course, I have interest now to say that, but I like it anyway. Sometimes, you score more goals against the weakest teams. If you have the same points, you are at the same level so you need to play to see who is the better," he told reporters. However, Grant, who has promised to share a bottle of Israeli wine with United manager Alex Ferguson before the two title contenders meet in the Champions League final in Moscow on May 21, is refusing to look back on missed opportunities. "Of course, after any game you look back and say 'I could have done this better'. But I think in the season not everything can be perfect, not for us and not for United. We came to the same points and now we wait for Sunday.
