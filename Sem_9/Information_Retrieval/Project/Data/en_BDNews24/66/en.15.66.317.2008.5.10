 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Centre for Policy Dialogue Saturday recommended an aggressive marketing strategy to be taken for public-sector jute mills to revive the industry. The nongovernmental think-tank also made a number of suggestions about the jute industry in a research titled "In Search of a Future for the Jute Sector: Constraints, Opportunities and Policy Options". CPD senior research fellow Dr Uttam Kumar Deb and research fellow Khondaker Golam Moazzem presented the study at a roundtable at BRAC Centre. Jute mills labour leaders and government officials who were present at the roundtable however did not agree with parts of the study. They said the study was fraught with errors and some said it was incomplete. The CPD recommended a slow, steady and guided growth mechanism and a change in the marketing strategy for BJMC jute mills to revive the jute sector. It stressed reviewing the jute policy. "Draft policy will need to be substantively improved to provide strategic direction to the jute sector and to come up with an effective and realistic plan of action for short, medium and long terms," CPD said. "The idea of an independent jute board may be considered. The jute board is also expected to take measures to ensure high value addition of jute fibre in the country." "The huge debt burden on both public and private jute mills will weigh on their operations and viability," it said. The CPD stressed actions against the allegations of corruption in government-owned jute mills and underlined the need to restructure and write off the debt burden. It also suggested rationalisation of the workforce in BJMC mills. The CPD study said the wage structure in the BJMC mills is "very high" -- from a minimum of Tk 4,400 to a maximum of more than Tk 10,000, an observation that drew flak from labour leaders. "BJMC workers received high wage compared to their productivity level," the research said. Labour leader Shahidullah Chowdhury criticised the observation and said wages for workers in India are double the amount Bangladeshi workers receive. "I am disappointed by this research," he said. Textile and jute secretary Abdur Rashid Sarker said there were mistakes in the study. The study gave wrong information about the number of jute mills in the country, he specified. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation chairman Ataharul Islam pointed out that the study said the BJMC had been paid Tk 200 crore to buy raw jute in 2007, but the exact amount was Tk 150 crore. Terming the study incomplete, Islam said the jute mills under the BJMC counted Tk 5 crore in losses in April 2008 alone due to the power crisis. In the last 10 years, BJMC had counted Tk 600 crore in losses, but the study skipped the point, Islam said. Chartered accountant Humayun Kabir said: "Market is an important place in an age of globalisation. There are no guidelines in the study on how to survive competition." bdnew
