<TITLE> Wind, rain next week may compound Myanmar crisis: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Geneva, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's recovery from a deadly cyclone could be hindered by strong winds and rain over the coming week, the UN weather agency said on Friday. "Occasional tropical rain showers" are expected through next Wednesday May 14, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said, further forecasting "a period of heavy rainfall settling in around Thursday or Friday next week". It said southwesterly winds may then hit the low-lying areas devastated by Cyclone Nargis, which killed nearly 23,000 people and has left as many as 1.5 million in need of housing, food and clean water. The WMO said the weather front could "compound the situation in the coastal region by enhancing precipitation and possibly affecting run-off or surge". "While the uncertainty of the exact timing of more significant rainfall is high, ensemble prediction systems also support the threat of a stronger rainfall episode during next week," it added.
