 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) - Last season's joint-champions Abahani Limited and Usha Krira Chakra recorded their fourth successive win in the Premier Division Hockey League at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Thursday. Defender Chayan converted four penalty corners as Abahani came from behind to beat Azad Sporting Club 6-3 in the first match while a super hat-trick from Rahul Kanti Roy powered Usha to a massive 7-1 win over Shadharan Bima in the second encounter. Azad stunned Abahani in the very third minute as Jamil Bin Talib put Azad ahead converting a penalty corner, but the minnows failed to keep the momentum against the giants, who ended the first half with a comfortable 4-1 lead. Chayan converted penalty corners in the 10th and 13th minutes before Jimmy gave Abahani a 3-1 lead in the 15th minute. Chayan scored his third in the 21st minute while Udit Kumar reduced the Azad margin in the 42nd minute. Abahani took a 5-2 lead with Musa scoring the fifth goal. Belal Hossain pulled off another goal for Azad in the 61st minute before Chayan scored his fourth goal and sealed the match in the 63rd minute. In the second match, Usha took a 3-0 lead in the 18th minute with Dinar, Habul and Muktar netting one goal each before Rahul Kanti Roy struck three goals in a row in the 22nd, 36th and 46th minutes to complete the hat-trick. However, Afsaruddin reimbursed one goal for Bima in the 43rd minute. Pakistani recruit Tareq Aziz scored in the 51st minute to ensure Usha's fourth win in as many matches.
