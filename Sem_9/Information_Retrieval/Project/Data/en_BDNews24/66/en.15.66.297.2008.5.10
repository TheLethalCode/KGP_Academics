 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  More than 50 people were injured in hours of clashes between students and security officials in the city's Tejgaon area Saturday, a day after a student died in a road accident in front of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. Saturday's violence forced the authorities to vacate the student dormitories as they did not want to take any further risk of chaos. The recurrence of violence hugely disrupted traffic on the main thoroughfare in Tejgaon industrial area for three hours Saturday. The angry protesters, who demanded better road safety in front of the institute, took to the streets Saturday morning and smashed several vehicles. Among the injured were some pedestrians while most of them were students, witnesses told bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider at the scene. Some policemen were also injured. The students' violent action prompted police action while the institute authorities failed to take the morning to tame the situation after the student's death Friday night. Late Friday, the students blocked the road through Tejgaon for one and a half hours after a bus ran over a student, Ashiqur Rahman. Police had to interfere with rubber bullets late Friday to negotiate with the protesting students, who vowed to resume the protests Saturday morning. Police fired teargas Saturday morning to disperse the students after they refused to leave the streets. The protesters attacked the security personnel with pieces of bricks and stones. Tejgaon Industrial Zone police chief Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com: "The police had to go for action since the situation was beyond control." After two spells of meeting with the protesting students, the institute authorities asked the residents to vacate the dormitories to establish peace. Rezanur Rahman, the institute's instructor, told reporters: "The students began to leave the dormitories from 3:00pm as per the decision of the authorities." He expected that the dormitories would be vacated completely by the evening. Shamsul Alam, principal of the institute, said it was difficult for them to control the situation, as the students continued violent protests Saturday even after their promise of fulfilling their demands. The students set a 10-point charter of demands to be fulfilled. The demands include compensation to the family of the dead student, construction of speed breakers in front of the institute. bdnews24.co
