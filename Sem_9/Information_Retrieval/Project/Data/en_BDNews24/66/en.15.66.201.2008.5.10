<TITLE> Zimbabwe's MDC to contest run-off against Mugabe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Zimbabwe's main opposition group said on Saturday he would contest a run-off against Robert Mugabe after disputed elections on March 29 in hopes of unseating the veteran president. But Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he would only participate in the run-off if international observers and media had full access to ensure the poll is free and fair. The opposition has accused Mugabe and his ruling ZANU-PF party of trying to intimidate voters and rig the ballot. Official results show Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the presidential poll -- but not by enough votes to secure an absolute majority and avoid a run-off. In a parallel parliamentary vote, the ruling ZANU-PF lost its majority to the opposition for the first time since independence in 1980. "The MDC ... will contest the run-off. I am ready, and the people are ready for the final round," Tsvangirai told a news conference in South Africa. It was the first time the opposition leader committed to participating in the run-off, which he says is not necessary because he believes he won the election outright. "We want unfettered access of all international observers," he said, listing the conditions for his participation in the run-off. "Media access should be unfettered, both print and international media." Mugabe's government has barred most international observers from past polls, saying they are biased, support the opposition, and undermine the electoral process by interfering. It has allowed some regional states to monitor past elections and has also invited observers from Russia. PEACEKEEPERS Tsvangirai said he was also asking the regional SADC grouping to send peacekeepers to Zimbabwe to instill public confidence in the vote. He said post-election turmoil and weeks of delays in confirming the winners of the March vote had discredited the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, and he called for the body to be reconstituted. Tsvangirai, who left Zimbabwe shortly after the elections and has been engaging in regional shuttle diplomacy to garner support, said he would return to Zimbabwe within two days. "The election should take place no later than May 24," he said. The MDC, rights groups and Western nations have accused ZANU-PF of launching a campaign of violence to ensure Mugabe wins a run-off. ZANU-PF denies the charge and accuses the MDC of carrying out political attacks. Zimbabwe's government last month accused Tsvangirai of treason and of working with former colonial power Britain to topple Mugabe in the elections. Zimbabweans had hoped the election would usher in a period of prosperity and greater freedoms. Instead, they have fallen victim to a struggle between their president and Tsvangirai, who has raised questions about his leadership by touring African states seeking support from leaders instead of taking on Mugabe at home. Critics blame an economic collapse in Zimbabwe on Mugabe's policies, including the seizure of white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. Mugabe, 84, says sanctions imposed by his Western critics have ruined the country.
