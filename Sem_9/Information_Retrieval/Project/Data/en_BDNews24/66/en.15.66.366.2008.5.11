 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Sunday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant case against her as the trial was not completed in time. Advocate Monjila Faruq submitted the appeal on behalf of the former prime minister at the HC bench of justice Md Iman Ali and justice Md Emdadul Haque. The hearing on the writ petition is likely to take place on Monday. Hasina, in the writ petition, sought an order declaring the case proceedings illegal as the trial had not been completed in 60 days as prescribed by law. The AL chief appealed to the court to stay proceedings of the case until a verdict on the writ petition. Hasina's counsel barrister Shafiq Ahmed said the ACC law stipulates that a person arrested by the joint forces be sent to the Anticorruption Commission in 48 hours from the time of arrest. "Investigation has to be done within 60 days of the filing of a case. The trial process has to be completed in 60 days after the judge takes the case into cognisance," Shafiq explained. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking bribe in return for allowing three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna and using the money for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. The court received the chargesheet on Jan 10, but the case is still dragging on. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 20 last year. The case is now on trial at Dhaka No. 1 Special Judge's Court. The court fixed Monday for framing charges in the court. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 last year. bdnews2
