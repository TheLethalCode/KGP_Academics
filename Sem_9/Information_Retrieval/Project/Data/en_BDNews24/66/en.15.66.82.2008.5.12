<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - River Plate, knocked out of the Libertadores Cup in astonishing style by nine-man San Lorenzo, bounced back to beat Gimnasia-La Plata 4-2 in the Argentine championship on Sunday. The win took Diego Simeone's team top of the Clausura championship on goal difference from Estudiantes, who beat Boca Juniors 1-0. River badly needed a good result after a week in which they lost 1-0 to arch-rivals Boca Juniors and went out of the Libertadores Cup after squandering a 2-0 lead and drawing 2-2 with opponents who had two players sent off. "Those who wanted us to see us dead and buried will have to wait a little longer," said former Argentina captain Simeone. River had to work hard for their win, going off at halftime to a chorus of jeers as they trailed 2-1. Ignacio Piatti put the visitors ahead in the 26th minute with a stylish goal and, although Matias Abelairas equalised from 25 metres 10 minutes later, a Juan Neira goal put Gimnasia back in front four minutes before the break. River levelled again four minutes after the restart when Abeilaras crossed for Diego Buonanotte to score before Abelairas volleyed River ahead with his second goal four minutes later. Gimnasia had defender Alvaro Ormeno sent off for a second bookable offence in the 58th minute and former Argentina forward Ariel Ortega, making a rare first-team appearance, completed the scoring. FREE KICK Estudiantes, coached by Simeone's former Argentina team mate Roberto Sensini, beat Boca with a 75th-minute header from Ezequiel Maggiolo following a free kick by Juan Sebastian Veron. Boca were missing injured playmaker Juan Riquelme as they lost for the second time in the championship. River and Estudiantes have 30 points from 14 games. Only four points separate them and sixth-placed Boca. Independiente moved fifth, ahead of Boca on goal difference, by beating San Lorenzo 1-0 away to give new coach Claudio Borghi a winning start. Uruguayan Guillermo Rodriguez scored the winner from a corner in the 46th minute. Velez Sarsfield are third with 27 points after beating Rosario Central 2-1 on Saturday, ahead of San Lorenzo on goal difference
