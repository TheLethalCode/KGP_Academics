 Brahmanbaria, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  Rail links between Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet remained suspended for 11 hours from early Wednesday after a train accident at Ashuganj station killed eight people and injured 30 others. Authorities suspended the Ashuganj rail stationmaster, a train driver and some other employees, and formed a committee to investigate the incident. Upaban Express bound for Sylhet from Dhaka hit the waiting Noakhali Express from behind at Ashuganj railway station in Brahmanbaria early Wednesday. The accident snapped rail links and stranded Turna Nishitha Express at Ashuganj station. The train from Chittagong started out for Dhaka around 11:30am, shortly after the rescue operation was completed. Communications secretary Md Mahbubur Rahman visited the scene Wednesday. "The accident occurred due to the negligence of the driver of Upaban Express and the station master," he said. The secretary said a four-member committee headed by Bangladesh Railway chief engineer Nur Mohammad has been formed to probe the matter. "The committee will submit a report soon," he said. The stationmaster for Ashuganj, Upaban train driver, assistant train driver and Upaban security guard have been suspended, Rahman said. Brahmanbaria superintendent of police Ataul Kibria told reporters that the station master, assistant station master and all staffers of Ashuganj railway station fled the scene immediately after the accident. "Three compartments of Noakhali Express derailed. The engine and some compartments of Upaban Express also were damaged," Ashuganj police sub-inspector Md Kamruzzaman told bdnews24.com. About 30 injured passengers were rescued by the local police and fire service personnel and admitted to different hospitals of Bhairab, Brahmanbaria and Ashuganj, he said. Brahmanbaria deputy commissioner Md Abdul Hye rushed to the scene after the incident and oversaw the rescue operation. Two relief trains arrived from Dhaka and Akhaura around 2:15am and started the rescue work. bdnews24.com/
