 Dhaka, May 08 (bdnews24.com)A European team will arrive in Dhaka in June to recommend whether the EU should send observers to Bangladesh for the upcoming ninth parliamentary elections. "The exploratory mission is likely to arrive in Bangladesh in June," Dr Stefan Frowein, head of the delegation of the European Commission in Dhaka, told reporters at a press conference at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, which was organised to mark European Day. "The mission will talk to political parties, the Election Commission and others. It will assess the political situation in Bangladesh necessary for holding a free, fair election," he said. The European Union withdrew its 10-member polls watch team as the caretaker government of President Iajuddin Ahmed was preparing to hold the ninth parliamentary polls without the main political parties on Jan 22, 2006. Frowein said the team would recommend to the EU Headquarters whether the union should send its polls observation mission. There are two types of polls observers. Members of a long-term observation mission will stay in Bangladesh for six weeks while short-term mission members will stay a maximum of 10 days, including the voting day. bdn
