 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)In a crucial address to the nation, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Monday that the election to the ninth parliament would be held in the third week of December. "I hope all voters will exercise their constitutional right properly on the day of voting. The next election will bring a golden opportunity to the politicians eager to open a door to the golden future for the nation," he said in his televised speech. The chief adviser said the government would start formal dialogue with political parties on May 22. "It is the responsibility of all of you to make the dialogue a success. In a word there is no scope for failure. The nation is now united in its aspirations. The journey that we started on Jan 11, 2007 is near its end." "We will definitely reach our desired goal with our united effort," Fakhruddin said. The ban on indoor politics all across the country will be lifted, effective from Tuesday, he said. Meanwhile, the home ministry issued a circular lifting the ban on indoor politics all across the country with a series of conditions attached. In his speech that made five major points, Fakhruddin told the nation: "To create a congenial atmosphere for elections and to make electoral publicity easier, the government would withdraw or relax the related sections of the emergency laws and rules as and when necessary." The government will make steps to prepare a "national charter" on all issues on the basis of a consensus before the elections so that a "qualitative improvement comes in government and the political system". After taking office, the caretaker government's main aim, according to the chief adviser, was to hold a "free, fair, neutral and acceptable election and start a post-election healthy democratic system". "To achieve the aim a flawless voter list was necessary," he said. "A correct voter list was the demand of all political parties. With that aim we quickly restructured the Election Commission. About 6.5 crore voters have so far been registered" Fakhruddin thanked the Election Commission, armed forces, field level administration and development partners for this. Fakhruddin said, "The precondition of a meaningful, free, fair and acceptable election was checking black money and muscle power, establishing the rule of law, conducting an anti-corruption drive, improving law and order and, above all, making state institutions effective and dynamic." "The government has been working with that goal in mind and has achieved substantial success in creating an environment congenial to elections." The national election would be held any day in the third week of December. The Election Commission would announce the specific date of election as per the election schedule. Fakhruddin said: "We are in the final stages of the election process. Our aim is to establish a sustainable democratic process by holding a free, fair and acceptable election following the earlier announced roadmap." "Before the main dialogue we have completed 22 rounds of informal talks. Five advisers of the government have worked relentlessly for the purpose. We will sit in formal dialogue with the political parties from May 22," he said. The Chief Adviser's Office will send out letters to political parties starting Tuesday, inviting them to the dialogue. "I firmly believe national unity will be reached on every important issue in the historic dialogue." "Preparation of a national charter based on the consensus reached with the participation of the government, political parties, representatives of all classes and professions was urgently required," he said. The "national charter" will carve out a "proper electoral structure and a healthy and stable democratic system". Fakhruddin described different steps taken by the government for holding a free, fair and meaningful election, including an amendment to election laws, steps to hold municipal and city corporation elections before the national elections. He said the local government would be helpful in creating a congenial atmosphere for holding national election. The chief adviser said. "Without establishing a proper and stable democratic system, all our efforts will go in vain." "We hope the implementation of an internal reform of the political parties voluntarily. The nation expects successful implementation of the expected reform for providing the nation with democratic behaviour, honest, efficient and dynamic leadership." Fakhruddin said a consensus to make the post-election parliament effective must be established before the election. "Several proposals in this regard have already been discussed. It has to be ensured that nobody would reject election results or boycott parliament." "I hope this will be given emphasis in the dialogue. The importance of the steps taken by the caretaker government such as separation of the judiciary, reforms to the Election Commission, Anticorruption Commission and other commissions done in public interest has to be realised and carried forward, if necessary." The chief adviser said: "The present world is very competitive and fast. To keep pace with it all political and administrative activities would have to be complementary to the economy." Fakhruddin said: "The main cause of the anarchic situation before January 11, 2007 was the serious erosion of the rule of law." "Our government played an uncompromising role in establishing the rule of law." "The improvement of the overall law and order has been possible because of your respect to the rule of law and cooperation. I thank all political parties, professional organisations, civil society and common people for this." The chief adviser said: "If our government did not conduct an anti-corruption drive the people would not have got idea about the depth of corruption in society." "Corruption is the main enemy of national progress and democracy. We must be united to build a corruption-free society." "From a political viewpoint, the main weakness is the lack of balance of power. Over-centralised power is never helpful to stability and responsible governance," he said. Fakhruddin said balance of power, rule of law, healthy politics, an effective parliament, responsible administration are essential for a stable system. "There has to be infrastructure to uphold this. Such an infrastructure would always keep the nation united in national interest. I urge all political parties, professional organisations and people from all walks of life to prepare and infrastructure which would keep political, economic and administrative stability," he said. bdnews
