 MOSCOW, May 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Dmitry Medvedev warned on Friday against "irresponsible ambitions" that lead to war as tanks and missile launchers rumbled over Red Square in a show of Russian fire-power not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union. Medvedev, in his first major public event since being sworn into office, told 8,000 parade troops and guests at a ceremony to mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany that Russia would not tolerate "disrespect for international law". "We must treat very seriously any attempt to sow racial or religious enmity, foment the ideology of terror and extremism or meddle in other states' affairs, especially by redrawing borders," Medvedev said. War veterans boasting chestfuls of medals applauded, some with tears in their eyes, as supersonic fighter jets and bombers screamed overhead in formation and impeccably uniformed, goose-stepping honor guards saluted the Russian flag. Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov rode past the massed ranks of troops in a silver open-top Soviet Zil limousine to take their salute, barking congratulations to each group in turn on the 63rd anniversary of Russia's World War Two victory, which cost more than 20 million lives. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, at times looking emotional, sat next to Medvedev on a viewing platform listening to martial music from a brass band and watching the parading troops, but did not speak. It was Putin who as president ordered the revival of the Soviet tradition of parading military hardware through Red Square on Victory Day for the first time since 1990. Medvedev succeeded Putin as president on Wednesday. Opinion polls showed the decision was popular with most Russians, who hail Putin for restoring some of Russia's greatness and power after the chaos which followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. PROUD VETERANS Despite the cost and worries about damage to historical monuments such as St Basil's Cathedral, the veterans were particularly proud to see tanks, anti-aircraft missiles and nuclear missile launchers back in Red Square. "We can sleep easily at night with an army like this," said Yakob Vasilyevich, a former World War Two fighter pilot watching the parade. "Europe has always coveted our territory -- just look at Hitler and Napoleon." Gesturing to the Tu-160 supersonic bomber whistling overhead, he added: "That can carry 10 nuclear bombs -- if we used them, it would be as if Europe had never existed." Putin denied earlier this week that the parade was intended as saber-rattling. "However, it is a demonstration of our growing potential in the defence sphere," he told ministers. "We are able to protect our people, our citizens, our state, our wealth - which is not inconsiderable". Military attaches from Russia's traditional arms clients Venezuela, India, China and Africa turned out in force for the parade, many snapping shots of the 46-tonne T-90 tanks and videoing the giant Topol-M nuclear missile launchers. But Western military analysts have been less impressed. They say Moscow's flamboyant rhetoric and occasional military shows of force mask deep, unsolved problems of men, equipment and money inside Russia's armed forces. Putin poured money into the defence budget over his eight years in office but critics say much of the cash failed to reach the front line, where troops are still badly paid, poorly housed and relying on outdated weaponry. Despite the echoes of the Soviet past, the authorities were keen to bury some Communist traditions. Medvedev and Putin watched the parade from an ordinary viewing platform, rather than from atop the mausoleum containing the mummified body of Lenin as Soviet leaders used to do. The red stone mausoleum was shrouded in a hoarding displaying the Russian flag, completely hiding it from view.
