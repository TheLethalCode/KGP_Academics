 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government issued a circular Monday, easing a ban on indoor politics all across the country, with a series of conditions attached. The circular issued by the home ministry allows political parties to hold meetings indoors. But there will be no meetings in open places, according to the circular. The political parties have to inform the police about any meeting, 48 hours ahead of its start. But the electronic media will not be allowed to broadcast the meetings live, but the media can cover the meetings in scheduled news bulletins. Political parties will not be able to use loudspeakers for the meetings. The meetings will take decisions only on organisational activities and elections. No other discussions are allowed, according to the circular. The government has limited the venues for meetings to houses, community centres, hotels, restaurants and party offices. bdnews
