 Baghdad,May 15(bdnews24.com/reuters) - Clashes between Shi'ite militiamen and security forces in Baghdad's Sadr City slum killed seven people and wounded 19 overnight, Iraqi police and hospitals said on Thursday. The dead were all men and the wounded included three women and three children, they said. The US military says fighting in the stronghold of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has eased since Saturday when Sadr's opposition movement in parliament reached an agreement with the ruling Shi'ite alliance to end the violence there. But sporadic clashes have continued and it is unclear how much control the anti-American Sadr has over some of the tens of thousands of gunmen in Iraq who profess allegiance to him. The US military says the violence is being carried out by rogue elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, which it says are armed, trained and funded by Iran. Tehran denies the charges.
