<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Wednesday that a recent report by a US trade union organisation on alleged labour rights abuses in Bangladesh's shrimp industry was unsubstantiated. The adviser told a meeting at the commerce ministry that the report was not objective and was based on old statistics, according to a Press Information Department statement. The American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations, a voluntary federation of 56 national and international labour unions, in the report "The True Cost of Shrimp" said Bangladesh shrimp industry uses child labourers and exploits women workers. The report on shrimp industries in Bangladesh and Thailand was published last month and was broadcast on CNN. The adviser described the report as propaganda and said information in the report was "inconsistent with the present situation". "A vested quarter is plotting against Bangladesh's second highest foreign currency earner: shrimp industry," Rahman said. In a bdnews24.com report, shrimp industry leaders had also dismissed the allegations of extensive worker and rights abuses. The report says a number of organisations have identified "extensive worker and human rights abuses" in the shrimp industry. Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed, fisheries and livestock secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, acting labour and employment secretary Dr Mahfuzul Haque, Bangladesh Shrimp Foundation chairman Syed Mahmudul Haque and Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association president Kazi Belayet Hossain attended the meeting at the commerce ministry. bdnews
