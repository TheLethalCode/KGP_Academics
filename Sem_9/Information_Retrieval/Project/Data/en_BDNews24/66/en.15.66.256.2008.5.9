 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh women's cricket team Friday ended their Women's Asia Cup campaign on a losing streak when they faced a massive nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka at Welagedara Stadium, Kurunegala, Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, who have already set their final clash with India, raced to 123 for one in 25.5 overs, chasing an easy target of 121 set by Bangladesh. Rumana Ahmed dismissed opener Kumarihami (14) to reduce Sri Lanka to 42 for one in 14.1 overs, but the effort was not enough to salvage Bangladesh from their fifth defeat in six matches. Opener Silva remained unbeaten on 66 balls along with Siriwardene (20) to steer Sri Lanka home in half way of the game. Silva struck a dozen fours facing 82 balls. After being put in to bat first, Bangladesh lost both openers Shathira Jakir (5) and Shukhtara (0) for seven runs before Ayesha Akhter played a patient 30 off 75 balls that included five fours. Middle order batswomen Salma Khatun (19), Chamely Khatun (19) and Irin Sultana (18) crossed the double digits as Bangladesh went beyond the 100-mark. Janakanthymala and Sriwardene grabbed three wickets each while Kumarihami and de Alwis took one wicket apiece to wipe the Bangladesh innings. Of six matches, Bangladesh won only one match against Pakistan in the first-leg, but went down against the same rivals in the second-leg match. Besides, Bangladesh lost both matches against India and Sri Lanka. b
