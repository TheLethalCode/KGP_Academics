 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said Monday the chief adviser's address to the nation disappointed the nation. "We hoped the chief adviser would make things clear about the release of Sheikh Hasina. But there was nothing about it in his speech," Zillur told bdnews24.com shortly after the CA ended his televised speech. The AL leader said the chief adviser did not say anything about the withdrawal of the state of emergency either. "He announced the lifting of the ban on indoor politics. But we have to run door to door in the administration for permission if we want to gather more than 50," he said. He said there was nothing new in the CA's speech. He said nothing about the existing problems of the country or the solutions. bdnews
