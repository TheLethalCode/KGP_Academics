<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Monday fixed May 18 to decide if charges would be framed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the barge-mounted power plant case. Judge Firoz Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 fixed the date after hearing the case against Hasina involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three power plants during her term as prime minister. Hasina was taken to the Special Judge's Court, set up in the Sangsad Bhaban, from special jail at 9:50am. Monday's hearing was held on an appeal to withdraw all charges against former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, another accused in the case. Earlier, the court on April 30 had wrapped up the hearing on a similar plea by Hasina to quash the charges against her. The detained Awami League president filed a writ petition Sunday with the High Court challenging validity of proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant case as the trial was not completed in time. Monjila Faruq submitted an affidavit on behalf of Sheikh Hasina Sunday at the HC bench of Justice Md Iman Ali and Justice Md Emdadul Haque. The hearing on the writ petition is likely to be held on Monday. In the writ petition, Hasina sought an order declaring proceedings of the case illegal as the trial had not been completed in 60 days as prescribed by law. She appealed to the court to stay proceedings of the case until a verdict on the writ petition was delivered. Hasina's counsel barrister Shafiq Ahmed said a person arrested by joint forces would have to be sent to the Anticorruption Commission in 48 hours from the time of arrest according to the ACC law. "An investigation has to be done within 60 days of filing the case. The trial has to be completed in 60 days from the judge taking the charges into cognisance," Shafiq said. The Anticorruption Commission filed the barge-mounted power plant graft case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2 last year against eight people, including Hasina. The graft watchdog accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribe from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. bdnew
