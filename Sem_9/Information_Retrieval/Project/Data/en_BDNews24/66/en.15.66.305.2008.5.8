 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will face an uphill task to ensure their AFC Challenge Cup's finals berth when they take on hosts Kyrgyzstan in the Group C last match in Bishkek Friday. Bangladesh, who were held to a goalless against Afghanistan in the opener, have no other way except at least a 2-0 win against the Central Asian nation if Bangladesh want to qualify for the eight-team finals in the Indian city Hyderabad. Afghanistan stunned Kyrgyzstan 1-0 to top the three-team points table with four points from two outings and have kept their eyes on the result of the last match between Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan. If the hosts win the match against Bangladesh, Afghanistan will be in the finals. Abu Yousuf side's have to show something extraordinary against Kyrgyzstan as the statistics is in favour of the hosts, who thrashed Bangladesh 3-0 in the Nehru Cup last year in the first-ever meeting against the South Asian nation. After losing to Afghanistan, Kyrgyz coach Nematjan Zakirov warned that they would push hard on Bangladesh to give something to the home crowd. "We don't want to let down our spectators and will try hard to beat Bangladesh in the final game," said Zakirov. After going down against Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan will no doubt be a wounded lion and try to slap Bangladesh in their final match, but the visitors have to show enough nerve to fulfill their dream of playing the finals. Bangladesh, however, miss the service of defender Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, who was given the marching orders in the dying minutes against Afghanistan.
