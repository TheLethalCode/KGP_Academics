 Yangon, May 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's prime minister announced on Friday that he would fly to cyclone-stricken Myanmar this weekend after British and American envoys urged him to ask the ruling generals to open the door to Western aid. Samak Sundaravej's move came after Washington expressed outrage with the Myanmar junta over delays in allowing in aid for a country where, according to a United Nations estimate, 1.5 million people have been "severely affected" by the cyclone. Despairing survivors awaited emergency relief on Friday, almost a week after Cyclone Nargis roared across the farms and villages of the low-lying Irrawaddy delta region, killing perhaps as many as 100,000 people. "I have already contacted them (Myanmar's militatry rulers). I will see them on Sunday," Samak told reporters after meeting British Ambassador Quinton Quayle in Bangkok. The U.N. food agency and Red Cross/Red Crescent said on Thursday they had finally started flying in emergency relief supplies after foot-dragging by Myanmar's leaders. The United States, however, was waiting for approval to start military flights. "We're outraged by the slowness of the response of the government of Burma to welcome and accept assistance," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad told reporters. "It's clear that the government's ability to deal with the situation, which is catastrophic, is limited." The U.S. Navy said four ships, including the destroyer USS Mustin and the three-vessel Essex Expeditionary Strike Force, were heading for Myanmar from the Gulf of Thailand after the Essex deployed helicopters to Thailand for aid operations. Witnesses have seen little evidence of a relief effort in the delta that was swamped in Saturday's cyclone -- the worst since 1991, when 143,000 people were killed in neighboring Bangladesh. Towns and hamlets in the Irrawaddy Delta were helping themselves in the absence of any outside aid. "There are more than 1,000 people down there on the outskirts of Laputta," said one resident. "It's a refugee camp. Water is a big problem. So many people from here have made donations. They have given rice, vegetables and noodles." Asked if survivors were angry at the regime, he said: "They need food and family. They don't need revolution." INFLUX OF FOREIGNERS Some critics accuse the junta of stalling because they do not want an influx of foreigners into the countryside during Saturday's referendum on the army-drafted constitution that looks set to cement the military's grip on power. The plebiscite has been postponed for two weeks in areas worst-hit by the storm. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was seeking direct talks with the junta's senior general, Than Shwe, to persuade him to remove obstacles. A U.N. spokeswoman said Ban believed it might be "prudent" for the government to postpone the referendum. U.N. humanitarian affairs chief John Holmes questioned the value of voicing outrage with the junta over the aid delays. "It's not clear to me at this stage anyway that bludgeoning them over the head is going to make any difference or make it any better. We have to work with them," he told U.S. National Public Radio. Washington is hoping to get approval to send in a plane with aid that is ready to fly. Approval for such a flight would be significant, given the huge distrust and acrimony between the former Burma's generals and Washington, which has imposed tough sanctions to try to end 46 years of military rule. 'RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT' The storm pulverized the Irrawaddy delta with 120 miles per hour winds followed by a 12-foot (3.7-metre) wave that leveled villages and caused most of the casualties and damage. While Holmes said the United Nations estimated at least 1.5 million people were "severely affected", Britain's U.N. ambassador, John Sawers, said it may be in the millions. Myanmar state television did not give an update on Thursday night of the official death toll, which stood at 22,980 with 42,119 missing as of Tuesday. Diplomats and disaster experts said the real figure is likely to be much higher. Shari Villarosa, charge d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in Myanmar, said on Wednesday the death toll may exceed 100,000. U.N. officials who had earlier complained the generals were putting up obstacles to an emergency airlift, said half a dozen cargo planes had been allowed to land at Yangon airport. France has suggested invoking a U.N. "responsibility to protect" to deliver aid to Myanmar without government approval. But its bid to make the Security Council take a stand has been rebuffed by China, Vietnam, South Africa and Russia. Indonesia and China spoke against politicizing the issue. Sawers, the British envoy, suggested that Britain also had doubts about invoking the "responsibility to protect" idea. "That (concept) relates to acts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and so forth, rather than responses to natural disasters," Sawers told reporters.
