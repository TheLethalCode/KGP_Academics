 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Sunday deferred a hearing on charge-framing in the MiG-29 warplanes graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to May 19. Dhaka divisional judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder shifted the date after former army chief Mustafizur Rahman, another accused in the case, failed to attend the hearing because of his illness. Lawyers for Rahman submitted two appeals to the courtone pleaded for four more weeks' time and another appealed to the government for sending the accused abroad for better treatment. After hearing arguments of the counsels of the state and the defence, the court reset May 19 to deliver orders on the appeals. Hasina was taken to the special courtroom in the Sangsad Bhaban from special jail around 10am. On May 4, the judge deferred the date for the MiG-29 case hearing to May 11 for the same reason: the illness of the former army chief. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official of the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001 with Tejgaon Police Station against seven, including Hasina alleging malpractice. The case details said the government incurred losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore due to the skewed purchase of the eight MiG-29 warplanes in 1999 during Hasina's tenure as prime minister. Hasina had appealed to the High Court in 2003 to cancel the case, which was rejected, but the court stayed the case proceedings. bdnews24.co
