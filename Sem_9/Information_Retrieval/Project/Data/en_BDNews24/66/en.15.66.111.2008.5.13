 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks ended lower for a second day, mainly due to sell-offs in banks and non-bank financial institutions and price correction of IFIC bank. Investors bought heavily into mutual funds and pharmaceuticals shares and sold off majors in banks and non-bank financial institutions Tuesday, according to an official with brokerage house Latif Securities. State-run oil entities and power shares fell due to profit-taking, added the official. Turnover and the trading volume on the country's twin bourses recorded a substantial increase from the previous day. Market observers said that the fall was expected as massive selling usually occurred after a couple of days of flat trading. "Usually the bourse witnesses this (huge sell-offs) following a few days of flat trading," DSE vice president Ahmad Rashid Lali told bdnews24.com. He added that investors might go for portfolio reshaping in the wake of the liquidity crisis. "Price correction of IFIC Bank also influenced the indices to go down," said the DSE vice president. The DGEN or general index fell sharply at the opening bell due to price correction and maintained a downward curve across the day to fall 55.13 points or 1.78 percent to close at 3026.23.

Turnover rose to Tk 3.70 billion from Monday's Tk 2.99 billion through 28,759,023 shares changing hands. Of the traded issues, 91 gained and 132 lost, with 16 issues holding steady. Market major Square Pharmaceuticals topped the turnover board and gained 5.45 percent to Tk 5143.75. AB Bank followed it to end on Tk 4120.50, down 2.35 percent. AIMS 1st Mutual Fund advanced 7.86 percent to Tk 14.68 while IFIC Bank slumped 48.91 percent to Tk 1498.50 due to price correction following corporate declarations. A buying spree in mutual funds led Grameen Mutual Fund One to close 3.18 percent higher at Tk 135.90. Among the other scrips on the turnover board, state-run Jamuna Oil, Apex Adelchi Footwear, Union Capital and Lanka Bangla Finance lost after investors locked in profits. Z Category scrip UCBL saw its price go up.
