 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh's hope of playing the finals of the AFC Challenge Cup was dashed when hosts Kyrgyzstan came from behind to beat the visitors 2-1 in the qualifying round of Group C at Spartak Stadium in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Friday. Kyrgyzstan's triumph threw Afghanistan into the eight-team finals to be held in the Indian city of Hyderabad from July 30 to August 10. Afghanistan finished Group C top with one win and one draw to collect four points, one point ahead of Kyrgyzstan. Bangladesh finished bottom in three-team meet with one point from two outings. Bangladesh took to field with a must-win attitude against their superior side, whose hope of playing the finals was destroyed after being defeated 1-0 to Afghanistan in their first match. Bangladesh had a good opportunity to qualify for the final round of the AFC Challenge Cup had they won against Kyrgyzstan on at least a 2-1 margin Friday. On way to fulfilling the dream, the Bangladeshis started well after the barren first half with striker Jahid Hasan Emily giving Bangladesh a 63-minute lead through an accurate header. But, they failed to keep the momentum against a more physically fit Kyrgyz and Roman Karnilov pulled the goal back in the 83rd minute before Ruslan Sydykov sealed the match for the home side three minutes from time. "I had high expectations from my team before this tournament. I will continue working for the development of our football and we will develop physically to play better in other tournaments," said Bangladesh coach Abu Yusuf according to the-afc.com, the official website of the Asian Football Confederation. Kyrygyzstan coach Nematjan Zakirov said he felt devastated despite the win. "We should have qualified for the main tournament. We had the best team. I am glad with today's win but with tears in my eyes," said Zakirov.
