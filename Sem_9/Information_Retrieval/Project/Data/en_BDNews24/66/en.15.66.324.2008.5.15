 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Former ministers MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam, two of the 12 "fugitives" in the GATCO graft case, submitted appeals with the High Court seeking anticipatory bail Thursday. The lawyers of the two bail petitioners tried to arrange hearing on the petitions Thursday; but a particular bench said it would not accept any petition seeking anticipatory bail while another said they accept such petitions for hearing on Sunday. The court has issued arrest warrants against 12 accused in GATCO case, including former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Motiur Rahman Nizamt, M Shamsul Islam and Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and also ordered confiscation of their assets. Judge Azizul Haque of Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court handed down the verdict at 10 am. Noor Alam, assistant record keeper of the concerned court told bdnews24.com that the court simultaneously ordered the police to produce the detained accused in the court on May 22 and submit report in the court if the fugitive accused could be arrested by then. The Anticorruption Commission on May 13 pressed charges against detained former premier Khaleda Zia, her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, Nizami and 22 others in the GATCO graft case. As accused former shipping minister Akbar Hossain died, it has been suggested that his name may be dropped from the chargesheet. The chargesheet showed 12 of the accused including M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar, Ameer Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami absconding. bdnew
