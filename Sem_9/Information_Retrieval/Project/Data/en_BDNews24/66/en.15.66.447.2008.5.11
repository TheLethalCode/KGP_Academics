<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) bid to sell sponsorship rights for the upcoming one-day international series involving India, Pakistan and Bangladesh next month has drawn disappointing response. The board Sunday received bids worth US$ 5.65 lakh against the board's plan to raise US$ 10 lakh for three sponsorship rights: Title Sponsorship Rights (floor price US$ 5 lakh), In-stadia Advertising Rights Package-1 (floor price US$ 2.5 lakh) and In-stadia Advertising Rights Package-2 (floor price US$ 2.5 lakh). Bidding for the sponsorship rights of the tri-nation series opened Sunday at the BCB management office in Gulshan. Only In-stadia Advertising Rights Package-1 received good response with Bottomline, a bidder, offering to pay US$ 20,000 more than the floor price. But the response to the other packages were disappointing as bidder Adtouch offered the board US$ 2 lakh for the title sponsorship, while the board has got highest US$ 95,000 offer for In-Stadia Advertising Package-2. "We haven't got good response from the bidders in two sponsorship rights and Adtouch and Axiom Technologies have been asked to re-bid for title sponsorship," said BCB media committee chairman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby. Bottomline, Adtouch and Axiom Technologies have also been asked to revise their bids for the In-stadia Advertising Package-2 on Monday, he added. Bobby also said they would sell both sponsorship rights at the price quoted on Sunday if the response in the Monday's re-bidding fell short of their expectations. b
