<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division on Thursday cleared the way for the trial court to continue the proceedings of an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. In a verdict, the appeals court overturned an order by the High Court that had scrapped the case. The government had appealed the HC verdict. A full bench of chief justice Md Ruhul Amin delivered Thursday's verdict. Instantly reacting to the verdict, Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said the order "was a violation of both basic and constitutional rights of a citizen". Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said, "The Appellate Division has granted the government appeal, which means the trial of the case will continue." The court wrapped up the hearing into the appeal on April 29 in the case. The Appellate Division on Feb 26 granted the government permission for a formal appeal against the HC verdict and put freezes on the judgement. The HC scrapped the case on Feb 6. Chowdhury filed the case against Hasina and another Awami League leader, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim on June 13 last year with Gulshan Police Station accusing them of extorting approximately Tk 3 crore from him. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana had also been implicated in the case later. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 at Sudha Sadan in Dhanmondi and showed her arrested in the case bringing it under emergency powers rules. bdnew
