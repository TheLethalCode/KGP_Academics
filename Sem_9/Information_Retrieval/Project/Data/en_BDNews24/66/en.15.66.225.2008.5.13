 MIAMI, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels has been provisionally suspended after he was been found guilty of breaching regulations after a probe into allegations of links with a bookmaker, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said on Monday. Samuels, 27, is now out of the game under a mandatory two-year ban which is effective from May 9 unless the International Cricket Council (ICC) offers him a reprieve. "It is up to the ICC now," said Tony Deyal, head of communications for the WICB. "They reserve the right to review and if necessary re-open it. It is up to them and they will now take it to their executive," he said, adding that Samuels was however out of the first test against Australia which starts on May 22 in Kingston, Jamaica. The WICB said their disciplinary committee had found that Samuels had breached ICC Rules of Conduct 4 in that he "received money, benefit or other reward which could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute." The committee looked into charges that Jamaican Samuels passed on team information to a bookmaker during a one-day series in India in January 2007. "They looked at the circumstances -- he did take the money but there was no proof that there was a link, that he provided information," said Deyal. On that basis, a second charge that Samuels had "directly or indirectly... engaged in conduct prejudicial to the interests of the game," was dismissed, added Deyal. Deyal said the investigation had found that Samuels had a hotel room paid for by the bookmaker and was unable to produce proof that he repaid the loan. The committee, which will now pass on its findings to the ICC, said they would prefer for Samuels not to face a ban but to be "bound over to be of good behaviour for a period not exceeding two years." An aggressive right-handed batsman and useful off-spinner, Samuels has played in 29 tests and 107 one-day internationals
