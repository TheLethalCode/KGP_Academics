<TITLE> Canadian baby boomers feeling neglected: survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Toronto, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - The baby boom generation that was once the dominant influence on everything from fashion to haircuts to music is getting older and feeling increasingly ignored by advertisers, even though boomers are well-heeled and willing to spend their money, according to a Canadian poll. Of the nearly 2,000 Canadians between the ages of 44 and 62 surveyed online, 8 in 10 said they had the money to buy what they want, but 4 in 10 felt ignored by advertisers. The survey found over 70 percent of advertising dollars were being spent to attract a younger demographic, between the ages of 25 to 54. "Everything that is marketed seems to be marketed though the lens of what's cool for that younger audience," said Anne Kothawala, president and CEO of the Canadian Newspaper Association which commissioned the poll by Ipsos Reid. "The boomers are the ones who actually have more money. They're mature and they know what they want. They think of themselves as cool and very few of the advertising dollars available are actually being targeted directly at boomers," Kothawala said. From a list of things the huge baby boom generation is willing to spend money on, 39 percent said a vacation was their top priority over the next year, 35 percent said electronics and 31 percent said furniture. Investing, new appliances, cars and computers were also on the list, though respondents from nearly all regions of Canada said a vacation was No. 1.
