<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier League champions Manchester United are determined to build on their latest success and will strengthen their squad to do so, chief executive David Gill said. United clinched their 17th league title on Sunday and if they go on to beat Chelsea in the Champions League final on May 21, manager Alex Ferguson has said he would regard this as the best team in his 21 years at Old Trafford. Regardless of this season's achievements, Ferguson is set to add to his squad in the summeran experienced striker such as Tottenham's Dimitar Berbatov is top of his listwith the full backing of the United board. "Like any club, whether you are bottom, middle or the top you assess what's gone well, what hasn't gone so well and where you feel you can improve. And we will certainly be in a position whereby if we can improve it, we will," Gill told MUTV. "Alex would never let us rest on our laurels so we have to do that. You can clearly see intent. Tottenham have made a big signing already for next season (Croatian midfielder Luka Modric), Everton have done very well to get fifth spot and Aston Villa have really made great strides. "I think it is the best league in the world and therefore if we want to continue being at the top we have to make sure we look at the squad, improve it and ensure that we have this again next year and celebrate another win. That's our plan, anyway." DOUBLE CHANCE Before then, United have the chance to seal a double of domestic and European honours, which Gill said would be a fitting way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster in which eight of the club's players were killed. "It would be absolutely wonderful if we could secure a third Champions League in our history and 50 years after Munich it would be absolutely fantastic," said Gill. United begin their preparations for the Moscow final in earnest when they return to training on Tuesday and Ferguson was optimistic about their prospects after they held off Chelsea's title challenge with a 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic on Sunday. "We've a great chance. There is a mood generated from that result that sees us in a very confident position," Ferguson told MUTV. "It won't be easy. Cup finals are not easy. We expect a tough game but we expect Manchester United to express themselves in a fantastic way." England's footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo added United's player of the year award to his collection at Old Trafford on Sunday night, just hours after scoring his 41st goal of the season in the decisive win at Wigan
