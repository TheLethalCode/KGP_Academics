<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday issued a rule nisi on a writ petition filed by Awami League president Sheikh Hasina challenging the proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant case against her as the trial was not completed in time. The HC asked the government, the Anticorruption Commission and the Special Judge's Court-1 for Dhaka to explain the delay in trial in eight days. The HC bench of justices Md Iman Ali and Md Emdadul Haque made the ruling, but did not put freezes on the trial proceedings of the case. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, who took part in the hearing on behalf of Hasina, said: "As per law, the trial of the barge-mounted power plant case was supposed to be completed in 60 days from the court charges into cognisance." "It is illegal to continue the proceedings as the trial is not completed by the deadline." "An investigation has to be done within 60 days from the filing of a case," the lawyer said. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking bribe in return for allowing three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna and using the money for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. The court received the chargesheet on Jan 10, but the case is still dragging on. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 20 last year. The case is now on trial at Dhaka No. 1 Special Judge's Court. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 last year. bdnew
