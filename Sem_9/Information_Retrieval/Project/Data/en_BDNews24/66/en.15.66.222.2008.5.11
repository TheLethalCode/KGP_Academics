<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was produced in the court of Dhaka divisional judge Golam Mortuza for hearing on charge-framing in a graft case which involved the purchase of eight MiG-29 warplanes during her tenure in office as prime minister. Sheikh Hasina was escorted to the special courtroom from the special jail at 10 am in the morning. Earlier on May 4, Judge Golam Mortuza of Dhaka Divisional Judge's Court set up in the Sangsad Bhaban shifted the date for hearing on charge framing in the MiG-29 case to May 11 as another accused in the case former army chief General (retd) Mustafizur Rahman failed to attend the hearing because of his illness. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official of the now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001 with Tejgaon Police Station against seven including Hasina alleging malpractice. The case details said the government incurred losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore due to the skewed purchase of the eight MiG-29 warplanes in 1999 during Hasina's tenure as prime minister. Hasina had appealed to the High Court in 2003 to cancel the case, which was rejected, but the court stayed the case proceedings. bdnew
