<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Friday the pro-reform faction of the party would hopefully ponder a little and learn a lesson from the GATCO case. His comment came a day after the Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against some reformist leaders of BNP in the Gatco graft case. At the same time, Delwar condemned the inclusion of former prime minister Khaleda Zia in the Gatco case chargesheet. "It's a pity that our popular leader has been implicated in this fabricated Gatco case. This has been done to malign and keep her off the political scene," Delwar told reporters on his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat. The chargesheet named 24 people, including former finance minister M Saifur Rahman and former local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, as co-accused with Khaleda. Delwar said people would never accept a "heinous design" of some quarters who want a "kowtowing government" to emerge from the forthcoming polls, banishing two leaders-Khaleda and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. He hopes that his party will win the majority of electoral seats if the elections are held properly and fairly with the two leaders leading their parties. Criticising the judiciary, he said: "The hand of justice has been seemingly curbed and painted black. It curtailed the last refuge of the poor and the helpless. But the Appellate Division has failed to fulfil the expectations of the grassroots people." Replying to a query, Delwar said: "After the names of some former ministers surfaced in the Gatco case, they have come to realise that this ploy has been marketed to destroy politicians." "I hope they will now realise that a wildfire doesn't know any direction. It just loves to spread," he said. The press briefing was also attended by BNP vice-president Sarwari Rahman, joint secretary general Selima Rahman and acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. bdnew
