 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The Indian Border Security Force has come out openly for the first time to say that coordination with the BDR to manage the Indo-Bangladesh border is better than ever before. But the BSF alleges that there is no doubt that insurgents from Northeast India are carrying out their activities primarily from Bangladesh soil. "We do have reasons to believe that they (insurgents) are there. But I can understand that the BDR cannot do much because it's beyond the charter of the BDR to act in the hinterland," said Ashish K Mitra, director general of BSF, in a recent exclusive interview with bdnews24.com. Mitra has expressed his surprise that the BDR is claiming that people like United Liberation Front of Assam leader Paresh Barua, one of India's most wanted, is not in Bangladesh. "How can I stop them from saying anything or making such statements? I don't know why they are talking because these are government-level decisions and their government needs to act," he said. But the BSF chief has reiterated that the relations with the BDR have improved "tremendously" in the last 12 months. "Recently they returned the weapon of one of our jawans, which was snatched by Bangladeshi farmers who were illegally farming on the international border. Can you imagine such cooperation even some time back?" Mitra said.
