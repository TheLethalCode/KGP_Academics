 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government Wednesday condemned bomb blasts that killed at least 60 people in Joypur in India. "It was a mindless and shameful act that deserves condemnation in the strongest term," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters in his office. Terming it a terrorist attack, the adviser said: "They are terrorists who have done this sordid and heinous deed." "Our hearts reach out to the families of the victims and we have sympathies with the Indian authorities," Iftekhar said. On Indian media reports linking attacks to outlawed Bangladeshi Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad, the adviser said: "The media should not jump to a conclusion. A thorough investigation is needed." bdnews
