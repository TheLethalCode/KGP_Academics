 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday issued a contempt of court rule against textiles and jute secretary Abdur Rashid Sarker for neglecting a 1997 verdict. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation chairman Md Ataharul Islam, Board of Investment director Shamsul Alam Talukder and Privatisation Commission chairman Md Abu Solaiman Chowdhury are facing the same charges. The HC asked them to explain why contempt proceedings would not be drawn up against them for violating the HC judgment of 1997 in a writ petition which directed the government to hand over the possession of Aleem Jute in Khulna to Shilpa Pratisthan. The verdict had been upheld by the Appellate Division. Upon an application filed by Shilpa Pratisthan, the HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahmed passed the order. The HC also directed those under the contempt order to appear in court on to explain their conduct. Barrister Masood Reza Sobhan, assisted by barrister Fatema Sobhan Chowdhury, moved the application. bd
