 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday passed an arrest warrant for 12 "fugitives" in the GATCO scam case. Former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Motiur Rahman Nizami, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar and Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury were among them. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Hoque passed the order. Mohammad Zahirul Huda, deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission and investigating officer of the case, submitted a chargesheet against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 24 others to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Tuesday. The chargesheet was transferred to the court of judge Md Azizul Hoque Wednesday. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman Coco with ties to the case on Sept 3 last year. Khaleda and other accused behind bars have been asked to appear in court on May 22. The ACC filed the case on Sept 2 with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people alleging that GATCO's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Rail station. The accused awarded the contract to GATCO although the company failed to meet all the conditions. It is also alleged that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the GATCO deal. bd
