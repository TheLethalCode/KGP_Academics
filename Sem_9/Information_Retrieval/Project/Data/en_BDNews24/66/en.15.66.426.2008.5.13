 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) --Orascom Telecom that owns Banglalink seeks to diversify investment into the banking sector in Bangladesh, said its visiting chairman Tuesday. The Egyptian company has also expressed interest in investing in cement, fertiliser and tourism sectors. Orascom has so far invested $700 million in telecoms in Bangladesh, the company's chairman Naguib Sawiris told reporters Tuesday. Orascom plans to spend a further $350 million this year on network expansion and infrastructure. Sawiris who arrived in Dhaka Tuesday spoke to reporters at the Banglalink office and had a meeting with BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam at Radisson. Sawiris said: "Besides telecommunications, we want to invest in Bangladesh in other sectors. We are interested in investing in the banking sector and have already applied for a licence to run banking business." On the telecoms sector, he said the number of Banglalink subscribers would cross the 10 million mark this year. "There are problems regarding spectrum and tax. Tax has to be reduced," he said. Sawiris claimed that none in Banglalink was involved in VoIP business. If anybody are found involved, action will be taken against him, he said. After the meeting with Sawiris, Manzurul Alam said that Orascom had expressed interest to invest in the submarine cable and optical fibre network in Bangladesh. bdnews
