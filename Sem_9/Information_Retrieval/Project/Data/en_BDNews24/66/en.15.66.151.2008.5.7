<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has decided to hold three meets including the Federation Cup and the B. League in the next five months. The decision was taken Wednesday at the first meeting of the newly elected BFF executive committee with federation president Kazi Salahuddin in the chair. The committee Tuesday agreed in principle about two meets before the B. League in an unofficial meeting, and okayed it at the official meeting. "The BFF executive committee had met in a very congenial atmosphere where some important decisions were taken to keep football in the field. We have decided to hold the Federation Cup, the B. League and another tournament in the next five months," former football superstar Salahuddin told reporters after the meeting at the BFF House. Salahuddin said that they had kept the previous schedule of the booters' transfer unchanged and it would start from May 15 to continue to June 20 before the B. League getting underway in September. To make the B. League a success, BFF senior vice president Salam Murshidi and vice president Kazi Nabil Ahmed have been named chairman and vice chairman of the B. League Committee. "We hope the B. League will be a very attractive league instead of a traditional one, and you will understand it seeing the arrangement for it," said the BFF boss. Salahuddin said that the federation cup would be held by July-August, but could not make clear what kind of another tournament would be held after the federation cup. It was, however, learnt the BFF wants to organise an international tournament to boost the local football, and they would reveal details after confirming participating teams and sponsorship. The meeting also saw formation of an emergency committee comprising Salahuddin, Salam Murshidi, four vice presidents Manzoor Hossain Malu, Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir and Kazi Nabil and four members of Anwarul Haq Helal, Harun-or-Rashid, Sirajul Islam Bacchu and Golam Rabbani Helal. The meeting also formed two other standing committees, the national team committee headed by Badal Roy and the finance committee headed by Anwarul Haq Helal. Salahuddin also said that they were considering holding the school football in Dhaka and Chittagong at the same time and the BFF would examine playgrounds in both cities.
