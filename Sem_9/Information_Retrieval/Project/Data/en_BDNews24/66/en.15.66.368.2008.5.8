 Dhaka, May 08 (bdnews24.com)The United States wants to see an elected government taking power at the start of next year. US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs Richard A Boucher has said his country also wants to see the stability of the new government. "Domestically you are on a path to democracy. It is important for us to see the path completed by the end of the year," the visiting US official told reporters Thursday after holding talks with foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain at the foreign ministry. "We talked about how the Election Commission and how the government will be working to make sure the election happens on time. "We see a democratically elected government emerge in Bangladesh from next year, but also see the guarantee for democracy that is put in place to continue on a stable basis in the long term," said Boucher who arrived in the city early Thursday on a two-day visit. He is scheduled to meet chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief Moeen U Ahmed Thursday. "In addition to democracy and development, one of the main issues for us is denial of space for terrorists," said Boucher who last visited Bangladesh in late 2006. Boucher was accompanied by the US State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism Dell L Dailey. They met with the officials of the home and law ministries too. Boucher praised Bangladesh's role in eliminating terrorism and extremism and sought further cooperation to root out terrorists. "We are here with broad agenda. The agenda I think speaks to the desires and need to the people of Bangladesh," he said. Boucher said the US could help people achieve restoration of democracy, achieving economic development and peaceful society. He said a strong Election Commission, Human Rights Commission and Anticorruption Commission could strengthen shore up democracy in Bangladesh. bdn
