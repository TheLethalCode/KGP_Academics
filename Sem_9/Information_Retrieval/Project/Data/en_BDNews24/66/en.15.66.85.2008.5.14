 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks ended almost flat Wednesday with indices and turnover edging down. Sell-offs in banks continued, with pharmaceuticals joining the club Wednesday. Non-bank financial institutions enjoyed a buying spree, an official with brokerage house IDLC Securities told bdnews24.com. Investors also opted for privately managed mutual funds as well as some insurers, added the official. Market watchers said the flat closing was logical as the market is running short of liquidity. "Investors are not getting access to funds so they have to opt for mixed portfolios of buying and selling to trade," DSE vice president Ahmad Rashid Lali told bdnews24.com. He added that the bourse would see more of flat trading because of the liquidity crisis. The DGEN or general index remained relatively stable across the day and slipped 6.48 points or 0.21 percent to close at 3019.75. The DSI or all-share price index ended on 2561.72, falling 1.18 points or 0.04 percent from the previous day. The bourse's blue chip DSE-20 shed 17.81 points or 0.73 percent to 2403.95.

AB Bank topped the turnover board and fell 0.70 percent to Tk 4091.50. AIMS 1st Mutual Fund ended on Tk 15.65, up 6.60 percent.
