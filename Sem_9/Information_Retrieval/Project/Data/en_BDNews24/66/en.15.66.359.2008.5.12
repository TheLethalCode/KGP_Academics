 Islamabad,May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif pledged on Monday to maintain support for Pakistan's 6-week old coalition, whatever the party decides to do over an impasse over the restoration of judges, the prime minister's office said in a statement. Sharif is expected to meet other leaders of his Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), known as the PML-N, before announcing his next step following the failure to break the deadlock during talks over the weekend. There is speculation that PML-N ministers could quit Gilani's cabinet, but maintain support for the coalition from outside the government.
