 MANCHESTER, England, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sven-Goran Eriksson refused to comment on his future in football on Friday as he prepared for what looks likely to be his final game in charge of Manchester City. Portuguese club Benfica confirmed on Thursday that they had held talks about a possible return to the Stadium of Light for the former England coach, who according to widespread media reports is expected to be sacked by City after their game at Middlesbrough on Sunday. Eriksson told reporters: "I have no comment about that. I don't deny it and I don't confirm it. I refuse to answer questions about my future. "I know there has been a lot of speculation but that's speculation. The facts will be known, probably next week. "It has no meaning talking about 'if'. It's better to talk about 'today' when things are sorted." Eriksson believes he has overseen a successful first season in charge of City, who are set to finish no lower than ninth in their premier league after battling against relegation last season. However, the Swede does not believe that club owner Thaksin Shinawatra shares that view, which means Sunday's game looks set to be his last. "It's a possibility, that's not a secret, but nothing is confirmed. Let's play the last game and have a bit of patience," he said. TWO YEARS Shinawatra is thought to be unhappy at how City's results have tailed off in recent months and has been linked with a move for Luiz Felipe Scolari, coach of Portugal. However, Scolari has distanced himself from a possible move to the City of Manchester Stadium, where Shinawatra wants a top-four finish within the next two years, something Eriksson believes is beyond his team. "In gur case it's not realistic, qualifying for the Champions League," Eriksson added. "We are good but we are not that good. We don't have a squad up there with Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. That's a fact and I think anyone who knows about football would agree." City could find themselves in the UEFA Cup next season after England were awarded an extra place for topping Europe's Fair Play rankings. Eriksson has not publicly turned his back on City, whose supporters are due to stage a march in support of him on Saturday, nor ruled out the prospect of staying if Shinawatra has a change of heart. "I like the club, I like the fans and the players we have and I like the project," he said. However, it seems almost certain that Eriksson, 60, will move to another club. "I have been a coach or manager for 27 years and been out of a job for one year, which was the worst of my life. It will be difficult to keep me out of football, I promise you," he said
