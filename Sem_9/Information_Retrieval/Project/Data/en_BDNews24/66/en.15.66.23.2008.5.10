 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com) - Warid Telecom has planned $250 million in new investment for network expansion for its mobile phone subscribers in Bangladesh. Warid's CEO Muneer Farooqui said Saturday at a news briefing that the amount would be spent over the next year, as it signed up three million subscribers since it began operating in Bangladesh last year. Warid, a subsidiary of the UAE-based Abu Dhabi Group, currently stands as the country's fourth-largest cell phone operator. The company has already invested $500 million, and with the new investment the company is hopeful of tapping more subscribers. "Warid Telecom will make fresh investment worth $250 million to enhance network capacity and quality of its growing subscriber base," Farooqui said, as the company commemorated its one year in Bangladesh Saturday. He said the additional investment would complement the existing network to improve the quality of services. The CEO said his company contributed more than Tk 800 crore to the national exchequer as direct and indirect taxes till April this year. The company, which has paid $50 million to obtain licence, has created both direct and indirect jobs for 5,500 Bangladeshi people since it started operations last year. Farooqui said they were ready to expand its services to 64 districts by launching operations in three hill districts. "We are only waiting for the go-ahead from the government," he said. Grameenphone, 62 percent owned by Norway's Telenor, leads the tally with 18 million users, while Banglalink, a subsidiary of the Egypt's Orascom, scores second with more than eight million subscribers. Aktel, Citycell and Teletalk share the rest of the market. Market operators say the number of mobile phone users will reach more than 50 million by 2009. bd
