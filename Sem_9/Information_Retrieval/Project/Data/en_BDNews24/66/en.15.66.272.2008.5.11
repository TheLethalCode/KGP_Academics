 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Sunday reportedly urged senior party leaders from jail to launch a movement to realise the five demands publicised by the party. Hasina's counsel advocate Qamrul Islam having spoken to her after a court hearing conveyed the message to the reporters. The Awami League tabled its five-point of demands during the pre-dialogue informal talks, which constituted Hasina's release, an end to the state of emergency, announcement of the date for general elections, curbs on rising food prices and trial of war criminals. "The five demands will not be possible to realise without launching a movement. Re-establishing democracy, rule of law, protecting human rights and above all, ensuring a free and fair election will be possible only through movement," Islam quoted Hasina as saying. "You will take part in the dialogue after knowing about the government agenda first. The dialogue must be successful," the former prime minister was further quoted as saying. bdnews24.com
