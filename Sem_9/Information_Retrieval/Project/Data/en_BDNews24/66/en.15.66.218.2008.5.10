<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Villarreal President Fernando Roig has praised his side for achieving their highest league finish, securing second place and automatic qualification for the Champions League group stage next year, with two games left to play. "One day I hope we can win the title but coming second is like being champions for us," he said. Barcelona's Brazilian defender Silvinho will be out of action for four weeks with a twisted ligament in his right knee, and joins Ronaldinho, Andres Iniesta, and Gabriel Milito on the injury list for Sunday's visit of Real Mallorca. Xavi is suspended. Samuel Eto'o and Deco return from suspension in a game where the home fans are likely to vent their anger over the 4-1 drubbing at the Bernabeu against arch-rivals Real Madrid. It will be coach Frank Rijkaard's last home game at the helm. Mallorca's Venezuela forward Juan Arango has obtained dual-nationality, freeing up one of the club's three berths for non-European Union players. Striker Daniel Guiza's 25 goals has helped Mallorca accumulate their highest tally in the Primera Liga of 63, with two matches left to play, the club said. Relegation-threatened Real Zaragoza will be without full back Carlos Diogo for the visit of champions Real Madrid. The former Real player has torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and will be out for six months. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid can assure themselves of a place in the Champions League third-qualifying round for next season with a victory over Deportivo Coruna at the Calderon on Sunday. They will be without suspended defender Luis Perea. Sevilla midfielder Seydou Keita is set to return for the city derby away to Real Betis, while the hosts' top scorer, forward Edu, has recovered from muscle problems and is available. Relegated Levante's players have said they will not go on strike for the city derby at home to Valencia on Sunday out of respect for their fans, despite promises from the club two weeks ago to pay up outstanding debts still not being honoured. "I'm sure there aren't any other people in Spain who have only received 20 percent of their salary in two years. We won't accept any more promises," defender Luis Rubiales said
