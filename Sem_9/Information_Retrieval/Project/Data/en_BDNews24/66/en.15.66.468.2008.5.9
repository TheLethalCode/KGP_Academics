 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Amy Winehouse has been released from police custody following her arrest on suspicion of drug offenses, police sources said on Thursday. The Grammy-winning soul singer, who was arrested less than two weeks ago in an unrelated assault case and released with a warning, was detained again on Wednesday after turning herself in at an East London police station and was questioned by detectives for more than nine hours. Her latest arrest stems from a video published by a British tabloid newspaper showing the singer smoking what it said was crack cocaine. The 24-year-old entertainer has not been charged. "At 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Wednesday, a 24-year-old woman attended a London police station by arrangement," police said in a statement. "She was arrested in connection with alleged possession of a controlled drug." A spokeswoman said on Thursday that the woman, based in Camden, north London, was released on bail until later this month pending further inquiries. She did not name the woman and declined to give more details. Media reports said Winehouse appeared anguished and disheveled as she arrived at the Limehouse police station. She was held overnight in a cell last month but was released without charge after admitting assault by slapping a man. The latest Sunday Times Rich List said Winehouse, whose battle against drug addiction has often overshadowed her recording success, is worth about 10 million pounds ($20 million). She did not attend the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in February, but still managed five big wins, including record and song of the year for her hit single "Rehab" and best pop vocal album for her breakthrough release, "Back to Black." Her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, 25, is due to stand trial in June charged with attempted obstruction of justice and inflicting grievous bodily harm. Fielder-Civil, who is in custody, denies the charges, which involved an East London pub brawl in June 2006
