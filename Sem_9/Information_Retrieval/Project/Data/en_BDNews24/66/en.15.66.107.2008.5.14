<TITLE> Myanmar aid trickles in, new cyclone fear discounted </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 1.5 million people left destitute by Myanmar's devastating cyclone were increasingly desperate on Wednesday, as foreign aid remained at a trickle and overstretched aid workers struggled to reach hard-hit areas. Reports a tropical depression was swirling southwest of Yangon and that it could develop into a major storm sparked concerns that a new tragedy could follow the early May cyclone that left up to 100,000 people dead or missing in the Irrawaddy delta. "It's terrible. This is always another worry when you have a major disaster, that you have further hazards affecting people," Amanda Pitt, spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian affairs office, told a news conference in Bangkok. However, A.R. Subbiah, director for the climate risk management team at the U.N.'s Bangkok-based Asia Disaster Preparedness Center, told Reuters later: "It is part of the monsoon system... Nothing to worry... It is very unlikely to develop into some kind of Nargis." In a gesture to critics who say outside aid is critical, Myanmar's reclusive military rulers meanwhile invited 160 personnel from neighboring Bangladesh, China, India and Thailand to assist in delayed and sometimes chaotic relief efforts. But that is a fraction of the thousands of foreign aid workers needed for a "tsunami-style" international aid operation. "It's just awful. People are in just desperate need, begging as vehicles go past," Gordon Bacon, an emergency coordinator for the International Rescue Committee, told Reuters from Yangon. Thailand's prime minister flew to Myanmar's main city of Yangon on Wednesday to try to persuade Prime Minister Thein Sein to let more foreign experts into the pulverized areas. Samak Sundaravej is hoping for more luck than United Nations and Western officials, whose efforts have had little success. AID DIVERTED? Some have suggested food and other urgent supplies may have been diverted by Myanmar's ruling junta rather than going straight to helpless victims, many homeless and some barefoot. But Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Mark Canning, told U.S.-based news network CNN: "We are pretty confident that what we brought in is going where it's needed." In any case, experts said the relief effort is only delivering a tenth of the supplies needed. The international community has flown in tonnes of medicine, food and shelter materials, but getting it to the low-lying delta area has been complicated by poor equipment, bad weather and government intransigence. Heavy rains have pelted the region, slowing transportation of aid by land and adding to the misery of tens of thousands of refugees packed into monasteries, schools and pagodas. Lacking food, water and sanitation, survivors of Cyclone Nargis face the threat of killer diseases such as cholera and in some areas are waiting in vain for help to arrive. "We have been told by Burmese doctors they have lots of patients with severely infected wounds and they are being hit by outbreaks of communicable diseases like diarrhea," senior Thai health official Doctor Surachet Satitniramai said. He told Reuters Thailand would send a medical team of 30 on Friday and Saturday with another 10 tonnes of supplies and equipment to work for two weeks. The team, including surgeons, anesthetists and psychiatrists, would be sent to work in affected areas. The WFP said it was looking for helicopters to airlift rice and high-energy biscuits to the Irrawaddy delta and also boats to reach isolated communities. It said it had provided food to 50,000 people and aimed to reach 750,000 over the next six months. Still, operations in Myanmar are a shadow of the massive international relief operation kick started just days after the 2004 Asian tsunami. The United States alone deployed thousands of its military and more than a dozen ships in the Indian Ocean. Many other countries provided major help. So far the U.S. military has made a total of eight flights into Yangon, carrying 197,080 pounds worth of aid including water and food. "We don't have confirmation of future flights yet but we are very optimistic," said Colonel Douglas Powell, a spokesman for what the military is calling Joint Taskforce "Caring Response". Three U.S. naval ships were in international waters off Myanmar waiting for the go-ahead from Myanmar's generals. "We just hope that the Burmese government will ask us to do more because we have so much more capability," Powell said.
