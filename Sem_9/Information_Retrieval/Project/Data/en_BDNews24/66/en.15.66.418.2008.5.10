<TITLE> England's Flintoff out of first two NZ tests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Andrew Flintoff has been ruled out of England's first two tests against New Zealand after picking up a side strain playing for Lancashire, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Saturday. The former captain had been hoping for a recall after a 14-month test absence despite playing only a few county games after surgery for a persistent ankle problem. However, his latest injury makes the decision easy for the selectors, who will name their team on Sunday for the first of three tests, starting on May 15 at Lord's. "Andrew has been ruled unavailable for selection for the opening two Test matches and will be reassessed during the course of the Test series whilst receiving ongoing treatment," the ECB said in a statement. "This is a relatively common injury for fast bowlers but is in no way related to the left ankle injury Andrew has suffered from in recent times. "Since returning to cricket with Lancashire this year Andrew has not experienced any discomfort in his left ankle and continues to make excellent progress in his rehabilitation from surgery last October." BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED Flintoff has been bowling well for Lancashire in their early-season games but has barely managed to register a score with the bat. Nevertheless, he was expected to be included in the side for the return series against New Zealand, who England beat 2-1 away from home earlier this year. "Obviously, I'm bitterly disappointed to be unavailable for selection due to this injury as I'm really enjoying my cricket with Lancashire and feel my bowling has been improving with each match," Flintoff said. "I've put in a lot of hard work to get to this point after ankle surgery last year and I know I can overcome what isn't a significant injury. "It's very frustrating to have picked up an injury at this time but I want nothing more than to return to the England side and will continue to do everything required to make myself available for selection." The 30-year-old, whose last test appearance came in the 2006-2007 Ashes series defeat in Australia, will now hope to return for the third test at Trent Bridge, starting on June 5, but a more realistic target would probably be the four-test series against South Africa which begins on July 10
