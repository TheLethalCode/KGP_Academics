<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government is set to form a local government commission in a bid to shore up the local justice system, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Sunday. "We are going to establish soon a local government commission in pursuance of the popular demand of wide range of stakeholders including local government representatives, academia and the development partners," the adviser said at a two-day workshop on "strengthening local justice system". The local justice system is aimed at bringing justice to the doorstep of societyfar from a complex, long-drawn legal system. The adviser said the commission ordinance was awaiting the president's approval. "After publishing the ordinance in the gazette form, we will constitute a three-member commission for the purpose," the adviser said. Iqbal said: "Through the formation of the commission, the government will be able to improve the prevailing democratic systems." "The grass-roots people will be able to access justice if their leadership is established through this commission. The village courts and arbitration council will see qualitative changes." The Union Parishad plays an important role in two institutions: Gram Adalat established under the Gram Adalat Act 2006 and the Arbitration Council established under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961. Dr Kamal Hossain, chairman of Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, said: "The grassroots poor have historically been deprived of justice and fair play all along." Dr Kamal said the present government was different from the past governments. "We hope the present administration will bring a qualitative change to the local judicial system," he said. World Bank country director Xian Zhu and BLAST executive director Taslimur Rahman also spoke at the programme, co-organised by the BLAST and the World Bank. bdnews24.com
