<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Thursday Bangladesh might provide aircraft for UN peacekeeping operations in Darfur, besides contributing two battalions of soldiers. The US urged Bangladesh to provide aircraft for the troubled region of Darfur in Sudan. US ambassador James F Moriarty made the request when he met with Iftekhar at the foreign ministry. "I have told him (the ambassador) that we must provide aircraft if we have that capability," Iftekhar told reporters after his meeting with Moriarty. "We have already offered two battalions of soldiers." Dhaka told Washington that it would request Myanmar to accept humanitarian aid pledged by the international community to help the cyclone-affected people of the Southeast Asian country. The ambassador urged Bangladesh to convince Myanmar to accept international aid. "We have very good relations with Myanmar. We will certainly use our good office over Myanmar to accept the aid pledged by the international community," the adviser said. Military rulers in Myanmar have been refusing to accept aid from the international community in the wake of the May 3 cyclone. Bangladesh also said to the US that it was thinking of recognising Kosovo which declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. Islamic countries could take a concerted decision on recognising Kosovo at the July meeting of foreign ministers of the Islamic countries in Uganda. The US and the European Union have recognised Kosovo although Russia and Serbia have strongly opposed Kosovo's independence. Russia had warned that it might use its veto power against Kosovo's inclusion in the UN. "We have sought Bangladesh's support for a number of issues. For example, diplomatic recognition of Kosovo," Moriarty told bdnews24.com. The ambassador termed chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's address to the nation "positive" and hoped the election process would go on and political parties would take part in the upcoming polls. bdn
