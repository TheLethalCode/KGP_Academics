 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England manager Fabio Capello named a 30-man squad on Sunday for the friendlies against the United States and Trinidad & Tobago later this month. Nine players from Champions League finalists Manchester United and Chelsea were selected, including Chelsea skipper John Terry who dislocated his elbow in his side's 1-1 draw with Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. Former first choice keeper Paul Robinson was omitted but LA Galaxy's David Beckham, who won his 100th cap against France in March, was included. Several uncapped players could get their chance to impress Capello. Everton's Phil Jagielka and Blackburn Rovers' Stephen Warnock are both in the squad as is Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Tom Huddlestone and West Ham United striker Dean Ashton. England play the U.S. at Wembley on May 28 before travelling to play Trinidad & Tobago on June 1. Squad: Goalkeepers: Joe Hart (Manchester City), David James (Portsmouth), Chris Kirkland (Wigan); Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Chelsea), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), David Wheater (Middlesbrough), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), Glen Johnson (Portsmouth), John Terry (Chelsea), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Jonathan Woodgate (Tottenham Hotspur), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Stephen Warnock (Blackburn Rovers); Midfielders: Gareth Barry (Aston Villa), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), David Beckham (LA Galaxy), Jermaine Jenas (Tottenham Hotspur), Owen Hargreaves (Manchester United), Joe Cole (Chelsea), David Bentley (Blackburn), Tom Huddlestone (Tottenham Hotspur), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough); Forwards: Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Ashley Young (Aston Villa), Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa), Michael Owen (Newcastle United), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Jermain Defoe (Portsmouth), Dean Ashton (West Ham United)
