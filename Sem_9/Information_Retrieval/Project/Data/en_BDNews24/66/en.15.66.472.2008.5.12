<TITLE> Giggs etches name deeper into United history </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WIGAN, England, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ryan Giggs etched his name even deeper into the history of Manchester United as he struck the goal which confirmed the Old Trafford club's 10th English Premier League title in the space of 15 years. His introduction as a second-half substitute at Wigan on Sunday saw the 34-year-old equal United's appearance record of 758 games held by Bobby Charlton who watched the game from the directors box. And 12 minutes later Giggs, who made his league debut for United in March, 1991, scored the goal which finally killed off the challenge of both Wigan and title rivals Chelsea as United sealed a 2-0 win which allowed them to retain the championship by a two-point margin. Giggs, who has played a part in all 10 of the titles masterminded by manager Alex Ferguson and has 17 major winners' medals in his collection, has been an outstanding servant for United since coming through the club's youth system. He has been used sparingly in recent weeks by Ferguson and has managed just four goals this season, but remains an enduring talent which was employed to perfection on a desperately tense afternoon. LOOKED VULNERABLE With Chelsea in the lead against Bolton, United's 1-0 advantage, given to them by Cristiano Ronaldo from the penalty spot after 33 minutes, looked vulnerable in the face of a bold effort from Wigan. But Giggs brought a calmness to United's midfield and then scored the vital second goal when he accepted a pass from Wayne Rooney, took his time and then with his famous left foot rolled the ball into the bottom corner of the net. "Their goalkeeper made two or three saves and you say to yourself 'hopefully we'll get that second goal'," said Ferguson afterwards. "And the oldest player, Ryan Giggs with 10 medals, gets it. "It was fantastic that he got it. Whether it was fate, it could be. But he deserved it. He's a credit to the game. I have known him for 20 years and for him to equal the record on the day he scored the goal that wins the title for us is fantastic." Giggs, as modest as ever, preferred to concentrate on the team prize rather than his own individual milestone after United had received the league trophy and their individual medals in front of their celebrating supporters at the JJB Stadium. "That does not come into it. Championships are what it's about," he said. "We knew it would be a tough game, and it was. We did well in the first half and got that first goal. Then it was a case of holding on." Defender Rio Ferdinand paid tribute to Giggs. "That's his 10th title and he keeps driving on. He's an inspiration to all the lads," Ferdinand said. Wigan manager Steve Bruce, a former team mate of the Welsh winger at Old Trafford, said Giggs had produced an apt ending to United's title campaign. "I was fortunate to play on his debut, when he scored. He has equalled the record and he is just a great, great player. He epitomises what Manchester United are about," said Bruce
