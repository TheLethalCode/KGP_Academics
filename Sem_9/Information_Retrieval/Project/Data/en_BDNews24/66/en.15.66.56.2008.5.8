 Dhaka, May 08 (bdnews24.com)--The European Union (EU) ambassadors in Dhaka have said that the next general elections can still be free, fair and credible even if boycotted by the Awami League and the BNP. They said the next parliamentary polls were essential for sustainable democracy in Bangladesh. One of the ambassadors said individuals could not be a decisive factor for a democratic system, meaning elections must be held with or without former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. "An election can (still) be free and fair and credible even if one or two parties boycott it. This is certainly not ideal. (But) this is not an element which is sine qua non (a condition) for a free and fair election," head of the delegation of the European Commission in Dhaka Stefan Frowein said at a press conference, organised on occasion of the first European Day. He was asked whether a credible election would be possible if the BNP and the Awami League boycotted it. Ambassadors or honorary Consuls of 19 EU member countries attended the press conference at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel in the afternoon. Frowein talked on behalf of the EC. Some of the ambassadors supplemented his answers to questions from reporters on Bangladesh's political and economic situation. Referring to examples of his country, German ambassador Frank Meyke said, "Individuals cannot be a decisive factor for a democratic system." He was asked whether elections would be held if former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina were barred from the foray. Meyke hoped the BNP and the Awmai League would take part in the upcoming elections. "The EU is convinced that elections in 2008 are essential for securing a sustainable democracy in Bangladesh and securing progress towards the goal of achieving the status of a middle income country," Frowein said in the written statement. He said nobody liked the state of emergency. "The EU supports the lifting of the state of emergency as soon as the situation allows," said the EU delegation head. French ambassador Charley Causeret said he was frustrated as the political parties were only talking about the release of their leaders and lifting of the state of emergency. Dutch ambassador BM (Bea) Ten Tusscher said: "We remain concerned about the human rights situation in Bangladesh. We have told it to the government." "We want concrete answers from the government on the human rights abuses by some forces." Italian ambassador Itala Occhi, Danish ambassador Einar Hobegaard and Swedish ambassador Britt Falkman Hagstrom were also present at the press conference. bdn
