 BUJUMBURA, May 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burundi's army said on Thursday it had killed 50 fighters from the country's last active guerrilla group in clashes outside the capital Bujumbura. "The Forces for National Liberation (FNL) ambushed our troops on patrol, the army then entered into heavy battle with the insurgents ... two soldiers were also killed," army spokesman Colonel Adolphe Manirakiza said. The FNL could not immediately be reached for comment. The Wednesday night battle in the FNL stronghold of Kabezi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Bujumbura, brings the death toll since renewed violence broke out in April to 103.
