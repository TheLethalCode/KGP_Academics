 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Board of Investment and officials of Tata Group are likely to discuss an investment proposal by the Indian business giant Sunday, a senior official said. "A meeting with Tata officials is scheduled for Sunday," BoI executive chairman Md Kamaluddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Friday. A senior official of the energy ministry, asking not to be named, said officials of the Energy Division would also be present at the meeting. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman on April 29 told reporters that Tata was still hopeful of investment in Bangladesh. After a meeting with Tata Group's Bangladesh representative Manjer Hossain, the adviser said Tata wanted to have talks with Bangladesh government. Tata signed a memorandum of understanding with Bangladesh in 2004 on a $2 billion investment. Later the proposal was hiked to $3 billion. Tata's investment proposal includes a 1,000 megawatt gas-fired power plant and a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant. Also on the cards was a fertiliser plant with a one million-tonne a year capacity and a 2.4 million-tonne steel mill in Ishwardi. Dhaka had earlier rejected Tata's initial 2004 offer to buy gas at a fixed rate of $1.10 per unit over a 20-year period from the government. Later, in April 2006, Tata came up with a new proposal that offered to pay $3.10 per thousand cubic feet (TCF) of gas for its fertiliser plant. The revised deal also included a proposal to pay $2.60 per TCF for the steel plant's power supply. However, the plan remained pegged to a 20-year guarantee to supply natural gas to the projects. Tata in July 2006 suspended work on investment because of dithering by the government. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Oct 03 last year said the caretaker administration was not in a position to approve or reject the Tata proposal. bdnews
