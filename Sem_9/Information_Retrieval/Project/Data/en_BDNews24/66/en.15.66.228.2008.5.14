 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  Five caretaker advisers Wednesday finalised the Chief Adviser's Office as the venue for dialogue set to start on May 22 with political parties. After a meeting at LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal's office, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters that the advisers had talks on preparation for dialogue in line with an announcement of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his address to the nation. The advisers discussed a schedule for dialogue. The schedule will be finalised in a couple of days and the matter will then be discussed with civil society members, the adviser said. Zillur said the government had already invited 20 political parties. The Election Commission's list of political parties and those who took part in pre-dialogue talks helped the government to select parties to invite, he said. A list of civil society members will be prepared in discussion with the chief adviser. The government asked political parties to send up to seven representatives to dialogue, the commerce adviser said. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury were also present at the meeting. bdnew
