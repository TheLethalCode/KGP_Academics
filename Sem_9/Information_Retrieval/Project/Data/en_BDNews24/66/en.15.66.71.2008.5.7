 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has sought explanations from three mobile phone operators on why they sold a large number of subscription forms, filled in with personal details of subscribers, to shops, the telecoms regulator said Wednesday. The move came after the BTRC seized the 13kg of forms from different shops in the city. The mobile phone operators are legally obliged to preserve the forms and keep subscriber details confidential, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com. He expressed worry at the discovery of the filled-in forms in shops as privacy of mobile phone subscribers might be at risk. The three companies such as Grameenphone, Banglalink and Aktel have been asked to explain the matter. "Action will be taken against them if explanations are not satisfactory," Alam said. "It's unfortunate," he said adding: "The mobile phone operators were asked to be careful in future." A BTRC official preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com that the mobile operators had been shown the documents BTRC retrieved from the markets. The BTRC chairman held a meeting with the CEOs of six mobile operators on Monday. A subscriber has to fill in three subscription forms to buy a SIM card. Of the three, one is returned to the customer while two others are preserved by the phone company. Syed Yamin Bakht, director (public relations) of Grameenphone, said that it had been brought to their notice. "Some subscriber forms were discarded by third party dealers. It is a serious issue, and we are investigating it," Yamin Bakht said. Aktel director (coordination) Fazlur Rahman said that the forms BTRC had retrieved were old and blank. Only one of them was complete with personal details of a subscriber, he added, refusing to elaborate. The head of a mobile phone operator, present at the BTRC meeting Monday, said he had been shown the forms retrieved. The top official claimed that none of the forms belonged to his company, but he ordered an enquiry to find whether his company was involved in any such incident. bdnews
