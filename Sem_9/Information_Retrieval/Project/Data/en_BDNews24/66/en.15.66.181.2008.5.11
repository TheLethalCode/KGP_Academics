<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Usha Krira Chakra Sunday crossed a tough hurdle in the Premier Division Hockey League when they handed a 6-4 defeat to Sonali Bank SRC in the tense encounter at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. With the fifth straight win, Usha KC topped the 10-team point table with 15 points, three points ahead of Abahani Limited, who however, played one match short of the league leaders. It was the first defeat in five matches for Sonali Bank, who stunned Usha 2-1 to qualify for the final of the season's curtain raiser Club Cup Hockey. Sonali secured 10 points to stay with Mohammedan SC in the third position. Usha from the very first dominated over the bankers and went three goals ahead in 13 minutes before the bankers pulled one goal back in the first half. Maksudul Alam Habul, Jahidul Islam Rajan and Mostafizur Rahman Dinar scored in the second, eighth and 13th minutes respectively to give Usha a 3-0 lead before promising striker Rimon Kumar reimbursed a goal for Sonali in the 23rd minute. After the breather, Sonali Bank reorganised to press hard on last year's joint champions Usha and got the dividend 11 minutes into the second half with Sheikh Mohammad Nannu and Asaduzzaman Chandan scoring one goal each in the 41st and the 46th minutes to level the margin 3-3. But the bankers failed to keep the momentum with Usha forwards tearing the opponents' backline and scored another three goals in a row within five minutes to ensure their all-win record in the league. Pakistani midfielder Tareq Aziz made it 4-3 in the 55th minute before Habul and Rajon scored their day's second goal in the 57th and 60th minutes to shrug off Sonali pressure. Sonali Bank, however, saw defender Enamul Kabir Turjo convert a penalty corner to reduce the margin to 6-4 five minutes from time.
