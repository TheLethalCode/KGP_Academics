<TITLE> Voting begins in Serbian election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Belgrade, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbs began voting on Sunday in an election that will show whether the lure of European Union membership outweighs their anger over the Western-backed secession of Kosovo. Serbia is divided and the two front-runners, the nationalist Radical Party and the pro-Western Democratic Party, will have to woo smaller parties to form a coalition. The West has made clear it hopes the Democrats will win. Some 6.7 million people are registered to vote, including the defiant Serb minority in Kosovo, Serbia's former province which declared independence in February. Polls close at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT).
