<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnew24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday there was no alternative to increasing fuel prices as oil price soared to an all-time high on the international market. But he wants to maintain caution so that low-income people and the agriculture sector do not suffer, he said. "Fuel prices will surely be increased. We have no alternative," he told reporters at Zia International Airport on his return from abroad. "The import cost has increased manifold. Maintaining balance of payment has turned out to be difficult. Things can not go this way. It is inevitable that we have no way except increasing the price of oil," the adviser said. He, however, said any final decision would come after consultation with the top brass of the interim administration. In the next budget, the adviser said, the amount of subsidy on fuel for irrigation would be increased. Azizul returned Saturday after attending a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok and the Asian Development Bank board meeting in Madrid. Oil jumped to a record above $126 a barrel Friday on the international market, extending gains to more than 11 percent since the start of the month on fuel supply concerns and a rush of speculator buying. US crude settled up $2.27 at $125.96 a barrel before rising to a record $126.25 in late post-settlement trade. London Brent crude gained $2.56 to settle at $125.40 a barrel, off the earlier high of $125.90. Oil cost up to $62 a barrel in April last year. "Such an abnormal rise in oil prices piled huge pressure on the national economy," the adviser said. Sketching the upcoming budget, the adviser said: "The rate of tax will in no way be increased in the next budget. In some cases the rate of tax may decrease, but the tax net will widen." He said the government was thinking of expanding the social safety net emphasising elderly allowance, allowance for freedom fighters, widows and destitute people. "More people will be brought under the social safety umbrella," Mirza Aziz said. The Manila-headquartered ADB has set up a $34 million fund to assist the countries affected by climate change. Bangladesh could be a potential beneficiary, the adviser said. "The matter would be negotiated with the ADB later." During the visit, the adviser had bilateral meetings with the ADB president, finance ministers of Japan and the UK, a high-level delegation of the European Union and SAARC ministers. The adviser left Dhaka on April 27. bdnews24.com
