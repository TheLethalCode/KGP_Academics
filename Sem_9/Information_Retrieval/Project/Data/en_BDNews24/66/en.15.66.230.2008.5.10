 LONDON, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this Sunday's final round of fixtures: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is hopeful Nemanja Vidic will be fit to return for their crucial match at Wigan Athletic where victory will guarantee them the title. The Serbia centre-back suffered a facial injury in the 2-1 defeat at Chelsea a fortnight ago. Forward Wayne Rooney remains a doubt with a hip injury although he may be on the bench. United's Portugal midfielder Nani is suspended following his sending off against West Ham United last weekend. Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho is battling against a back injury but hopes to be fit for the home match against Bolton Wanderers that could see them crowned champions. "He didn't train today but we'll see tomorrowhe's better," manager Avram Grant told reporters. Grant also said Salomon Kalou had recovered from an ankle injury. Chelsea must better United's result at Wigan Athletic to win the title. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger could start with two English 18-year-olds in midfield against Sunderland. Kieran Gibbs, who was on the bench last week against Everton, could be joined by Mark Randall as Wenger looks to the future. "I could give one or two (first-choice) players an early breather because they go to Euro 2008 or the African (World Cup) qualifiers," Wenger told the Arsenal Web site (www.arsenal.com). Midfielder Aleksandr Hleb, who his agent said wants to leave the north London club, is suspended. Birmingham City expect to have Mehdi Nafti and Liam Ridgewell available to face visitors Blackburn Roversa match they must not lose to have any chance of staying up. Midfielder Nafti missed last weekend's defeat by fellow relegation battlers Fulham with a thigh strain. Defender Ridgewell picked up an ankle injury in that game. Fulham owner Mohamed Al Fayed said the club's fate is in God's hands as they prepare to face Portsmouth. A tremendous late rally means Fulham will stay up if they win at Fratton Park, having looked doomed a few weeks ago. "I am very hopeful about Sunday, the players are fired up but the result is in God's hands," he told the club's Web site (www.fulhamfc.com). Everton are desperate for the point they need to guarantee fifth place and a spot in next season's UEFA Cup and avoid having to play in the Intertoto Cup. They host Newcastle United knowing a defeat could allow Aston Villa to pip them for fifth spot. "Sunday's game means everything," midfielder Leon Osman said. "Not only to make sure we are automatically in the UEFA Cup, but we don't really want to be left in the Intertoto Cup," "We really enjoyed our European experience this season and not to have it next term would be a disaster for us." Relegated Derby County will be without defender Dean Leacock for their Premier League farewell against Reading. The 23-year-old is due to have a hernia operation. Derby, who have 11 points, will set a record for the lowest points total in the top flight even if they win. Reading, who will almost certainly be relegated should they lose, are likely to be without injured midfielder Glen Little
