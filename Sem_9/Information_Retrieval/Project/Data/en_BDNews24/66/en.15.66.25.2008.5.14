 SINGAPORE, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil was little changed below $126 on Wednesday, with traders awaiting an expected rebound in weekly US distillate stocks and still on edge over the previous day's report that Iran was considering a proposal to cut output. US light crude for June delivery was unchanged at $125.80 a barrel by 1:30 am EDT (0530 GMT). It surged to a seventh consecutive record high on Tuesday, hitting $126.98 a barrel before profit-taking pared the day's gains. London Brent crude was up 19 cents at $124.29. "The upward trend is still alive. The news about Iran is creating uncertainties and should keep crude oil prices buoyant," said Shuji Sugata, manager at Mitsubishi Corp Futures and Securities Ltd in Tokyo. Oil's surge on Tuesday came after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said a proposal for OPEC's second biggest producer to cut crude output was under review, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency said. But a senior Iranian Oil Ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday that Iran was exporting oil as usual and had no plans to cut crude exports. "There is no plan to cut exports and we keep our promises (to clients) ... and we export as usual," said Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, executive director of international affairs at the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Iran's production topped 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, nearly 5 percent of global supply and its highest since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The supply threat added to a global market already uneasy over supplies of distillates such as heating oil and diesel fuel. US heating oil futures settled on Tuesday at a record $3.6989 a gallon, driving the entire oil complex higher. "We have to watch the outcome of US oil inventory data to determine the near-term trend as both crude and oil products stocks are expected to rise," Sugata said. European middle distillate stocks fell sharply in April to 361.28 million barrels, down 1.4 percent from March and 7.2 percent lower than a year ago, data from industry monitor Euroilstock showed on Tuesday. Traders were awaiting the latest US weekly data for more direction, after an unexpected fall in distillates stocks last week left them at 105.7 million barrels, the lower half of the normal range for this time of the year. "Distillates are clearly driving the market and US distillate inventories will have to be watched this week. But large investment flows are also driving the market," said Marc Lansonneur, Societe Generale's head of commodities derivatives in Asia. Analysts expect distillates stocks to have risen by an average 800,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll. Gasoline stocks are seen unchanged and crude oil stocks could rise by 1.8 million barrels, their fourth increase in a row. The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its inventory report for the week to May 9 on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT)
