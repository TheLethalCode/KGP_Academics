 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com) The Bangladesh Hockey Federation tries to win the bid for hosting the 2009 8th Asia Cup as the Asian Hockey Federation wants to organise the Asian mega extravaganza in a low-ranked nation. "The meeting of the governing meeting Saturday gave us a signal of' go- ahead' to win the bid for hosting the 8th Asia Cup in 2009 as we have already applied to the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF) to host the meet," said BHF general secretary Sajed A.A. Adel Sunday. Adel said the AHF wants to organise the Asian Cup in a low-ranked country to inspire hockey among the least developed countries. The former national hockey player said, "They have already proposed to host the meet in between January and February, but the AHF asked Bangladesh to organise the meet in May. However, the final decision would be taken at the AHF councillors' meeting in Singapore during the Asia Cup qualifiers from July 14 to 22. The BHF general secretary said, apart from Bangladesh, Iran, Brunei and Macau have expressed their willingness to host the meet as six top teams of Asia have been discouraged to host the meet. Bangladesh will play the Asia Cup qualifying round from where top four teams will qualify for the 10-team Asia Cup. The meeting has appointed Mahbub Haroon chief coach of the national team for the qualifiers while Barkatullah Chapal will be his deputy. The meeting also decided to send Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) to participate in the 6th Men's Asia Cup (under-21) championship to be held from July 8 to 18 in Hyderabad in India this year. It also decided to include some five to six players outside BKSP in the 21-squad. The meeting also decided to send umpire Mahbubul Haq Mitu, who has been upgraded to national grade A in the meeting, to conduct the Asia Cup qualifiers in Singapore while Farid Ahmed Milu will be a judge in the meet.
