<TITLE> SC lawyers to boycott Appellate Division </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Supreme Court lawyers Sunday decided to boycott the Appellate Division for two hours Thursday in protest against a series of verdicts including the one that prevents courts from granting bail in EPR cases. The boycott will start at 9.00am, according to a decision taken by the Supreme Court Bar Association at a meeting. The SCBA also decided not to hold any ceremony to bid farewell to the outgoing chief justice or to welcome the new CJ. A resolution adopted at the SCBA meeting alleges that Appellate Division judges breached their oath by delivering verdicts on some old cases that had been brought under emergency rule later. The resolution also alleges that the Appellate Division handed down some verdicts in line with several provisions of emergency rule that run counter to the rule of law, fundamental rights of people and the constitution. Some verdicts by the Appellate Division "disappointed and surprised" the lawyers, the resolution claims. The Supreme Court lawyers also demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency and an immediate national polls schedule to establish democracy and a rule of law. The SCBA demanded that the misuse of all laws including emergency rule be stopped and cases meant to harass political leaders be withdrawn. SCBA president Barrister Shafiq Ahmed said: "Judges of the apex court take oath to uphold the constitution, but they did not keep it." Dubbing emergency rule as a black law, the SCBA president alleged that the politicians had been implicated in false cases to keep them behind bars. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq alleged that the Appellate Division had undermined the High Court Division and showed disrespect to the constitutional and fundamental rights of the people and the rule of law. Former SCBA president barrister Amir-ul Islam said the High Court Division should have the jurisdiction to grant bail under emergency rule. bdnew
