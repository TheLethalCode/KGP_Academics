 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP will submit memoranda to upazila nirbahi officers and deputy commissioners, starting Sunday, to press its demand for the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and other 'political prisoners', Khandaker Delwar Hossain said. Delwar, secretary general of a faction of the troubled party, announced a 10-point charter of demands and weeklong programmes in a press briefing on his NAM flat Thursday. The BNP demanded that the government's draft gazette on the redrawing of parliament constituencies be scrapped. Leaders and workers of the party's upazila and district units will submit memoranda to upazila nirbahi officers and deputy commissioners from Sunday to Thursday and will arrange prayers Friday. Delwar demanded withdrawal of the cases against all "political prisoners", freedom for the prisoners and an end to the state of emergency. The BNP also announced programmes for May 30 to mark the death anniversary of president Ziaur Rahman. The programmes include keeping the party flag at half-staff, placing wreaths at Zia's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar and holding discussion meetings. The BNP and its front organisations will start distribution of foods among destitute people from June 2 for one week. Delwar also asked for the withdrawal of the chargesheet in the Sabbir murder case involving BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman. "As a lawyer, the chargesheet seems to me a false story. It is false and politically-motivated. The case was designed to taint the image of Tarique Rahman," Delwar said. BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman, acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were also present at the press briefing. bdnew
