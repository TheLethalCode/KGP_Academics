 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Wednesday approved in principle the Upazila Parishad Ordinance 2008 with a provision for direct vote to elect two vice-chairmen for an upazila, a government spokesman said. According to the proposed ordinance, one of the two vice-chairmen must be a woman, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters. "The proposed ordinance prescribes a chairman and two vice-chairmen for an upazilaall to be elected by direct vote," he told reporters after a cabinet meeting, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office. According to a new provision in the ordinance, any case challenging the results of Upazila Parishad elections must be filed in 30 days from the publication of a gazette on results. The case must be disposed of in 180 days from its filing and an appeal against the verdict must be submitted in 30 days and the verdict on the appeal must be delivered in 120 days, according to the ordinance. The proposed ordinance said political leaders could contest the polls but the elected people must give up their political posts before taking oath. Before the election, the candidates have to submit an affidavit to prove that he is not unfit for the polls. There is a provision in the ordinance for penalty for a delay in power transfer to an elected representative. The punishment may run up to three years in jail and Tk 20,000 in fine. The people running for vice-chairman will be ineligible to contest the polls if they are accused of defaulting on loans in the last one year before elections. The caretaker government in January passed the authority of announcing Upazila Parishad election schedule to the Election Commission amending the act. In a bid to strengthen the local government body, a committee led by food and disaster management adviser AMM Shawkat Ali formulated the local government ordinance with a recommendation to abolish the provision that allowed a local lawmaker to be in the Upazila Parishad as adviser. In another decision Wednesday, the cabinet gave final approval to an amendment to the National Board of Revenue Order 1972. Munaim said the amended ordinance would now enable the government to appoint a secretary or additional secretary to the NBR as chairman. According to the existing law, the government has to appoint an NBR member as chairman. But the government had never followed the provision, which created a controversy and kicked up court battles. bdnews24.c
