 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh women's cricket team Thursday conceded 38-run defeat to their Pakistani counterparts in their fifth match in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh were surprisingly all out for 72 in 33.1 overs after bundling Pakistan out for a paltry 110 in 44.4 overs at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. Bangladesh beat Pakistan by four wickets in the first leg. Shathira Jakir and Ayesha Akhter gave Bangladesh a fine start after opener Shukhtara fell on 2, but they failed to keep the momentum in the face of tight bowling from Javeria Khan and captain Urooj Mumtaz. Shathira (19) and Ayesha (12) put on 29 runs for the second wicket, but both were dismissed by Mumtaz and Bangladesh slipped to 55 for eight in the face of superb bowling from Javeria, who finally returned six for eight in his 8.1 overs. Shamima Akhter played a 27-ball 11, but didn't salvage Bangladesh from their fifth defeat in six matches. Opting to bat first, Pakistan fell in trouble to be reduced to 39 for five in 17.1 overs before middle order batswomen Sajjida Shah (18), Jeveria (18), Asmavia Iqbal (28) and Batool Fatima (13) took their side beyond 100-mark. Panna Ghosh and Tithy Sarkar grabbed three wickets each for 18 and 29 respectively while Salma Khatun took two for eight. Bangladesh will play their sixth and last match against Sri Lanka Friday.
