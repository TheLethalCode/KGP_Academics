 BAGHDAD Thu May 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clashes between Shia militiamen and security forces in Baghdad's Sadr City slum killed seven people and wounded 19 overnight, Iraqi police and hospitals said on Thursday. The dead were all men and the wounded included three women and three children, they said. The US military says fighting in the stronghold of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has eased since Saturday when Sadr's opposition movement in parliament reached an agreement with the ruling Shi'ite alliance to end the violence there.

The US military says the violence is being carried out by rogue elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, which it says are armed, trained and funded by Iran. Tehran denies the charges.
