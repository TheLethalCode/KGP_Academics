 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City manager Sven-Goran Eriksson suffered a humiliating end to his first season in English club management when his side were thrashed 8-1 at Middlesbrough on Sunday. The Swede's future at the club was already under threat despite steering them to a respectable ninth place and City's capitulation would not have pleased the club's Thai owner Thaksin Shinawatra, who is thought to be unhappy with results in the second half of the campaign. Former England manager Eriksson said the situation needed to resolved quickly. "The problem is that we have to speak clearly face to face and see what the club wants to do," Eriksson told Sky Sports. "Living in uncertainty is not good for anyone. I hope that there will be some sort of meeting. "There should be now that the league is finished. It's important for the club for next season." Eriksson's side were also on the receiving end of a 6-0 drubbing at Chelsea in October and collapsed again after Richard Dunne was sent off in the first half. "It is difficult to take whenever you lose. But, when you lose like this, it is awful," Eriksson said. "We were not even on the pitchthe team had totally gone and it was embarrassing for everyone." City are expected to play in the UEFA Cup next year after the Premier League was handed an extra spot through UEFA's Fair Play table
