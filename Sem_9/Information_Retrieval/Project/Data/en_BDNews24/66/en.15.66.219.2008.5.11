 Baghdad, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A deal to stop fighting between gunmen and security forces in the Baghdad stronghold of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr appeared to be holding on Sunday. Residents in Sadr City said there were no reports of fighting overnight after Shi'ite political factions reached an agreement on Saturday to end seven weeks of clashes that have killed hundreds of people in the Shi'ite Muslim slum. The fighting between U.S.-backed security forces and gunmen had trapped the 2 million residents of Sadr City in a battle zone and prompted aid workers to warn of a humanitarian crisis. But deals to end fighting between gunmen loyal to the anti-U.S. cleric and security forces have collapsed in the past. It is also unclear how much control Sadr has over many of the Mehdi Army militiamen who claim allegiance to him. Despite the calm, officials at the two Sadr City hospitals said they had received one body and treated 5 wounded people overnight. Before the agreement was struck on Saturday, the two hospitals said 19 people had been killed and 116 wounded in the previous 24 hours. The government has welcomed the agreement, struck between the Sadr movement's bloc in parliament and the ruling Shi'ite alliance. It should allow food, medicine and other essential supplies to be trucked in to the eastern Baghdad district. The U.S. military, in its first comment on the pact, said it welcomed any effort to bring an end to violence in Sadr City. "As we have always indicated, we support political solutions in Sadr City as well as all of Iraq," said Colonel Jerry O'Hara, a military spokesman in Baghdad. "We would welcome an end to violence by criminal elements who continue to endanger the lives of innocent Iraqi citizens." The government has said the agreement called for militiamen to hand in their medium and heavy weapons. This would include rocket and mortar launchers, which have been used to fire hundreds of shells at the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound since Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered a crackdown on militias in late March. Gunmen have been battling U.S. and Iraqi forces nearly every night in Sadr City since the crackdown, making life a misery for the slum's largely poor inhabitants. Several thousand people have fled but most have been holed up in their homes. Sadr threatened last month to formally scrap a truce he imposed on the Mehdi Army in August unless the government halted its crackdown. A few weeks later he told the militia to observe the truce -- which has at times seemed irrelevant -- leaving Iraqis guessing over his true intentions. The cleric originally declared the truce in August to weed out rogue elements of the militia. A Sadr spokesman said he expected the cleric to make a statement about the pact.
