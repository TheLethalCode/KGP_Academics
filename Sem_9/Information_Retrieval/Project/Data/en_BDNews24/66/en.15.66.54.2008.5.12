<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  Professor Muzaffer Ahmad, chairman of the trustee board of Transparency International Bangladesh, said Monday chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed explained "everything" political parties wanted to know. "The chief adviser announced a date and some possible agenda of dialogue. The matter of understanding was in the speech," he said. Muzaffer said the CA did not clarify if talks would be held together with Jamaat-e-Islami. He said the CA's speech was supplementary to the roadmap laid out by the Election Commission. "It cleared the government's position. It is a good thing," he said. Professor Anwar Hossain, general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers Association, told bdnews24.com that the speech disappointed the nation. "The nation expected a specific announcement on the withdrawal of the state of emergency," he said. Prof Hossain said a democratic election highly required a congenial atmosphere. "Such atmosphere does not exist under a state of emergency. People are not able to express their views due to the emergency. It is not possible to hold a peaceful election with people confined indoors. Former DUTA president AAMS Arefin Siddique expressed disappointment at the CA's speech. "Withdrawal of the state of emergency is a prerequisite for dialogue to begin. But the chief adviser did not say anything about it, which disappointed the nation." He said holding elections with the state of emergency in force would be a farce. bdnews24.c
