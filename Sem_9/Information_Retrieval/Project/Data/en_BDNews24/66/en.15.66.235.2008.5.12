 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Abahani Limited came from behind to beat Ajax SC 3-1 in the Premier Division Hockey League at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Monday. With the fifth straight triumph, Abahani joined league leaders Usha Krira Chakra with 15 points from five matches. Mohammedan Sporting Club recorded their fourth victory with an emphatic 6-0 win over Shadharan Bima KS to raise their point tally to 13 from five outings. With the first appearance of two new Pakistani recruits, Abahani seemed disorganised in the first half, and Ajax taking that advantage went ahead in the 22nd minute with Rahat Sarwar scoring a field goal. Pakistani striker Mohammad Modasser, however, levelled the margin for Abahani in the 29th minute. After the breather, Rasel Mahmud Jimmy and Mamunur Rahman Chayan scored one goal each in the 54th and 68th minute to ensure Abahani's fifth win. In other match of the day, Mohammedan dominated minnows Shadharan Bima throughout the game and took a comfortable 3-0 lead in the first half with Jahid Bin Talib Shuvo striking twice and Tapash Barman netting once. After the lemon break, Ariful Haq Prince, Syed Al Masum and Abdus Sajjad John scored one goal each to bring Mohammedan back to the winning track after a 2-2 draw against Sonali Bank in their previous game.
