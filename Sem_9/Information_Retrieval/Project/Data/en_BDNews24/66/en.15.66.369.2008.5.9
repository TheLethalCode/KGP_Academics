 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)--Washington will not accept any military takeover in Bangladesh, said US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs Richard A Boucher Friday. Updated The US official categorically said Bangladesh must restore democracy. A good election will not be possible under the state of emergency, Boucher told reporters at a press conference at the American Club in the city Boucher said he would have talks with political parties to ensure their participation in the upcoming general election. To a question on any military takeover, he said: "The answer is the same as beforeno. The only path forward for Bangladesh is to restore democracy and have an election." "That is the only path anybody talked to me about during the course of the visit including the army chief." "We would not accept any deviation from that path and we will work with everybody here to make sure Bangladesh that can achieve that," he said. The US stand against any military takeover follows British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury's comment against any army takeover. Choudhury had recently said Britain would never support any military intervention or military regime in Bangladesh. Boucher came to Bangladesh Thursday on a two-day visit. Boucher met with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, army chief Moeen U Ahmed, foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain and a number of other government officials. "We don't think there would a good election under emergency. We think the emergency has to be lifted. We think the rules for political activity need to be opened up," said Boucher. "We have been encouraging the lifting of the emergency. And we think this necessary in order to have a good election." He also underlined the need for participation of all political parties in the upcoming elections. "We hope that there will be an election, there must be an election. And we think everybody needs to participate in it. "I said they (political parties) need to reach an agreement between each other on how to conduct that election," Boucher said. "I do want to hear from the political parties about how they see the situation. I can hear from them about how they can participate and what the key elements they see as necessary for participation are," he added. On possible 'terrorist attacks', he said, "I suppose there is always a possibility that terrorists will try to disrupt the electionsThere is always the possibility of the groups, (JMB) and others active, and you will have to be vigilant. "You will have to have good counter-terrorism programme in order to make sure that this type of thing does not happen." He told bdews24.com that there was no specific or urgent terrorist threat in Bangladesh. bdnews
