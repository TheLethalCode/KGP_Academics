 LONDON, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Porto defender Jose Bosingwa has agreed a three-year deal with Chelsea and will join the Premier League runners-up after Euro 2008, the London club said on Monday. "Jose Bosingwa has agreed terms with Chelsea Football Club. He has agreed a three-year contract," said a statement on the club's Web site (www.chelseafc.com). "I always had a dream to play in England and Chelsea is a club where I can prove myself and improve as a player," he said in an interview with Chelsea TV. Porto said on their Web site (fcporto.pt) on Sunday that Chelsea would pay 20.5 million Euros ($31.75 million) for the 25-year-old Kinshasa-born Portugal international, regarded as one of the best right backs in Europe. Premier League runners-up Chelsea have struggled at right back this season with Paulo Ferreira out of favour and Juliano Belletti making little impact since signing from Barcelona. Manager Avram Grant has even used midfielder Michael Essien out of position on the right side of defence. Bosingwa joined Porto from Boavista in 2003 and is a former team mate of Chelsea defenders Ricardo Carvalho and Ferreira and also played at Porto under former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho
