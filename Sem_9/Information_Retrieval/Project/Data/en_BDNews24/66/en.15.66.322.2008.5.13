 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)Supreme Court lawyers split into opposing camps Tuesday over the planned boycott of the Appellate Division. A group of lawyers led by Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, former vice chairman of Bangladesh Bar Council, have taken an opposing line against the Supreme Court Bar Association's call to boycott the apex court for two hours Thursday. SCBA is unbent on its programme. The association decided to boycott the Appellate Division from 9am to 11am Thursday to protest the apex court's recent verdicts including that of May 11 which scuttled scope for the High Court to approve bail in cases filed under emergency powers rules. At a press conference at the hall room of the Bar Association's extended building, Mahbub said "general lawyers" would not join the boycott programme. He alleged that the SCBA had announced the programme violating the association's constitution. "Some office bearers have launched this anti-people's programme to push their own agenda and to further their political ideology," Mahbub alleged. "If anybody is aggrieved by the verdict there is scope to appeal for reconsideration. There is no scope to react this way to a unanimous verdict of the Appellate Division." Mahbub also said the SCBA cannot be a platform for a political party. In instant reaction to the comment, SCBA president barrister Shafique Ahmed said the boycott was a unanimous decision taken at a meeting on May 11. "If anybody had differed with the decision at the time, they could have spoken out. It is unnecessary to oppose the decision now in a secret press conference," he said. SCBA secretary Nurul Islam Sujan and vice-president Shafiqul Islam Babul were also present during barrister Shafique's press briefing. Mahbub ran for SCBA president in the last election, but lost out to barrister Shafique by 100 votes. bdnew
