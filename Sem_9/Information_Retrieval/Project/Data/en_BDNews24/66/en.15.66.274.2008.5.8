 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  Telecoms experts predict that teledensity in Bangladesh will reach 80 percent of the population by 2012 and have stressed making the telecommunication policy to take information technology forward. A seminar on "Telecom and ICT Industry in Bangladesh: the past, the present and the future" underlined the need for coordination between information technology and telecommunication ministries. In 2007, the contribution by the mobile sector to GDP was more than 1 percent, World Bank senior ICT specialist Tenzin Dolma Norbhu said. "In 2006 a total of $27 million has been earned from the information technology sector. Teledensity in Bangladesh will reach 80 percent by 2012," she said. "Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission needed financial independence," she said. In 2006, BTRC contributed Tk 700 crore to the government exchequer whereas the budget for BTRC was only Tk 5 crore. BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said: "There is a cloud of mistrust in the telecoms sector in Bangladesh. The mistrust is between the government and entrepreneurs." "Information technology and telecommunication sectors have to be brought under the same umbrella. They have to be brought under the same ministry," Alam said. The BTRC chief said Bangladesh would have its own satellite soon. "Bangladesh got two orbits and it would take at least eight years to set up one." "A joint initiative can be taken to set up a satellite," he said. Referring to cuts in charges on submarine cable bandwidth for call centres, Alam said the charges were excessively high. "Charges have been reduced by 60 percent for call centres," he said. "We will consider more cuts." Grameenphone chief executive officer Anders Jensen said that five lakh people are dependent on the mobile phone sector. Jensen said that 87 percent of areas and 98 percent of people are now under the mobile phone network. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute organised organised the seminar. Its president Farooq Sobhan said the listing of mobile companies on the stock market would increase mobility. He said the government and private sectors would have to work in partnership for taking forward the information technology sector. Telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmood assured that the problems raised at the seminar would be solved. "There are many things on the table. We would be able to provide a number of solutions soon," he Mahmood said. "The government will not get involved in business. It will play the role of a facilitator." bdnews24.
