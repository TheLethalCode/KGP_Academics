 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will address the nation Monday evening, two advisers said Sunday. Local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal and communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters separately at the Secretariat that the interim government head's speech would carry specific directives on lifting the state of emergency, lifting the ban on indoor politics and the dialogue with the political parties. While leaving office before noon, Iqbal told reporters that the CA would deliver his speech in the evening. Quader said to reporters about the same time, "We hope the chief adviser's speech will clearly convey tomorrow (Monday) what the government is thinking about lifting the emergency, lifting the ban on indoor politics and the ensuing dialogue with the political parties." "Once the chief adviser has delivered his speech, letters will be sent to the political parties inviting them to the dialogue," he said. Asked if Fakhruddin was likely to say anything about detained former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina or Khaleda Zia in his address, the adviser said, "I don't know anything about this issue." On the preparations for the dialogue, the adviser said, "We have already done our pre-dialogue talking. But we are continuing with our sittings. We'll have a session today as well." bdnews24.com/
