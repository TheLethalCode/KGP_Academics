 CENTURION, South Africa, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa won the toss in their Champions Trophy match against New Zealand on Thursday, captain Graeme Smith opting to bowl first. South Africa are unchanged from the side who lost Tuesday's tournament curtain raiser to Sri Lanka, Hashim Amla continuing to open the batting in place of the injured Herschelle Gibbs. The hosts must beat New Zealand or will be relying on a series of unlikely results to go their way in order to stay in the tournament. New Zealand have brought in reserve wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins as a specialist batsman and will be playing just one frontline spinner in captain Daniel Vettori. Teams South Africa - Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Roelof van der Merwe, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn. New Zealand - Brendon McCullum, Jesse Ryder, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Neil Broom, Gareth Hopkins, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey,
