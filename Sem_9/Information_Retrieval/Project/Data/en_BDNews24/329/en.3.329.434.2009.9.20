 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)--The Shawal moon is highly likely to be sighted in the sky on Sunday evening, according to the Met Office. If the moon is sighted on Sunday evening, this will be the first time in many years that Bangladesh will officially be celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr after 29 days of fasting. In recent years, Ramadan has always been a 30-day month. This will also mean an uncomfortable break in the 11-day unofficial vacation, forcing offices to open on Wednesday and Thursday (Sept 23-24). The government declared public holiday on Sept 20, 21 and 22. The holiday will extend if the Eid falls on Sept 22. Government offices will also remain open on Sunday, Sep 27, before another holiday for Durga Puja on Sep 28. Arjumand Habib, director of the Directorate of Meteorology, told bdnews24.com on Sunday that considering the permanent calendar, the moon will be sighted on Sunday evening if the sky remains clear. "There are clouds at some places but not everywhere. So, it is expected that the moon will be viewed somewhere." Meteorologist Rashiduzzaman said, if the sky remains clear, the moon will be viewed in the evening. "The moon will be seen until 26 minutes after the sunset. This time the altitude of the moon is 10.30 minutes," he said. "The moon is usually viewed in 7-8 degrees altitude. That's why we assume that the moon will be viewed if the sky remains clear," Rashiduzzaman added. The National Moon-Sighting Committee will sit at 7:30pm at the Islamic Foundation auditorium, with state minister for religious affairs Mohammed Shahjahan Miah in the chair. The meeting will announce the date of Eid, Monday (Sept 21) or Tuesday (Sept 22), depending on whether the moon is sighted on Sunday, indicating an end to the month of Ramadan. People have been asked to inform the committee through phone or fax if the moon is viewed from any place of the country. The telephone numbers are: 9556407, 9555951, 9555947, 9559643 and 9558337 and fax numbers are 02-99563397. City people are going to their home districts to enjoy the long vacation of Eid and Durga Puja. Most homebound people already left Dhaka, but the bus and launch terminals and railway stations were crowded even on Sunday. Many rode the roofs of buses or trains risking their lives to celebrate the Eid with their dear ones. b
