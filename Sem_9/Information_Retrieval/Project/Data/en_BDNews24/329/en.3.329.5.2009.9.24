 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)--The National Committee for Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports laid siege to the Petrobangla headquarters in Dhaka on Thursday in protest at the government's move to sign deals with the two foreign companies on offshore gas exploration. The public pressure group, tied to left-leaning parties, staged a sit-in programme in front of the state-owned exploration authority's office from 11am to 1pm under police cordon. Sheikh Muhammad Shahidullah, the committee convener, at a brief rally said the government was pressing on with the deals to smuggling out oil and gas to the foreigners. "We have to thwart the move. There is no alternative to it if we want to leave a prosperous Bangladesh for our future generation," he said. If the deal was made, the committee would launch impromptu street agitation, the convener said. The committee ended the programme with a procession to Shahbagh. The pressure group will organise conferences in divisional headquarters Khulna, Barisal, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet respectively on Oct 3, 5, 7, 10 and 13, ahead of a national convention in Dhaka on Oct 16. If the government changes its stance, the programme will be changed, Shahidullah said. Bangladesh approved the offshore deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow on Aug 24 for oil and gas exploration in three sea blocks of the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters of the blocks. The pressure committee said the PSC sample 'Model PSC-2008' made by the last caretaker government regime was against public interest. The parliamentary standing committee on energy and power ministry on Sept 16 alleged that the national committee had "confused" the public with incorrect information. Subid Ali Bhuiyan, the committee's chairman, said that day they would sit with leaders of the pressure group in 15 days to discuss the issue. His committee pointed out that there was no provision for exporting 80 percent of gas extracted in the PSC with the two companies. The next day, the national committee said it would accept any formal invitation of the government to sit in discussion, provided the proceedings of gas exploration deals are halted. Shahidullah claimed that the "hidden terms" of the contracts say Bangladesh will get paid for only 20 percent of gas extracted and the contractor will not be bound to pay for piping the rest to land, even if the government wants to buy it. He said, "In reality Bangladesh will not be able to spend the money needed to set up pipelines from the deep sea if it wants to buy the gas, and the contractor will get the opportunity to do whatever it wants to with the gas." He said at the very least a directorate for the sea affairs should be established to handle matters firmly. The committee's member secretary and economics teacher Professor Anu Muhammad and dozens other demonstrators were injured on Sep 2 in police assault on their way to besiege Petrobangla office. The citizen's group enforced a half-day hartal in capital Dhaka, the first in nearly three years, on Sept 14 in protest at the deals and gave the government until Oct 15 to meet their five-point charter of demands. The five-point charter of demands includes the cancellation of the model oil-gas distribution agreements, cancellation of leases given to two foreign firms for three offshore blocks, formulation of new model production-sharing contract ensuring 100 percent public ownership, full implementation of Phulbari Agreement 2006 and punishment to the attackers of member secretary Anu Muhammad and others. The country's proven gas reserves are approximately 15 trillion cubic feet, of which 8.3 trillion cubic feet have been extracted, according to government estimates. bdnew
