 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)--Government and private offices, along with banks, opened again on Wednesday after the three-day Eid holiday and the weekends, but the attendance was very poor. Less than 40 percent people joined their works in the Secretariat, Ruhul Amin, acting official of special department of police of the Secretariat said. "Though the rate of presence was 60 percent after earlier Eid vacations this time the presence is only 40 percent," he said. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, law minister Shafique Ahmed and civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader went to the Secretariat up to 11:15am. Some 10-12 ministers attended their workplace after the midday. Most of them were busy exchanging greetings. The situation was same with private offices. The roads in the capital were almost empty with very few traffic. Rains also disrupted the movement of the office-goers. There were rushes in the bus and launch terminals and railway stations from Wednesday morning as people who had gone to their home districts returned. A previous order that said offices may remain closed on Wednesday is no more effective since Eid-ul-Fitr day fell on Monday. This year, the official Eid holiday was just three days, following four-day vacations over the last three consecutive years. The holiday began from Sept 20, though most office-goers got a five-day vacation including the previous Fri-Sat weekend. Others, who took the trouble to travel to home districts for the festival, are likely to have an even lengthier vacation, taking extra leave on Wednesday and Thursday followed by the coming weekend. Normal 9am-5pm office timings will resume from Wednesday after a curtailed 9am-4pm working day during Ramadan. Another public holiday is due for Durga Puja at the start of next week. It was the first time in many years that Bangladesh officially celebrated the Eid-ul-Fitr after 29 days of fasting. The Eid being held on Monday meant an uncomfortable break in the 11-day unofficial vacation, forcing offices to open on Wednesday and Thursday (Sept 23-24). bdnews24
