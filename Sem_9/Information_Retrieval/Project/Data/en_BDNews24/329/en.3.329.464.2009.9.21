<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)Capital Dhaka and the rest of Bangladesh were shaken by what many described as a 'big tremor' on Monday. The Met Office said it struck at around 3:53pm, but could not immediately confirm the magnitude or epicentre. Some Dhaka residents said they felt it was an "unusually big jolt" for the capital. Reports came in of tall buildings in the city swaying with the force. The tremor spread some panic among people celebrating Eid and somewhat dampened the mood of the day, that began with thunder and downpours of rain in the morning. bdnews24.com correspondents from Mymensingh, Sherpur, Rangpur, Sirajganj, Tangail, Sunamganj and Nilphamari correspondents said the jolt was also felt in those districts. bdnews24.com's Panchagharh correspondent also said it was felt in the northwest. Meteorologist Rasheduzzman told bdnews24.com it takes at least half an hour to get precise information. The last quake to shake Bangladesh was felt in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet on Sept 4. The magnitude 6 quake was centred at the India-Myanmar border, east of Bangladesh. Earlier on Aug 11, Bangladesh was shaken by tremors as a major quake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India's Andaman Islands, sparking a tsunami warning in the region. bdnews24
