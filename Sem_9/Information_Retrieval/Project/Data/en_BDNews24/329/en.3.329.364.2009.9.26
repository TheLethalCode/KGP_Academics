 New York, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the world to allow Bangladesh a say in the decision-making on global peacekeeping operations and recognise Bangla as an official language of the UN. In her 35-minute address, in Bangla, to the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Saturday, she also asked world leaders to reach accord on climate change, economic downturn and terrorism challenges. She said Bangladesh, which will face millions of displaced people due to sea level rise by 2050, will strongly demand an international commitment to rehabilitate the climate refugees at the climate change negotiations in December. Prime minister Hasina, whose father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the first to address the Assembly in Bangla on Sep 23, 1974, said: "Climate change has for some time been adversely impacting our low lying, deltaic, monsoonal country. "Though Bangladesh's contribution to climate change is negligible, it is one of its worst victims." She said river bank erosion, landslides, soil degradation and deforestation were making millions people "climate change refugees" in Bangladesh. "What is alarming is that a meter rise in sea level would inundate 18 percent of our land mass, directly impacting 11 percent of our people," the prime minister told the audience. She said scientific estimates indicated that climate change would displace billion of people around the world by 2050. "One in every 45 people in the world, and one in every 7 people in Bangladesh, would be a (climate) victim." "Bangladesh would, of course, make a strong call for climate migrants at COP 15 (conference of parties) to consider a new legal regime under the UNFCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) protocol ensuring social, cultural and economic rehabilitation of climate induced displaced migrants," said Hasina. The UN members will meet in Copenhagen in December to finalise a new agreement on emission cut to combat climate change. The displacement of people by the rising sea level is still an unresolved issue at the climate negotiations. Hasina said rapid, unplanned urbanisation, occupational dislocations, food, water and land insecurity are some of the consequences of climate change. The prime minister urged the international community to provide necessary funds for the adaptation of the climate change victims in the poorer countries. "A Climate Change Trust Fund has been established with our own resources; but to implement the projects, assistance of the international community is imperative." "The post 2012 agreement should incorporate predictable and legally binding commitments to address the adaptation needs of low lying coastal states, small island countries, and LDCs," said the prime minister. She said her government had adopted a policy of dredging the rivers to increase the water containing capacity of the rivers. Hasina said the global economic recession harmed the economically-vulnerable least-developed countries (LDCs). "The economically vulnerable countries as the LDCs, not responsible for this crisis, have become its worst victims "Bangladesh is faced with sharp reduction in exports, falling prices of primary commodities, declining remittances, severe credit crunch, leading to contraction of our economic growth, rising unemployment and poverty." She said the crisis had been due to "years of negligence to equity and justice, including basically an unfair international financial structure that never changed with the changing needs of time". "The need of the hour is immediate restructuring of the global financial and economic system. "The Brettonwoods institutions, that is, the World Bank and the IMF must accommodate stronger presence of developing countries, especially LDCs. Indeed, voting weight proportionate to share capital has proved unsuitable for the Brettonwoods," she said. Arguing the case for adoption of Bangla as one of the languages at the UN, Hasina said UNESCO recognised February 21 as the International Mother Language Day honouring Bangladesh's language movement in 1952. "The language Bangla is spoken by over 250 million people worldwide, primarily in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. "The Bangladesh Parliament, therefore, recently adopted a resolution requesting the United Nations to declare Bangla as one of its official languages. "Given the rich heritage of Bangla language, and its singular place as a symbol of people's faith in the power of languages to sustain cultures, and indeed the identity of nations, I seek support of the membership of UNGA for its acceptance as an official language of the United Nations," said the prime minister. On contribution to the UN peace keeping operations, Hasina said Bangladesh had been involved in 32 peace keeping missions in 24 different countries involving around 83,000 personnel since 1988. "Today, Bangladesh is ranked the second with 9,567 peacekeepers in various UN missions. Through the years, it is with pride I say that 84 of our valiant peacekeepers have laid down their lives for the cause of UN sponsored peace," she said. "Sadly, despite our contribution and sacrifice, Bangladesh does not have a proportionate representation in the Department of Peace Keeping Operations, nor does it have a say in the planning and strategies of peace keeping missions. "Indeed, this situation calls for rectification, on the basis of proportional representation in all fairness," said Hasina. The prime minister said Bangladesh was opposed to any form of terrorism. "Bangladesh is a party to all terrorism related UN Conventions, a testament to our commitment to fighting this malaise. "We categorically reject claims of those who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of Islam, or any other faith to justify violence," she said. "Nation-wise, we have taken stern measures against militant groups and their patrons. "Firmly opposed to violence and terrorism, and instead promoting peace across the world, Bangladesh, in UNGA Sessions, spearheads the flagship resolution on 'Culture of Peace'." She said at the World Summit on Food Security, slated for Rome in November, Bangladesh would seek a global agreement on the development of agriculture, and food autarky particularly in in least-developed countries. Hasina's sister Rehana Siddique, son Sajeeb Wajed Joy and his wife Kristine Wazed, daughter Saima Wazed Hossain and her husband Khandker Mashroor Hossain, nephew Redwan Siddiq and Azmina Siddique also listened to the address. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, the prime minister's adviser Gowher Rizvi, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, foreign secretary Mijarul Quayes, ambassador-designate to the US Akramul Qader, permanent representative to the UN Abdul Momen, ambassador to Brussels Ismat Jahan, Prof Mustafa Nurul Islam, PM's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad were also present, among others. bdnews24.c
