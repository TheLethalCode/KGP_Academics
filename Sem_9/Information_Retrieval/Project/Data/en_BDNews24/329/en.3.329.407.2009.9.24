 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)--Former Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil has alleged that the party leaders who are now in the cabinet have links with the military's intelligence. "Ninety nine percent Awami League leaders who are in the cabinet have connections with Directorate General of Forces Intelligence," Jalil said in a brief interview with a London-based Bangla TV channel on Tuesday. "They only failed to control me," he added. "If you study my statements you will notice that I defended Sheikh Hasina (the party chief and incumbent prime minister). I stood beside her," said Jalil. On the caretaker government, the AL MP said: "They realised that if the party secretary remains vocal it would be difficult for them to make their purpose successful, that is to remove the leader." "The great alliance has come to the power through an understanding. So I think there is an understanding between coming to power and the sweeping victory," he said. About the incumbent general secretary, Syed Ashraful Islam, Jalil said he had fled the country after the promulgation of the state of emergency. Sheikh Rehana, the younger sister of the incumbent prime minister, later arranged his return to Dhaka after consulting with DGFI, Jalil claimed. The former AL general secretary observed that politicians did not take any lesson from the changeover of 1/11. A source said Abdul Jalil has delivered many controversial statements in the interview. The channel, which took the interview, is now facing pressure from many quarters not to broadcast it. When contacted by bdnews24.com, Firoz Khan, chairman of the Bangla TV channel, said that they had recorded the interview for a programme titled 'Janatar Mancha'. They had only broadcast a brief portion of the interview in their news bulletin, he said, adding that the channel has taken interviews of some more politicians. Asked when Jalil's interview would be telecast, Khan could not give any specific schedule or date. He declined to reply when asked if they were facing any pressure from any quarter regarding the telecast of the interview. Jalil was elected general secretary in the 19th council of the party in December, 2002. He served as commerce minister in the 1996-2001 Awami League government. Abdul Jalil resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on July 21, this year. Jalil had been arrested on May 28, 2007 and he was allowed to go to Singapore for medical treatment on paroled bail. He returned home six months later. Upon his return home, the High Court on Oct 20, 2008, granted the AL leader bail in a case related to wealth statement filed by the Anticorruption Commission. bd
