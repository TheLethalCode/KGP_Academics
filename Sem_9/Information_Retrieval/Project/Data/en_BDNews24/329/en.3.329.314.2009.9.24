The power plant belongs to Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco), in which Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd, part of the mining group Vedanta, holds 51 percent. About 100 workers and engineers were working on the chimney at Balco Nagar, several hours' drive from the Chhattisgarh capital, Raipur. "It's a massive accident," Ratanlal Dangi, district superintendent of police, told Reuters by telephone. "We have retrieved 20 bodies so far. Still many more are trapped under the collapsed chimney's debris. Massive rescue and relief operations are under way."
