 Shehabuddin Kisslu, from New York New York, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)--The World Bank has assured Bangladesh of assistance to build social safety net, alleviate poverty and develop infrastructure. World Bank president Robert Zoellick gave the assurance during a meeting with prime minister Sheikh Hasina at Grand Hyatt New York at 5pm (local time) on Wednesday. Hasina informed him of her administration's efforts to build a social safety net through poverty alleviation and fight the impacts of climate change. Her democratic government is working to ensure an improved standard of life for the people, Hasina said. The prime minister said the government is working to generate more employments and ensure healthcare for people at a cheap rate. Talks were also held between them over various challenges of global climate change and national, regional and international issues. It is a pity that global climate change stood in the way of various developed projects of Bangladesh though the country did emit greenhouse gases much, she pointed out. The government plans to dredge rivers, reclaim land, erect more embankments and grow forests along the coast, she also informed Zoellick. Her administration is doing making its best efforts to face the recurring natural disasters due to increasing global temperature, but it is not possible to face global challenge without a concerted effort, she mentioned. Hasina' son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, foreign minister Dipu Moni, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, foreign secretary Mijarul Kayes, alternative executive director of the World Bank Quazi Aminul Islam, deputy press secretary to the prime minister Mahbubul Haque Shakil were present at the meeting. bd
