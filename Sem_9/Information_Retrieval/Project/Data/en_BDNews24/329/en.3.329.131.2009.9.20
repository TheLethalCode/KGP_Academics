 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury and Golam Mortuja Antu Dhaka, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government's strategy to combat militancy and terrorism through a 'motivation' programme targeting religious institutions, among others, is yet to get off the ground, officials say, though the home ministry says the programme is underway. The plan was supposed to take in educational institutions and the media as well as mosques, to encourage them to spread anti-militancy and anti-terrorism messages, but efforts have so far fallen short, a top official of Rapid Action Battalion, the elite anti-crime and anti-terrorism force, has said. "We are stuck in the first phase of containing militancy and terrorism," the official, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com this week. "We are yet to tackle the source of militancy or recruitment processes to prevent terrorism. We are only catching them in the act of destruction." In particular, the anti-militancy campaign appears to have fallen short in the nation's mosques during the month of Ramadanwhen mosques see some of their largest gatheringsdespite government directives. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku directed mosque leaders, ahead of Ramadan, to disseminate anti-militancy messages following Tarabi and Jummah prayers as a part of the motivation programme. But many mosque goers say they did not hear any anti-militancy discourse from the Imams. Correspondents from districts as widespread as Brahmanbaria, Jamalpur and Thakurgaon said they have not heard any such message in their mosques. Muslims in the capital flocked to the national mosque on Jumatul Wida, the last Friday of Ramadan to hear Maolana Salauddin, Khatib of Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, deliver a 15-minute khutba sermon to mark the special day. But, the mosque goers said, Salauddin did not deliver any anti-militancy message. The government formed a special committee in April, headed by the then state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, to formulate and monitor an anti-militancy strategy. Its first meeting was held on May 12 at the home ministry. The second meeting was held on August 11 after Shamsul Haque Tuku took over as state minister for home. The 17-member body includes secretaries from the prime minister's office, home, education, law, religion, social welfare, information and local government ministries. It also includes the inspector general of police, heads of DGFI, NSI, BDR, RAB and other law enforcing agencies. In addition to ongoing drives by law enforcers, the committee formulated short-term strategies, mid-term and longer-term strategies to combat militancy, Tanjim Ahmed had said after the first meeting in May. One of the short-term strategies was a 'motivation' campaign of anti-militancy messages, to counter the spread of militant ideology and propaganda. But officials are issuing contradictory statements on where the campaign stands. According to the state minister for home, the anti-militancy message is being spread in mosques. Tuku told bdnews24.com on Friday: "We have directed mosques to disseminate the information that militancy is the great enemy of the state." "Imams of the mosques I have attended are delivering anti-militancy sermons. I have heard anti-militancy sermons at the High Court mosque. I believe it is going on in all mosques." "But there may be exceptions," said Tuku. A deputy secretary of home told bdnews24.com, "The committee has held only two meetings since April. I don't think there has been much advancement in the campaign." "The committee has discussed the issue, and what directions to give to concerned agencies for the motivation campaign. But I don't know how far they are being implemented. The progress is not worth mentioning," he said. Secretary for religion Abdur Rab Hawladar told bdnews24.com on Thursday that he did not have specific information on how the motivation campaign was progressing. Tuku has said the campaign will be evaluated at the next meeting of the committee. The next decision will be taken after evaluation and discussing the matter with Khatibs of different mosques and officials of the Islamic Foundation, he told bdnews24.com. It will also be discussed with Imams divisionally if needed in future, he said. The RAB official, meanwhile, told bdnews24.com, "Everyone would realise the terrible impact of militancy and fight together against those involved in these activities if the religious leaders explain where militancy and terrorism stand in the eyes of Islam." bdnews24.
