 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) The government's initiative to amend the constitution and revoke the provision of the caretaker government is farfetched, the party's secretary-general says. "The [ruling] Awami League is plotting to come to power again by rigging votes," Khandaker Delwar Hossain said to bdnews24.com on Friday. Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Thursday said his ministry would write to the Law Commission for amending the country's constitution. Recommendations for bringing necessary amendment to the constitution will be prepared on the basis of the Commission's opinions, he told reporters. On the same day, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said the AL will not seek to change the constitution even though it enjoys absolute majority. "They want to hold elections themselves by abolishing the caretaker government system through amendment to the constitution. The people will not accept it." "They (the government) have realised they cannot go to power the next time this way ( by 'rigging')." He said BNP opposes the abolition of the caretaker government system. Delwar said, "To cancel the caretaker government system, public opinions will have to be elicited alongside the views of the majority MPs in parliament." Asked if they will return to parliament, he said the main opposition party wants to go back to parliament. But the government has not ensured the atmosphere to facilitate its return. BNP has been staying away the proceedings since the first session. "Our leader (BNP chiarperson Khaleda Zia) has always been speaking of assisting the government. But the government has been refusing it," Delar complained. b
