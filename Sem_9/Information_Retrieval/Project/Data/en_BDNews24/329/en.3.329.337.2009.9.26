<TEXT>
 Feni, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com)--Ruling Awami League policymaker Obaidul Quader has set aside MP Abdul Jalil's suggestion that Awami League had come to power following an understanding with the military- installed caretaker government. "Mr Jalil has disgraced popular verdict by questioning the fairness and neutrality of the election," Quader told the reporters during a meeting at Feni circuit house around 9pm on Friday. He said, "It is in no way proper to speak of the internal affairs of the party as well as the country abroad." "Poll observers from home and abroad were unanimous about the fairness and neutrality of the election." The disgruntled former AL general secretary in an interview with bdnews24.com on Thursday said that he had made a mistake by not going against the party chief, Sheikh Hasina, on his return to the country to protect his post during the 2007-08 caretaker government regime. Hours earlier, a London-based ethnic TV station had aired excerpts of an interview in which Jalil repeated his trademark tirade against the military intelligence outfit DGFI. On the row with Myanmar over maritime boundary, Quader said, "Myanmar, rather than India, has become a concern for us." "It is trying to possess atomic energy in cooperation with North Korea," he said "Myanmar has posed a threat to us by sending ships into our maritime boundary a few months back," he said On the success of the government, Quader said, "The government is keen on solving the key issues on priority basis." Jalil said: "Sheikh Hasina ordered me from America to take rest," he said of her pre-election decision, adding he did not protest the leader's command. "My decision was wrong. I should have taken her head-on," he told bdnews24.com. During the interview, Jalil spoke of his resignation from party secretary post, party and parliamentary election. Jalil has said 90 percent' ministers of the incumbent government are 'reformists'--people who propagated the so-called reform moves in the party to sideline Hasina, allegedly with the patronage of the military-installed interim government. Asked to elaborate on his comment on his claim of a "deal" between the AL and the caretaker government on the elections, he said: "It might have happened." Jalil alleged that Awami League had won landslide victory following an understanding with the army backed caretaker goverment. Jalil was elected general secretary in the 19th council of the party in December, 2002. He served as commerce minister in the 1996-2001 Awami League government. Jalil resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on July 21 this year. Jalil had been arrested on May 28, 2007 and he was allowed to go to Singapore for medical treatment on paroled bail. He returned home six months later. bdnews2
