 LOS ANGELES, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Megan Fox's black leather motorcycle costume, a 17-foot-tall robot and more than 100 other props, costumes and set pieces from the "Transformers" movie franchise are going up for auction near Los Angeles next month. Auctioneer Profiles in History said it expected the 3,200 pound (1.45 ton) Hero Bumblebee robot from the first movie in 2007 to fetch $60,000 to $80,000 at the Oct 8-9 auction. The motorcycle costume worn by Fox as Mikaela Banes in the blockbuster 2009 sequel "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen", along with her shorts and tank top, have an estimate of $3,000 to $5,000. Joe Maddalena, president of Profiles in History, said anything worn by Fox was in great demand by collectors. "'Transformers' made her a star and I expect her costumes to perform very well at auction. The 17-foot Bumblebee robot speaks for itself ... it's such an amazing spectacle and a pop culture icon that I expect bidders to go crazy," Maddalena said. The disassembled robot is currently stored in boxes. All the items were consigned by the films' Viacom Inc-owned distributor, Paramount Pictures, and their director, Michael Bay. Bids can be placed in person at the auction in Calabasas, outside Los Angeles, by phone or live on the Internet (here). Fox helped "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" become the biggest grossing movie of 2009, with worldwide box-office takings of $831 million. The two movies have grossed $1.5 billion worldwide
