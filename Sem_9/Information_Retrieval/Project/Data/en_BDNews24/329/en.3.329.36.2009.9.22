 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Falun, Sept 21 (bdnnews24.com)  Sweden announced its national budget for 2010 on Monday, termed a "crisis budget" by Swedish finance minister Anders Borg. One year ahead of parliamentary elections, Sweden's centre-right government presented a budget bill with a backdrop of the weakest growth performance in a single year since World War II. The budget bill includes 32 billion kronor ($4.62 billion) in stimulus measures for 2010 and 24 billion kronor for 2011. According to online newspaper STOCKHOLM NEWS, Borg told the Swedish parliament that the only way to survive the crisis is through work. Introducing the budget, Borg said additional means would be provided to dampen the negative consequences of the global economic crisis. "By promoting jobs and supporting the unemployed we want to ensure a speedier recovery. Let us hope we will see better times" he said. Another Swedish online newspaper, 'The Local', said quoted Norg as saying, "We are trying to limit damage from the crisis by taking forceful action to promote jobs and enterprise and by providing support to everyone who has been severely hit by unemployment." Borg was optimistic about Sweden's recovery. "For special measures to limit damages in the aftermath of the crisis the government has set aside 4.6 billion dollars," he said. Growth of 0.6 percent was seen for 2010, before a robust return of 3.1 percent in 2011 and 3.8 percent in 2012. But unemployment was seen rising to 8.8 percent this year, 11.4 percent in 2010 and 11.6 percent in 2011, before falling back to 10.9 percent in 2012. The 2010 measures include 10 billion kronor in income tax cuts aimed at encouraging more Swedes to work instead of living off generous state subsidies. The present Swedish government won the 2006 election on promises to fight unemployment and to make it more profitable to work. The opposition is critical of the budget. The Social Democratic spokesperson for economy, Thomas stros, claims that most of the tax reliefs benefit the wealthiest part of the population. But the Institute of Economic Research welcomed the budget proposal. Institute Director Mats Dilln told the TT news agency that he was pleasantly surprised by the planned efforts to pave the way for economic recovery. He added that his institute had recommended even more decisive steps in the direction taken by the government, but that the chosen course was the right one. "There just are no surefire strategies," Dilln said.
