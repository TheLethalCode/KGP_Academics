<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka Zoo is being prepared to welcome crowds of visitors over the Eid holidays, despite the deaths of three large animals in recent weeks and many more in ailing condition. As many as 21 rare animals have died in one year and three animals died in last two weeks--the aging Royal Bengal Tiger, Garjan, died on Sept 12, lion Ringo on Sept 10 and a giraffe on Sept 7. After the death of the giraffe, the authorities had temporarily suspended the zoo curator and deputy curator and formed a probe committee to investigate the deaths of the animals at the country's largest zoo. A number of other animals are also in poor condition, sources at the zoo said. But authorities are taking special security measures and cleaning up the zoo, expecting some one lakh visitors during the Eid vacation. The zoo publicity officer, Saiful Islam, said the authorities are taking all measures to entertain the visitors. "We see 1 lakh to 1.25 lakh visitors during the Eid vacation each year," he said. The authorities have sought security assistance from police and RAB. Some 20 Ansar members will perform additional duty inside the zoo and will be posted at different points of the zoo, Islam said. A control room will be set up inside the zoo for one week from the Eid day where the visitors will be given assistance and guideline, the official said. Cleanup drive started at the zoo from last Wednesday that was likely to end before Eid, he added. On the consecutive death of animals, the publicity official said it is difficult to operate the zoo with only one veterinary physician. "The livestock minister has assured us of recruitment of more veterinary doctors we have demanded. "We hope two new veterinary physicians will join the zoo after the Eid," he said. No new animal has arrived in the zoo in recent times. Animals, such as peacock, donkey and impala, have given birth to babies over the last three months, Islam said. Sprawling over 186 acres of land, the Dhaka Zoo at Mirpur has more than 2,000 animals of some 150 species. The zoo receives as many as 10,000 visitors on an average every day. bd
