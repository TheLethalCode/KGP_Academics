<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia pace bowler Nathan Bracken will miss the Champions Trophy due to a knee injury, the Australian cricket board said on Thursday. The left-arm bowler is suffering pain in his right knee and will return home to consult a specialist, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement. "The nature of Nathan's right knee problem has meant that he has had some ongoing manageable pain, but this has now reached a point where he is unable to continue playing in the ICC Champions Trophy," Australia's physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said. "His return to cricket will be determined after consulting the specialist." World champions Australia will open their title defence with a preliminary group match against the West Indies on Saturday. India and Twenty20 champions Pakistan are the other two teams in the group. Australia have yet to name a replacement.
