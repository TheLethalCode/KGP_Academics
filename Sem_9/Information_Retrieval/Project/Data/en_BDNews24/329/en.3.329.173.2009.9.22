 MANILA, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine troops killed more than 30 Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and overran the rebels' main base on a remote island in the south of the country, a top military commander said Tuesday. "We will not stop until such time that they are destroyed," Lieutenant-General Ben Dolorfino, commander of military forces in the southern Philippines, told reporters, referring to the Abu Sayyaf militants. Dolorfino said about 15 militants were killed late on Monday when troops fought an estimated 100 Abu Sayyaf guerrillas who ambushed a military convoy in Indanan town, where eight soldiers were killed and nine wounded. At least 34 Abu Sayyaf have been killed since Sunday, when troops, backed by air strikes, assaulted a fortified rebel base in the hilly interior of the southern island of Jolo, Dolorfino said, adding dozens were also wounded. Dolorfino described the capture of the Abu Sayyaf stronghold near Indanan town as a major tactical and strategic accomplishment, denying militants a sanctuary and a training base on Jolo island. Jolo is the stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf rebels, one of the smallest but deadliest Islamist militant groups in the largely Roman Catholic Philippine. It was blamed for the country's worst militant attack, a ferry bombing near Manila Bay that killed 100 people in February 2004. Dolorfino said the military could have pre-empted a key meeting of the Abu Sayyaf because three of its top leaders -- Umbra Jumdail, Albader Parad and Isnilon Hapilon -- were in the areas when the fighting erupted Sunday. He said the rebels also lost Isnilon's trusted lieutenant and relative, Ustadz Muktar, who was killed Monday. Local officials on Jolo island said hundreds of families from remote villages around Indanan had fled their homes and farms due to two days of fighting.
