 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 25 (Reuters) - All-rounder James Franklin will replace the injured Jacob Oram in New Zealand's Champions Trophy squad, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a statement on Friday. Oram damaged his hamstring in training and missed New Zealand's opening match against hosts South Africa on Thursday when they lost by five wickets. Franklin, 28, has played in 26 tests and 65 ODIs, taking 80 and 64 wickets respectively. His last ODI was against Sri Lanka in the 2007 World Cup in West Indies, taking two for 46 in New Zealand's 81-run semi-final defeat. New Zealand's second match in the Champions Trophy is on Sunday against Sri Lanka at the Wanderers.
