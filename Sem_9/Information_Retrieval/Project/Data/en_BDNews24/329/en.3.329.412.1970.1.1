 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)--The law ministry will write to the Law Commission for amending the country's constitution, the law minister said on Thursday. Based on the Commission's opinions, the recommendations will be prepared, Shafique Ahmed told newsmen at the Secretariat. But, no timetable will be set for the Commission to make the suggestions, he added. "We have moved away a lot from the spirit of liberation war and its ideals-based stance. The constitution needs updating in the interests of good governance and democracy." The constitution has been tinkered with many times; many things against the spirit of liberation war and democracy have been added to it, Ahmed said. "The role of the constitution is important to give institutional shape to democracy in real sense." "The Law Commission will be asked to have a look at these aspects and the recommendations for amending the constitution will be made based upon their opinions." The constitution has been amended 14 times since it was adopted in 1972. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam in the same day said any change to the constitution will be made on popular consensus, and the ruling party will not impose its overwhelming majority in parliament,. bdnews2
