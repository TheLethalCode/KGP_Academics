 Dhaka, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)The government needs support of the private sector and the international community as well to fight the impact of climate change in Bangladesh, an MP said on Saturday. "The government can't manage the whole thing by itself," Sanjida Khanam MP said at a discussion titled 'Bangladesh National Meeting on Citizens' View on Global Warming' at BRAC Centre Inn in Dhaka. Sanjida said the allocation of Tk 700 crore in the current budget will be utilised through some effective programmes to mitigate the probable disasters. The dialogue was organised by Integrated Community and Industrial Development Initiative in Bangladesh (INCIDIN Bangladesh), partner of World Wide Views on Global Warming, to gather the opinion of the people from around the country, who will be the prime victim of climate change. Around 100 participants shared their experience and recommendations in the day-long sessions. The findings of the programme will be revealed to the press on Sunday. The meeting will convey the opinions of the people to concerned government officials and experts to influence the policy making process to face the onslaughts of climate change. Bangladesh will join the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15), to be attended by representatives and experts from 68 countries, in Copenhagen, Denmark in December. In his speech, AKM Mustaque Ali, executive director of INCIDIN Bangladesh, said the common people, who will be the prime victim of climate change, should speak out about their problems and the government should listen to them before preparing strategies for facing the challenge. Experts say Bangladesh is bracing for a rise in sea level caused by global warming the fallout of which will be increased salinity and recurrent cyclones in the coastal seaboard. Due to the current changes in climate, pattern of rainfall would change triggering a rise in the water level of the rivers on the one hand, while on the other, the same rivers would go dry during the dry season. Both the situation would adversely affect the country's agriculturethe mainstay of the national economyas well as forests, fisheries, industries and infrastructures. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says average temperature in the atmosphere and on the ground level will be increasing gradually while geographically, Bangladesh would acutely vulnerable to the fallout of global warming. As a result of global warming and climate change, the country would face water crisis, loss of land, social crisis while poverty is expected to rise drastically. The country's food security would also be at stake.
