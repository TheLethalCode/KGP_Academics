 NEW DELHI, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will launch production of its Figo small car in India in early 2010, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The car was showcased at a news conference in the Indian capital. Ford has invested $500 million at a plant in Chennai and has said the plant was gearing up for production of a small car. India's domestic auto market is relatively small, especially considering a population of more than 1.1 billion, with about 1.5 million passenger vehicles being sold last year and small cars account of nearly two-thirds of annual unit sales.
