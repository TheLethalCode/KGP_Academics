<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Sep 20 (bdnews24.com)Almost complete gridlock choked the Paturia ferry crossing in Manikgang district on Sunday morning, leaving thousands of homebound Eid travellers stranded for hours in the terminal area. A three-kilometre tailback developed on the Dhaka-Paturia highway by 2pm, leaving hundreds of buses, private vehicles and trucks immobilised as officials struggled to board the vehicles onto ferries. The sheer numbers of vehicles from seven in the morning created the terminal jam; it reached the highway by ten in the morning, Ashraf Hossian, commercial director of BIWTA Aricha office, told bdnews24.com. Hossain said it took more than two hours for a bus to cross the river. bdnews24.co
