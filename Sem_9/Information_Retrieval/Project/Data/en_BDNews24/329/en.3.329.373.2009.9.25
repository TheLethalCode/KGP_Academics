<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Sep24 (bdnews24.com)Arms hauled in Chittagong and Bogra during the past BNP government were smuggled in under direct government patronage, the state minister for home has alleged. Shamsul Haq Tuku made the allegation when he visited Durga Puja pavilion of Ram Krishna Mission in Narayanganj on Thursday. "We have inherited a deteriorating law and order and planned to curb terrorism by seizure of arms and ammunition," he said "But a social movement is necessary to do that," Tuku said He said Durga Puja, the greatest festival of the second largest community in Bangladesh, will be held as peacefully as Eid-ul-Fitr was. Law-enforcers have taken massive preparations to ensure security during the Puja, he added. "We are non-communal in spirit. Muslims, Hindus, Buddists and Christians liberated the nation by fighting ( against Pakistan army) in the same bunker during the great independence war." Police chief Noor Mohammad, RAB chief Hasan Mahmud Khandaker and Narayanganj municipal corporation mayor Selina Hayat Ivy accompanied the minister. The minister visited Puja pavilions at Tanbazar, Nitaiganj and Ukilpara in the town. bdnews2
