 Dhaka, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who arrived in New York on Tuesday morning local time, will join 24 other heads of government at a dinner hosted by secretary- general Ban Ki Moon in the evening, a top official said. "She's arrived and on her way to hotel," said Dr A K Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's permanent representative to the UN at 8pm Dhaka time (9am NY time). "We kept the morning free since it's been a long flight for her starting on the Eid day in Dhaka," Dr Momen said, speaking to bdnews24.com by phone. Hasina spent 21 hours on the flight, including a stop at Dubai, to reach New York and will make an appearance at the climate summit venue hours later, the ambassador said. The ambassador stressed the "exclusivity" of the event with Ban as "the dinner with the secretary-general will be attended by just 25 heads of government". The prime minister will seek to use the event to unite the worse-affected countries and resolve compensation claims for climate change, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said on Monday. Hasina left for New York on Monday night to attend the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Summit. She will address climate change issues and join in talks with leaders of countries contributing UN peacekeeping troops around the world, as part of a weeklong trip, said Quayes, who joined the prime minister's 23-member delegation to the UN assembly. Foreign minister Dipu Moni was already in New York ahead of the UN meet. Other delegation members include cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad, former envoy Mohammad Ziauddin, MP Nasrul Hamid Bipu and columnist Mustafa Nurul Islam. Hasina and US president Barack Obama are due to attend a sidelines meeting of nine countries contributing major UN peacekeeping forces around the world on Sept 23. Bangladesh is a leading contributor to the peacekeeping missions, with around 10,000 personnel from the country engaged in different missions around the world. The prime minister is scheduled to attend a luncheon hosted by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in honour of women heads of governments and women foreign ministers, on Sept 24. Hasina is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with Sri Lanka's prime minister, Kenya's prime minister the Commonwealth secretary general, and OIC secretaries general on Sept 25. She will address the General Assembly on Sept 26. The prime minister is due back on Oc
