<TITLE> Constitutional change on consensus: Ashraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)Any change to the constitution will be made based on popular consensus, and the ruling party will not impose its overwhelming majority in parliament, the local government minister has said. "The Awami League will not meddle with the constitution even though it enjoys absolute majority," Syed Ashraful Islam said to reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday. "The government would like to see the required changes such as the caretaker government system, parliamentary tenure and local government system effected based on dialogue with all instead." Ashraf, also AL general secretary, urged the main opposition BNP to return to parliament and make it more functional. "Democracy will not put down its roots until the parliament is made more effective." Ashraf expressed fear about seeing situations like 1/11 over and again until democracy is institutionalised. "All political parties will have to behave responsibly to effect that and all these deliberations must be carried out in parliament," he said. Syed Ashraf earlier exchanged post-Eid greetings with the secretariat officials and employees. Local government state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak, national assembly whip Mirza Azam, local government secretary Manzoor Hossain and others were present. bdnews2
