 RAIPUR, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rescuers have retrieved 36 bodies from the rubble of an industrial chimney that collapsed in Chhattisgarh, but officials fear the death toll could surge as dozens of workers were still missing on Friday. About 100 workers and engineers were working on the construction of a 100 metre-high (330 feet) chimney for a power plant in Chhattisgarh, when it crumbled on Wednesday after heavy rains and lightning. "The rescue operation is underway with a dozen cranes pressed into clearance work and rescuers are working cautiously to clear debris so that survivors, if any, can be pulled out," top district administrator Ashok Agrawal said. It might take rescuers a further two to three days to remove the debris, Agrawal added. Dozens of workers and women were beating their chests and weeping at the site, waiting for news about those trapped. The power plant is several hours' drive from the state capital, Raipur. It belongs to Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco), in which Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd, part of the mining group Vedanta, holds 51 percent.
