 Magura, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)Three unidentified motorcycle riding hijackers were lynched by angry mob in Magura on Wednesday night, police said. Magura sadar police sub-inspector Sardar Nizamul Haque said two of the three-strong snatchers had hired a motorcycle from Khajura Bazaar on Wednesday night and rode out to Gaidghat on the Magura-Jessore road. They waylaid Wazed Molla, who was also riding in a motorcycle on the road, and snatched cash and his motorcycle from him. The hijackers, joined by a third of their accomplices, then tried to escape towards Magura, riding the two motorcycles. The victims, Wazed Molla, immediately alerted his acquaintances at Jagla along the road to Magura and told them about the mugging. Residents of Jagla village put up barricades on the road, got hold of the fleeing hijackers and beat them to death. Wazed Molla lodged a case with Magura sadar police station in this connection. The bodies of the three miscreants are kept in the police station. bdn
