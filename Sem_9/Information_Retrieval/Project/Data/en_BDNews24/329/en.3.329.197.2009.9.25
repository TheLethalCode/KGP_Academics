 Pabna, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami are still trying to raise Islamist militants by abusing religious sentiments, the state minister for home has alleged. "They have to be resisted by united efforts," Shamsul Haque Tuku said on Friday after visiting over 100 Durga Puja pavilions in Pabna. "The BNP-Jamaat-led alliance government created militants with the state patronage," he alleged. "Bangladesh is a country of religious harmony. Militancy will never be allowed to surface again in this beautiful country," Tuku said. The state minister visited the pavilions of Faridpur, Bhangura, Chatmohor, Atghoria, Ishwardy, Pabna Sadar, Suja Nagar, Bera and Santhia Upazila in Pabna. Local MP Makbul Hossain and Pabna superintendent of police Nibash Chandra Majhi, among others, accompanied the state minister during the visit. bdne
