 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Muslims in Bangladesh will celebrate the Eid-ul-Fitr on Monday. The public relations officer of Islamic Foundation S M Alauddin told bdnews24.com that the National Moon-Sighting Committee made the announcement during a meeting on Sunday evening. They sat at 7:30pm at the Islamic Foundation auditorium, with state minister for religious affairs Mohammed Shahjahan Miah in the chair. This will be the first time in many years that Bangladesh will officially be celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr after 29 days of fasting. In recent years, Ramadan has always been a 30-day month. The Eid now being on Monday will mean an uncomfortable break in the 11-day unofficial vacation, forcing offices to open on Wednesday and Thursday (Sept 23-24). The government declared public holiday on Sept 20, 21 and 22. The holiday would have been extended if Eid had fallen on Sept 22. Government offices will also be open on Sunday Sep 27, before another holiday for Durga Puja on Sep 28. Capital Dhaka will see a total of 361 Eid-ul-Fitr congregations this year, with thousands more around the country. Dhaka's largest gathering is scheduled for the National Eidgah Ground at the High Court premises. The main congregation, hosted by Dhaka City Corporation, will be held at 9am, with the Khatib of Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, Maulana Mohammad Salahuddin, leading the congregation. President Zillur Rahman, cabinet members, diplomats, political leaders and Muslims from all spheres will join the National Eidgah Ground gathering
