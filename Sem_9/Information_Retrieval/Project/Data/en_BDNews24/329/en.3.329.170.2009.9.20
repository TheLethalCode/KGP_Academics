<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 20 (bdnews24.com)Traffic congestion built up again in the capital on Sunday evening, though long suffering Dhaka residents enjoyed some respite from suffocating gridlock earlier in the day as many left the city for the holiday break. However, bumper-to-bumper trafficwhich has become such an unwelcome feature of the capital in the lead up to Eid-ul-Fitrreturned with the sighting of the Shawal moon. The new moon sighting, signalling Eid on Monday, led to last mad rush by city dwellers to complete shopping, errands and other preparations. All the city's main thoroughfares and shopping streetsfrom Airport Road across to Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Manik Mia Avenue to Mirpur Road, taking in Gulshan Avenue, Banani Road 11, Pantha Path and Elephant Roadbecame gridlocked from late evening. These same roads were wide open avenues just hours before. Amirul Islam, a resident of Mirpur-10, told bdnews24.com during the day, "The capital has really emptied, with few traffic jams or ear-splitting horns to contend with on the roads. If it would only last..." Islam said he reached the New Market area in only 20 minutes from his home that afternoon, where it had taken up to an hour-and-a-half in recent days and weeks. Syedul Islam Talat, a bdnews24.com correspondent, said he reached the High Court area from Mirpur Shewrapara in only 17 minutes at around midday, an unthinkable feat only a day before. "Usually it takes more than an hour to come to the High Court from Mirpur Shewrapara; the capital appears completely emptied ahead of the Eid festival," said Talat. Comparatively few vehicles were on the roads, although a good number of rickshaws were still plying the back streets, he said. b
