"The law enforcers including the police personnel have successfully and efficiently played their roles in maintaining law and order. They deserve praise for that," home minister Sahara Khatun said to reporters at the Secretariat on Wednesday, the first day after the vacation. She was questioned about the remarks of opposition chief Khaleda Zia on Monday that the government had failed to maintain law and order. Khatun said: "I don't want to comment on her remarks. She's a responsible person. "People are aware of the state of law and order. She should comment from practical perspective," the minister said. The law-enforcing agencies will also ensure security during the upcoming Durga Puja, she added. "There won't be any problem though there will be more Puja pavilions this year." "It will not do to wait only for government steps, people also should come forward to maintain law and order. "The responsibility is not only on the government alone. The law and order can be improved with concerted efforts," Khatun said.
