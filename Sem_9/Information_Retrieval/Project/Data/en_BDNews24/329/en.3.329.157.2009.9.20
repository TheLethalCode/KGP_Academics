 Cox's Bazaar, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)--Four forest department staff have been temporarily suspended on charges of abetting the illegal loggers in the felling of at least 30,000 Jhau (tamarisk) trees at Sabrang coast on Teknaf beach in Cox's Bazaar. Coastal Forest Department's assistant forest conservator MA Hasan told bdnews24.com that Teknaf forest range official Golam Mostafa, beat officer Manash Kumar Chakma, guard Abu Hanif Mojumder and the department's boatman Abdus Sabur were suspended on Friday. The prime minister's office, Coastal Forest Department and the Cox's Bazaar district administration have formed three committees to investigate the felling of the trees on the Teknaf beach, he said. Further actions will be taken against the temporarily suspended staff after the committees submit their findings. Leaders of the local chapter of ruling Awami League and its youth front Jubo League allegedly felled the trees at Katabunia, Kochubunia and Khorermukh of Sabrang union from Sept 5 to 10 to sell the land for construction of hotels and motels. Police, RAB and BDR in a joint drive recovered 7,000 felled trees on Sept 12. A forest official preferring not to be named told bdnews24.com that it is not possible for only three staff to guard the garden. "Those who felled trees have remained untouched, but we have become victims," he said. Deputy commissioner Giasuddin Ahmed, during a visit to the area on Wednesday, was told by locals that a group of people led by Teknaf Sabrang union Awami League president Jahed Hossain and his brother, Teknaf upazila Jubo League general secretary Noor Hossain, were involved in the crime. They had sold out the land at a high price, the locals alleged. But Hossain told reporters that "a group of influential people" were smearing them and also gave wrong information to the probe committees. He claimed that his brother, Noor, was also not involved in the felling of trees. bdnews2
