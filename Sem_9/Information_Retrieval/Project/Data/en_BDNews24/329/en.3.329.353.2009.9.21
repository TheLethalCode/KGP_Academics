<TITLE> World leaders called on to back global climate campaign </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)Citizens at over 2,400 events in 130 countries around the world on Monday will be calling their leaders to ask them to take action on climate change, for the Global Wake Up Call. Britain's top 100 business leaders and top 100 media personalities are also being asked to put their efforts and influence behind the global 'TckTckTck' climate change campaign. TckTckTck is a project of the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA). This new initiative involves national and global organisations in support of a single goal: to mobilise civil society and to galvanise public opinion to save the planet from dangerous levels of global warming. They are calling governments for a fair, ambitious and binding climate change agreement. People from the developed and developing world, from all walks of life, are gathering to sound the alarm in public places, with cell phones set to alarm, blasting favourite song, or even banging pots and pans. People everywhere, from Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro to French Polynesia to bus stops in Nigeria will sound alarms on their mobile phones, flood their governments with phone calls and make a tremendous noise at 12.18pm local time to push for action on climate change. The Global Wake Up Call kicked off in Asia on Monday, September 21, with hundreds of events across the continent, from Afghanistan to Japan. From Beijing to New York, thousands of people continue to join 'Wake-Up Call' events across the globe through the day urging their leaders to reignite stalled climate talks at the United Nations meeting on September 22. With just under 80 days to go before crunch climate change talks in Copenhagen, British Cabinet Ministers Ed Miliband, Lord Mandelson and Ben Bradshaw have pledged their support to the campaign. They have written to Britain's business and media leaders, and all MPs, asking them to back a global deal at December's Copenhagen climate summit. Kofi Annan, ex-Secretary General of the United Nations and leader of the campaign, recently wrote to 100 global leaders, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to ask them to join the campaign for an ambitious global climate deal. Just as he wrote to the global 'top 100', the UK Government is now passing on the message to the top 100 leaders in British business and media and is sending on a 'TckTckTck' badge as the symbol of the global campaign. The letter asks business and media leaders to write to their own 'top 100' telling them why they personally believe in tackling climate change, send them a badge and ask them to pass on the message to their own 'top 100'. Ed Miliband, Climate and Energy Secretary, who is attending climate change meetings in New York this week, said: "Governments have to show leadership to get the deal we need at Copenhagen. But we also need all parts of society to show it matters to them." He welcomes the TckTckTck campaign and will be pushing at every opportunity over the coming 80 days to get a deal Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary, said: "Britain's world-class businesses are global leaders in low carbon manufacturing. The TckTckTck campaign is an excellent catalyst for galvanising support from the sector and leading the way towards a low carbon economy."
