<TITLE> Safina plans 'choke-free' 2010 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While the computer tells Russia's Dinara Safina she is the leading player in women's tennis, the crushing pressure to win a grand slam title is sucking all the fun out of being world number one. A shock early exit from the US Open this month provided critics with further ammunition, but Safina insisted on Sunday her days of choking on the big stage were over. "It's sad what happened at the US Open," the 23-year-old told Reuters. "But it happened. I put too much pressure on myself and didn't let myself enjoy it. "I went back home and had five days off completely disconnected from tennis. I just had to step back a little bit. I'll be better next year." Safina said big brother Marat Safin had coaxed her through her trauma after she crashed out of the US Open to Czech teenager Petra Kvitova in the third round. "I speak with Marat a lot," said Safina, whose number one ranking was also mocked by Serena Williams after the American's Wimbledon triumph in July. "He became number one after winning a grand slam (the 2000 US Open) so it's a little bit different, but he says just enjoy yourself. "We're completely different. He left home when he was young to go to Spain, so maybe he's not used to having a younger sister with him 24 hours a day. "But if I have a problem he's the first person I turn to for help."

"I knew it was in my hands," said Safina in an interview organised by WTA Tour sponsors Sony Ericsson. "I was too pumped." Paris was followed by a 6-1, 6-0 mauling by Venus Williams in the Wimbledon semi-finals. But Safina, defending her Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo this week, predicted her grand slam breakthrough would come soon -- and could trigger a flood of major titles. "It will come," she said. "You could win a Grand Slam and you're not number one and they say 'why are you not number one?' But one of my goals was to reach number one and I did that." Safina added: "Now all my focus is on winning a grand slam. Once I win one I could go on and win many. It's happened to many players once they break through." Back at the lucrative $2 million Pan Pacific Open she dominated last year, Safina looked far more relaxed than the player who was hounded out of the US Open "I played the best tennis of my life in Tokyo last year," she said. "I just want to bring back my best tennis step by step." Her humour has also returned following her New York nightmare. "I went to Ginza but I didn't shop," said the multi-millionaire. "It's too expensive in To
