 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com)  The law minister, Shafique Ahmed, says the High Court verdict scrapping the Fifth Amendment is good enough to take Bangladesh back to its original constitution written in 1972. "There will be no need to amend the constitution (through an act of parliament)," the minister told reporters Sunday at his secretariat office. The High Court verdict, delivered on Aug 29, 2005, was challenged by the then BNP government, and the appellate division stayed the verdict after the petition. The minister dismissed suggestionfrom pro-BNP lawyers and politiciansthat the annulment of the Fifth meant restoring the Fourth that created the BKSAL government in January 1975. "A referendum annulled the Fourth Amendment," he pointed out. "There's no way of going back to the one-party system." Restoring the 1972 constitution, he said, would bring back the four basic principlesdemocracy, nationalism, secularism and socialismbased on which Bangladesh was created. "Even the parliament cannot promulgate martial law," he said, "how come martial law declared by one individual can change such fundamentals of the state  it's not logical to change the constitution through martial law ordinances. "The Constitution is the supreme law of the state, and it does not have provision for declaration of martial law." The newly-independent Bangladesh adopted its constitution in Nov 1972, and has since amended it 14 times, often responding to individuals' whims. Ziaur Rahman, the first military ruler, did away with secularism as he tried to lure Islamists to back his political ambition. Another authoritarian general, H M Ershad, introduced Islam as state religion. Shafique Ahmed, himself a lawyer, said the appeal hearing would soon be on the Supreme Court agenda. "There's the Bangabandhu Case high on the list, then the Jail Killing Case and then maybe this one," he told a questioner. But restoring the 1972 constitution is not the end of everything. "There are many issues in the constitution needing amendment. The government will take the initiative and place those for discussions in parliament." The Aug 29, 2005 High Court verdict also said all decisions, declarations and promulgations from Aug 15 1975 to 1979 restoration of parliament were unlawful and unconstitutional. All these decisions were taken by Khondokar Mushtaq Ahmed, who was installed by the coup leaders as head of state after they murdered the founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Abu Sadaat Mohammad Sayem, the then chief justice who officially acted as chief martial law administrator and head of state until major general Ziuar Rahman removed him from power, and the general himself. The High Court also said the changes of government between the Aug 15 murder and 1991 parliamentary elections had lacked legitimacy from the constitutional point of view. On Thursday, the minister said the Law Commission would soon be asked to work on necessary reforms of the constitution, a statement that drew criticism from BNP's Khondakar Delwar Hossain. Delwar said he saw "ulterior motive" in the minister's plans and that such changes to the constitution required a referendum. Shafique responded saying the commission did not legislate and that it was the job of the parliament. On the same day, another senior minister, Syed Ashraful Islam, said the AL government, despite its massive majority, would seek consensus while trying to reform the constitution. The law minister's comments on Sunday came after his meeting with the UNHCR representative in Dhaka. bdnews
