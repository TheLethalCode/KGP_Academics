 Dhaka Sep 22 (bdnews24.com)--The government hospitals are hamstrung by a crisis of on-duty physicians in the capital on Eid holidays, forcing patients to turn to private clinics. No patients other than emergency cases are coming in, with many going instead to private hospitals. Nargis Babu, 35, of Mirpur came to Dhaka Medical College Hospital with serious abdominal pain. He was told that no doctors, other than those in the emergency ward, were present during the Eid holidays and no specialist could be found until the holiday was over. He was finally admitted to a private hospital where specialists were available on call. Visits to the DMCH, Shahid Suhrawardy Hospital, Mitford Hospital, Dhaka Shishu Hospital revealed a similar tale. The specialist doctors at these hospitals are all on holiday along with a majority of the interns. There are a few doctors to handle emergencies but diagnostic facilities at these hospitals are also closed. Faruk Hossain, 42, a patient at the Suhrawardy Hospital, said no doctors came to the ward from the day before Eid. The nurses said the doctors can be called only on emergency. Abu Miraj Hossain, 30, from Mohammadpur, went to the DMCH with serious tonsil trouble on Eid morning, but he found no doctor. Finally after consulting a doctor of the hospital who runs a private clinic, his tonsils were operated on the night of Eid. The DMCH's on-duty doctor Anisur Rahman says that the pressure of patients are very low due to Eid. "We are providing them with adequate treatment. If it is necessary we can arrange for operations also. If the specialist doctors are contacted they will come." Suhrawardy Hospital's on-duty doctor Mushfiqur said that the majority of the patients are coming in with cases of stomach pains and upsets. Most of them return home after receiving treatment in the emergency ward. b
