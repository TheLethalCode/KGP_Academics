 WASHINGTON, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US State Department warned American citizens on Wednesday to be aware of a threat by al Qaeda that it would attack Germany around the time of its federal election on Sunday. "Al Qaeda recently released a video specifically warning Germany of attacks. German authorities are taking the threat seriously and have taken measures to enhance the level of security throughout the country," the State Department said in a travel alert that expires on November 11. "The Department of State urges US citizens to maintain good security practices at all times, and to maintain a heightened situational awareness and a low profile," it said. Germany stepped up security at airports and train stations last weekend due to the heightened risk of attack, fearing that militant groups could use the election as a stage for strikes to punish Germany for its troop deployment in Afghanistan. Of the five parties in Germany's Bundestag lower house of parliament, only the far-left "Linke" or Left Party is calling for an immediate troop pullout from Afghanistan. Unlike other European countries such as Britain or Spain, Germany, which has 4,200 troops in Afghanistan, has not experienced a major attack on home soil in recent years
