 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.coms correspondent Falun, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com) - Thousands of miles from home, it's the first time 21 year-old Md Shafiullah from Bangladesh is celebrating Eid away from his family. Muslim students from different countries observed Eid-ul-Fitrone of the world's major religious festivalsat Dalarna University in Sweden, along with others round the world, on Sunday. Shafiullah, studying at Dalarna, spoke to bdnews24.com, at Britsen student hostel in the Swedish city of Falun, about his first Eid abroad. "I am little feeling bit gloomy, but it is a new experience for me to celebrate Eid with different people from other countries with different customs." "And I know where I am and why I am here so I accept it, of course," he said. Shafiullah also conducted the hostel's Eid Jamaat, the main prayers of the special day, as Imam. "It's the first time I did it. I have no past experience," he said. After the Jamaat, Munajat was held in three languages - Bangla, English and Urdu. The Muslim students in Falun and Borlange are mainly from Bangladesh, Pakistan and some African countries. Most of them are studying at Dalarna University. About 50 students attended the Eid Jamaat at the Falun student hostel, while other students, including those of different faiths, came to see the Eid prayers. There was also a party arranged later at the hostel. Kamran Khan, a teacher from Pakistan and a graduate student at Dalana University, said, "This moment is very hard for me, that I am so far away from my homeland. I am unable to express my feelings." "But, during the Jamaat, we met others from different countries. And that was really a auspicious moment, to celebrate Eid with them," Kamran said. There was also a larger Eid Jamaat in the adjacent city of Borlange, attended by hundreds of students and Swedish Muslims. Fahmid Islam, a Bangladeshi student, said, "It was a unique experience to celebrate Eid overseas without family and close friends, mixed feelings of sadness and joy." Md. Jawad Khan, a social worker from Pakistan, told bdnews24.com, "I have been here for the last one month. I am missing my children and other family members very much." "I am feeling that I have lost something. But I am with other friends who are in the same situation. We are sharing our feelings with one another." And that, most would say, is what Eid is about. Eid-ul-Fitr literally means the festival after the fast. But for the millions of Muslims celebrating the occasion around the world on Sunday, the main message of Eid lies in sharing the experience with others.
