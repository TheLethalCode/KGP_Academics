<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)The government is training a corps of 62,000 volunteers for rescue and disaster mitigation operations in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet cities in case earthquakes wreak havoc, a minister has said. Disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq told reporters in his office on Wednesday that work on identifying the buildings 'at risk' in these cities was also underway. Similar training programmes will be launched soon for carrying out rescue and relief activities in other big towns also, he added. He answered to media queries about the governmental preparations as earthquakes shook Dhaka and the rest of the country on Monday and Tuesday. No equipment discovered so far can predict earthquakes exactly, which makes taking preparations ahead a seemingly impossible task, said the minister. Therefore, he said, the government is aiming at attempting effective measures to minimise post-disaster damages and people's sufferings instead. Appropriate equipment including 90-metre ladders and laser concrete cutters are also being procured under a Tk 69 crore project undertaken by the government, according to Razzaq. The minister said, some more projects are underway, which the prime minister has specially directed to be implemented, to cover the shortfalls in preparation. Coping mechanisms are being urgently considered in the disaster mitigation sector. The minister said what is most urgently needed is a well-concerted coordination framework which will tell different ministries and agencies involved in developing building designs, approval and implementation processes so that earthquakeresistant buildings are designed, approved and built, ensuring minimal damages in the future. The ramshackle old structures also need to be studied closely and urgently so that they could either be pulled down and rebuilt or repaired adequately to survive such calamities, he said. b
