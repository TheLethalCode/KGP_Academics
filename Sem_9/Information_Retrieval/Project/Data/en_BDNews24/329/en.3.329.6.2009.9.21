 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)--Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has said people are facing difficulties in celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr and will launch street agitations if there is no change in the price hike of essentials and deterioration of law and order. "People are observing Eid today in hardship. They have had to face suffering because of the high price of commodities and deterioration of law and order during the month of Ramadan," Khaleda told reporters after exchanging Eid greetings with people at Ladies Club in Eskatan Garden on Monday. "This government has already passed nine months. [It] could not implement the election pledges yet. People will be compelled to go for movement if the government cannot change the situation," she said. The former prime minister asked the government to take proper measures to address the issues. The opposition BNP chief said people doing jobs are facing harassment and ask the government to stop it. "The government should be more attentive to generate employment instead of making [people] jobless." The BNP chairperson said they are now working to reforming the party. "We will hold council in December," she said. Earlier, she exchanged greetings with foreign envoys at around 12:30pm. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee members R A Gani, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, Mahbubur Rahman and former foreign minister M Morshed Khan were present there. She then met with party activists and common people from 12:45pm to 2pm. The visitors were entertained with sweets, vermicelli and fruits. Khaleda went to her late husband Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla nagar and offered prayers there. b
