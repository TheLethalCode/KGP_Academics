<TITLE> Trezeguet snatches late draw for Juve </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENOA, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A header by substitute David Trezeguet four minutes from time gave Juventus a battling 2-2 draw at Genoa in Serie A on Thursday. It was the first time Juve had failed to win in five matches this season but they still moved level at the top on 13 points with champions Inter Milan, who beat Napoli 3-1 on Wednesday. "It has been a great match. We've not been able to win but it's a good draw as it's difficult to win at Genoa," forward Trezeguet told Sky television. Juventus went ahead after six minutes when Mauro Camoranesi cleverly dummied Claudio Marchisio's pass and in-form striker Vincenzo Iaquinta rifled home from the edge of the box. Genoa, also unbeaten before Sunday's defeat by Chievo, hit back just after the half hour when Giandomenico Mesto outjumped left back Fabio Grosso to powerfully head home. Grosso then failed to stop a cross and halftime substitute Hernan Crespo glanced in to give the hosts the lead moments after Iaquinta had a header wrongly ruled out for offside. In a breathless end-to-end finish, Giorgio Chiellini thought he had grabbed Juventus an equaliser but this time the offside flag was correctly raised. Ciro Ferrara's men were not to be outdone, however, and Grosso redeemed himself when Genoa's defence was caught out by his flighted free kick and Chiellini headed across for Frenchman Trezeguet to nod the ball home. Juve, who dropped playmaker Sebastian Giovinco, had a few other chances with the recently off-colour Amauri heading wide. Last season's runners-up were again without the injured Diego and Alessandro Del Piero but Ferrara hopes they can be available for Sunday's home game with Bolo
