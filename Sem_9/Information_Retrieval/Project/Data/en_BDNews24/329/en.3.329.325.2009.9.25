 Chittagong, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)--A factional clash marred a public rally organised by Chittagong City Awami League president ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury near Shah Amanat Bridge on Friday, police said. The clash ensued as followers of local MP Akhtaruzzaman Babu allegedly vandalised the stage and hurled chairs and stones at the opponents, Karnaphuli police Shahabuddin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. Mohiuddin, also Chittagong mayor, and other leaders were on-stage at that time, he said. "We called the rally in a bid to incorporate five unions of Karnaphuli Upazila into Chittagong City Corporation," Mohiuddin said. Some supporters of Babu also chanted slogans before throwing chairs at the stage, according to him. A scuffle also broke out between two rival groups, Shahabuddin said and added the chase and counter-chase continued for about 15 minutes. Police charged the warring activists with baton to disperse them, leaving at least seven injured, he said Five policemen also were injured during the clash, Shahabuddin said The Awami League workers injured during the clash were identified as Islam Ahmed 40, Didarul Alam 32, Anu Miah 30, 'Yakub' 30, Shahidullah 28, Abdul Mabud 27 and 'Debraj', 29.
