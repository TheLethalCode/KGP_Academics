 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)--Amid protests and demonstrations by conservative Christians, nearly 3,000 Muslim men, women and children held Jumma prayers on the west lawn of the Capitol on Friday. The praryer, the first in recent memory, was intended to convey the message that "Islam is the religion of peace and not violence", organisers said. As the Muslim devotees knelt down, faint shouts of "Repent" from Christian protesters floated across the congregation, interrupting the prayers. Unfazed, Iman Abdul Malik thundered, "stop being so scared. You ain't done nothing wrong. Just do the work of Allah, and believe". His strong message was designed to lift the spirit of the devotees, who appeared to have been rattled by the recent media coverage of the arrests of some alleged Muslim extremists in the United States. "We wanted to bring people out to show you don't need to fear America," said Imam Ali Jaaber of New Jersey, the service's main organizer. At the same time, he said, he wanted to remind non-Muslims that "we are decent Muslims. We work; we pay taxes. We are Muslims who truly love this country." Across the street from the service, Christian protesters gathered with banners, crosses and anti-Islamic messages. One group, which stood next to a 10-foot-tall wooden cross and two giant wooden tablets depicting the Ten Commandments, was led by the Rev. Flip Benham of North Carolina. "I would suggest you convert to Christ!" Benham shouted over a megaphone. Islam "forces its dogma down your throat." A few Christian protesters gathered at the rear of the Muslim crowd, holding Bibles and praying. At one point, organisers asked them to tone it down. "We would never come to a prayer meeting that you have to make a disturbance," Hamad Chebli, imam of the Islamic Society of Central Jersey, said from the lectern. "Please show us some respect. This is a sacred moment. Just as your Sunday is sacred, our Friday is sacred." The noise from protesters faded somewhat during the final portion of the service, which lasted nearly two hours. Organisers said this month that they hoped to draw about 50,000 people from mosques across the country for the gathering, billed as a day of unity for the nation's Muslims. But it failed to attract the support of national Islamic organisations and drew only a fraction of that number. Some people were frightened off by the conservative Christian attacks, said Hassen Abdellah, president of Dar-ul-Islam. Nonetheless, organisers said they were happy with the turnout
