 Shehabuddin Kislu from New York New York, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday urged investors from everywhere to invest in Bangladesh and said her government will extend all support to encourage investment. She gave the call on Thursday evening in the presence of business people at a seminar organised in the hall room of Grand Hyatt New York. She called upon potential investors to consider Bangladesh as their next Asian investment destination as it offers low-cost labor, large domestic market and market access to nearly 3 billion people in Asia. Bangdesh's economy has remained somewhat insulated from the fallout of the global financial downturn that has ravaged even many developed economies. Hasina mentioned the envisaged improvement of the investment environment in the private sector, and the public-private-partnership (PPP) initiative will soon be brought under the PMO, which will enable it to work closely with the Board of Investment. Geographically, Bangladesh is today considered a country of immense possibilities, as its millions of youths have already created waves in the global labour market, she said. Highlighting the stupendous growth rates achieved by India and China in the recent past, Hasina said the two promising Asian giants expect to attain 50 percent more growth by 2050. Bangladesh hopes to fall successfully into their footsteps soon by introducing e-governance throughout and cutting in on internet expenditure by 75 percent. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the prime minister's son, also spoke at the talk sponsored by Trans-First, a US-based money transfer agency. JP Morgan, Citibank, Bear Stearns and other big business firms were represented at the seminar. bdnew
