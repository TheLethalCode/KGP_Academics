 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman along with the leaders from 23 other states joined the inaugural ceremony of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thual, Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday evening. Saudi King Abdullah presented the keynote address on the occasion of the grand opening of the KAUST held in an auditorium fitted with state-of-the-art technology. Abdullah said the KAUST will serve not only as an 'abode of learning' but also call out to the conflict and war-torn world of today to 'behave more temperately'. He recalled with reverence that the history of science and the 'golden era' of scientific research had been considerably enriched by the contributions of the ancient Arab civilisations and their researchers. After delivering his speech, the King ceremonially declared the university open by touching a touch-screen which kicked off a grand fireworks exposition. About 3,000 distinguished guests enjoyed the show which depicted through a number of select cultural activities the blossoming of an excellent centre of science and technology studies at the small fishing town of Thual. Fifty children carrying the flags of 50 nations who sent students to KAUST next rose onto the stage. High level delegations from Lebanon, USA, UAE, Pakistan, Algeria, Russia, India and France and other countries, including Bangladesh, were present on the occasion. b
