 LONDON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new Michael Jackson single called "This Is It" will hit the airwaves on October 12, two weeks before it is available as part of a two-disc album released by the late pop star's record label.

The second disc will include unreleased versions of some of the singer's classic tracks and a spoken word poem entitled "Planet Earth" performed by Jackson and never heard before.
