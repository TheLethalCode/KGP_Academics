 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  Dejected after the six-wicket loss to England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara deprecated the wicket at the New Wanderers Stadium, saying that the track was not good enough for a one-day match, reports PTI. Sri Lanka struggled to 212 all out as England pacers exploited the seamer-friendly pitch to steer their side to an advantageous position on Friday. "The wicket was not the best for one-day cricket specially when you want to attract fans. It was not a typical one-day track. It looked like first day of a Test match," a disappointed Sangakkara said after the match. "Still it's up to us to perform in different conditions," he added. Despite being bundled out for a small total, the stumper batsman extolled his batsmen, who he said put up a brave fight. "It was a good total. From where we were, to build 212 was fantastic.

Probably we were one seamer short but spin has always been our main strength so we will always rely on them," Sangakkara said. Winning captain Andrew Strauss was a happy man but cautioned the team against dropping its guard in the coming matches. "We played well. Did well with the new ball. The key was not to lose too many wickets, play sensibly and avoid rash shots. Paul Collingwood played great, Owais Shah played an important innings and Eoin Morgan was excellent," he said. "I am very pleased with the win and it was a very professional chase. I am delighted but there is more hard work to do," he added. Collingwood, chosen man-of-the-match for his excellent 46-run knock, said aggression was key to his performance on Friday. "When you contribute to team's win, it's great feeling. Today's was a great team performance. The chase was difficult and aggressive batting helped. Morgan played well and wicket also suited our bowlers," he
