 Mohsinul Karim bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to develop four satellite towns surrounding the capital to ease the housing crisis and pressure on utilities on the capital. The four towns, each equipped with one 100,000 accommodation facility, will be implemented under public-private partnership initiative, state minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan said in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com. Discussion is already on at the government's top level while his ministry has begun buying lands for the project, Mannan said. The areas where there is plenty of government-owned land would be given priority, the minister said "The government has initiated some more projects afresh. The proposed towns will be developed beyond the purview of Detailed Area Plan (DAT) of RAJUK," he said Each town sprawled over 500 acres of land will feature some 20 multi-storied buildings, each with 40-80 flats, he said. Each town is supposed to have one lakh flats. "The proposed satellite towns would be equipped with their own internal solar system, rainwater reservoir and security system so that the government does not have to provide additional power, water and security for the dwellers." The minister declined to elaborate on the project lest earlier announcement might cause the land price for the proposed site to soar. "It might pose a threat to the prospect of the projects." He further said the government wanted to complete the project before it runs its term and added that it will hand the lands over to the domestic and foreign investors in line with terms of the contract. Government flats might be sold on 'hire-purchase scheme' and government employees will get priority, he said. However, common people will have the opportunity to purchase the flats and developers will have to sell out the flats at prices fixed by the government, Mannan said. Asked if they had found any interested foreign organisation, the minister said local housing business body REHAB has already offered to invest in the projects. On top of that, investors from Korea, Malaysia and Switzerland have responded. Currently, around 150 million people live in Dhaka where accommodation facilities have not matched growing demand. Only seven percent of the civil servants, based in Dhaka, enjoy government accommodation while the rest live on their own. bdnews24.
