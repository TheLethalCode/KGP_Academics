 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)--Traders who stocked up vegetables to sell them at runaway prices, presuming the Eid will fall on Tuesday, are failing to get buyers at throwaway prices on poor demand a day after Eid at Karwan Bazaar. The sellers at the capital's biggest wholesale kitchen market said on Tuesday they faced huge losses despite offering goods, in some cases, at one-fifth of the previous prices. Alal Miah, a cucumber trader, told bdnews24.com he could sell cucumbers worth only Tk 1,700 of the total product worth Tk 80,000 including transportation cost. "Nobody is now buying cucumber even at Tk 2-3 a kg," he said. A sobbing Miah said he would be happy to offset the transportation cost worth Tk 10,000. He bought one maund of cucumber at Tk 700-- a kg costing him Tk 17-- thinking that the Eid-ul-Fitr would fall on Tuesday. Two days earlier, he sold cabbage at Tk 6,000 that he bought at Tk 22,000. "I'm now penniless after investing all my money in cabbage and cucumber," said Alal, barely able to control tears. The lady's finger was sold for Tk 20 a day before Eid, but now there were hardly any buyers even for Tk 4-5 a kg. Things are similar with potato and gourd. Traders are now willing to sell gourd at one-fifth of the previous price, which was Tk 20. Another trader, Mukhlesur Rahman said: "We cannot sit idle with the perishable goods. They should be sold out at any rate." Bean seller Jainal Abedin said he had previously sold them at Tk 30 per kg, but there was no-one around to buy them at Tk 10. A cabbage is now being sold at Tk 4/5 from the earlier price of Tk 20. Many trucks laden with goods were seen waiting for buyers in the market. Mohammed Babul, a seller of coriander leaf, told this correspondent: "Take all of them. You don't need to pay me any money." Prices of other vegetables such as potato, papaya, cucurbetacuous plant, arum and green banana have also slipped by Tk 5/6a kg. bdne
