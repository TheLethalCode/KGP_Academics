 Kishoregonj, Sep 21 (bdnews24.com)Like every year, Sholakia hosted the largest Eid congregation of the country on Monday. The congregation started at 11am at the Eidgah ground with around 2,00,000 Muslims who defied heavy rains and thunder. Maolana Farid Uddin Masud, chairman of the Islahul Muslimin Parishad, led the prayers. Three gunshots were fired thrice before 15 minutes, twice before five and once before one minute to the start of the congregation to draw the attention of the devotees. Hundreds of people from far and wide started flocking to the ground spanning over seven acres of land overnight. RAB and police were deployed at the Eidgah and its adjacent areas to maintain security. One of the oldest surviving congregation grounds in Bangladesh, established in 1828, the Sholakia Eidgah reportedly held 1.25 lakh people at its first congregation. bdnews2
