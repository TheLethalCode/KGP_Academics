 Dhaka, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com)Election Commission will propose provisions for funding election expenditures of the political parties from the government exchequer. Recommendations will be made on providing political parties with polls expenses from a 'Test Fund' to ensure transparency and to keep the elections free from the influence of black money, election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain has said. He said it might cost around Tk 100 crore to meet the expenses of voting campaigns of the registered political parties. Discussions would be held with the political parties before making any decision on the proposal, he said. Shakhawat said that the EC would hold dialogues with the registered political parties to bring some amendments to the election laws (RPO) while preparation for making a 'working paper' is underway. He said the EC is likely to hold talks with the political parties by December. Apart from political parties, civil society representatives, different professionals, including media personalities, will be consulted before forwarding a final recommendation to the government on the amendment proposals, he said. Shakhawat said that there could be provisions for meeting election expenditures of political parties from the public exchequer in proportion to their representation in the parliament, total votes obtained in the election and other considerations. The proposals will be made on the basis of the opinions of the political parties, he said. The EC is capable of monitoring polls expenditure as it is equipped with required manpower for doing this. According to Shakhawat, a specific regulation could be formulated based on the opinions of all, if the EC is to shoulder the expenses of projection meetings and campaign posters of the political parties. The government will allot required funds in line with the regulations, he said. Some 39 political parties had registered with the EC prior to the ninth parliamentary election in Dec 2008. As per the electoral law, each political party is allowed to spend as much as Tk 1.5 lakh per candidate in a single constituency while the provision allows each candidate to spend a maximum of Tk 15 lakh for the hustings. Though political parties submit reports on the polls expenditure to the EC after the election, the real expense figures would be much higher. bd
