 Dhaka, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com)Devotees prayed to Goddess Durga to purge them of all distress on the 'Mahashaptami' on Friday, the second day of the five-day celebrations. 'Mahaoshtami', on Saturday, will begin with 'Bihit Puja' in the morning and will end by 'Shandhi Puja' in the evening. Ramkrishna Mission will hold 'Kumari Puja' to observe the rituals. Manik Bhattacharjee, priest at the Kalabagan Puja pavilion, told bdnews24.com, "Goddess Durga is established in a new form on Shaptami. She enters 'Naba Patrika', her father's house from the in-law's, this day and returns on Vijaya Dashami (the last day). The first Puja includes invitation, prayers and demands to the goddess, he added. The pavilions around the city were festive in colourful lighting and people from all religions with colourful dresses were enjoying the Puja festivities. The rituals will end on Monday, 'Vijaya Dashami', when devotees bid Durga a tearful goodbye and invite her to return next year. bdn
