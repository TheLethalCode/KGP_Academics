 Syed Nahas Pasha, UK correspondent London, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)--Former Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil was assaulted by UK Juba League workers on Thursday, a day after he launched a scathing attack on Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina in an interview with bdnews24.com. Jalil, on a private visit to the UK, came under attack in Birmingham in the afternoon when he had gone there to open a money transfer agency and attend a reception. Some 10-12 activists of the AL's youth front assaulted him after the AL advisory council member had got down from his car to open the money exchange of Mercantile Bank at Coventry Road, witnesses said. Those accompanying Jalil, also the chairman of the bank, whisked him away into the money exchange office. The Juba League workers then went away chanting slogans. In the interview, he said that he had made a mistake by not going against Hasina on his return to the country to protect his post during the 2007-08 caretaker government regime. "It was my mistake not to go against her. My offence was extreme loyalty to her," Jalil said on Wednesday. ( Read the story Not fighting Hasina was a mistake: Jalil bd
