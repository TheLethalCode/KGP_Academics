 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com) A Supreme Court lawyer on Sunday slapped legal notices on 16 city hospitalsincluding top ones like Apollo, United and Squarefor allegedly charging Value Added Tax (VAT) from patients violating a High Court order. The lawyer, Manjil Morshed, told bdnews24.com he would sue these hospitals for contempt of the court if they did not stop in the next three days. The list of "culprits" included City Hospital, Compath Ltd, Modern Diagnostic Center, Popular, Shomorita, Medinova, LabAid, Central, Delta, Brighton, Comfort, Monowara and Ibn Sina. A High Court order on Jul 14 declared it 'unlawful' and a violation of the constitution if the service providers charge VAT on fees for consultation, pathological and other diagnostic tests. The court order came in response to a writ petition filed on Feb 15 by three citizens Julhas Uddin Ahammad, Md Abdul Bari and Golam Mostafa. Sunday's legal notice said the High Court order had been covered well by the media, but only a few hospitals and diagnostic centers bothered to comply. bdn
