<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)A solo painting exhibition of pre-eminent artist and freedom fighter Shahabuddin Ahmed, titled 'Jai Bangla' kicks off Sunday. Indian actress and social worker Shabana Azmi is scheduled to inaugurate the exhibition while finance minister A M A Muhith would be the chief guest at the ceremony to be held at the city's Bengal Gallery, say the organisers. At a news conference on Saturday Subir Chowdury, director of Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, said the French ambassador, Charley Causeret, would be also present as the special guest. Over the last three decades, Shahabuddin has been showing his remarkable works extensively around the world. His distinctive style, depicting a blend of Oriental and Occidental art forma, made him a prominent name among European art lovers. Shahabuddin's mastery led him to receive the honour of being one of the "50 Master Painters of Contemporary Arts" at the Olympiad of Arts, Barcelona in 1992. Born in 1950, Shahabuddin, a company commander in the nation's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 , graduated from then Bangladesh College of Arts and Crafts before going to Paris for higher studies with a scholarship by the French government. "I still feel lucky that I was the one to hoist the [national] flag on the 16th [Dec, 1971] at the Bangladesh Betar premises," he said at the news conference. After a break of nine years, the painter came back to his beloved city with 32 of his works, with most of the paintings focused on the theme of liberation. Asked about the long-break, Shahabuddin said he was shocked to see the nation's flag on the cars of those who were against the liberation. "It was a protest from me." The painter stressed the need of more and more art exhibitions to support the artist community of the country and thanked the sponsors, the Hong Kong Shanghai Corporation (HSBC) Bangladesh, for the initiative. "Most of the painters [of Bangladesh] do very well in the early stages, but afterwards they can't as the support, financial or other, is not there," he said.
