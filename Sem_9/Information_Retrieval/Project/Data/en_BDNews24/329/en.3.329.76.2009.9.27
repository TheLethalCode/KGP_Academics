 Dhaka, Sep 27(bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina turns 62 Monday and will spend her birthday, her friends say, with her "full family" for the first time in many years. The prime minister, now in New York, will fly to Washington early on the day to be with her son Sajib Wajed Joy, who lives in Baltimore, Washington. Daughter Saima Wajed Putul, who lives in Canada, will also join them, so may their cousinschildren of Sheikh Rehana, who is travelling with the prime minister. By Monday morning New York time, Hasina will have wound up her hectic, high profile six-day visit to the UN, where she addressed the UNGA, met and dined with Barack Obama, Ban Ki Moon and Hilary Clinton. This will be her first birthday after the death of her husband M A Wajed Miah. Born on Sep 28, 1947 to independence hero Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Fajilatunnesa, at Tungipara in Gopalganj, Hasina lost her parents and all her siblings but younger sister Rehana on Aug 15, 1975. The two sisters escaped the brutal assassination as they were abroad at that time. She returned to her homeland in 1981 and has since survived several attempts on her life, the most notable one being the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack in downtown Dhaka. bd
