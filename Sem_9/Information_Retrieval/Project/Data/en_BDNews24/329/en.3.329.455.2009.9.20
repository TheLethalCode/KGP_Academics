<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 20 (bdnews24.com)Shopkeepers haggled with customers in a last-minute bid to sell out their products on the last day of Eid shopping in the city on Sunday. There was a brisk business at the city's most popular market places for the low and middle-income peoplelike the New Market and Gausia Market -- where the crowds still thronged to get their hands on apparels, jewellery, cosmetics and shoes. Customers and traders at Gausia, a popular market for its variety of dress, ornaments, cosmetics and shoe collection for women, were fiercely bargaining about anything and everything. Hashim Sheikh, a cosmetics seller, told bdnews24.com, "This is the last day and we don't want to lose a single customer. We're selling products at a lower price than we are in the last few days." "Shoppers are coming to our market braving the scorcing sun and intermittent heat and we expect larger crowd in the afternoon until well after midnight," he added. The streets and pavements were in a mess around Gausia, where the law-enforcers were having a field day trying to control the traffic and crowd. There was also a good number of community police helping the law-enforcers. Arshad Alam, assistant sub-inspector of New Market Police Station, was guiding the constables from a temporary police camp near the over-bridge at Gausia-Mirpur Road point. Alam said, "We're on special duty to ensure security of the shoppers and make their shopping easy and comfortable." No unpleasant incident was reported, he said. People thronged the New Market to buy cloths and fancy items. The adjacent kitchen market was also overcrowded with customers. Traffic on the VIP roads were moving easy and fast, thanks to their fewer numbers, but heavy pressure was found on the Mirpur Road near Elephant Road and Gausia market. On Sunday, shoppers were fewer at Elephant Road markets, another popular shopping area in the city. Eastern Plaza and Bashundhara City were also having a lot of customers at noon on Sunday. Abul Kalam, owner of a cosmetics shop at Bashundhara city, told bdnews24.com, "Sales have fallen significantly today. It might increase in the afternoon." "But most of the shoppers, going outside Dhaka, have already done their bit," Kalam added. Mobile-phone sets and fancy items were selling fast, while there were fewer customers for dresses and shoes. Hasibul Islam, a customer in the mall said, "I've come here to buy some different kinds of products, but the prices are too high." Kamrul Islam, branch manager of a brand shop for men's wear, told bdnews24.com, "Sales are satisfactory, although a little lower than the previous days. But we've some regular customers who always buy brand products." Traders at the Rifles Square also spoke of a low sales on the last day before Eid, whereas the posh fashion items and gold jewellery were still selling in a faster pace. Busy essentials market Prices of vegetables, fish and meat were found in a fluctuation on the eve of Eid day. Price of broiler chicken increased by Tk 5 and mutton by Tk 20-50 per kg. Beef was being sold in haggled price due to its low demand. Talking about the price hike, Bacchu Mia, a mutton seller, told bdnews24.com, "The supply is very low. Moreover, after the 25th Ramadan, government doesn't control prices." Shahid, a seller of beef, said, "We're selling beef at a lower rate as the demand has fallen." "Sales of fishes have also reduced and their prices as well" Karim, a fish trader in the market said. The shoppers were looking for fruits and sweets on the eve of the Eid day to serve the guests, which led to a significant rise in demand and thus the traders were seen asking for exorbitant prices, Rabiul Islam, a customer, told bdnews24.com. On the contrary, the chain shops were having huge crowds all over the day, where customers can buy all necessary items in a hassle-free environment.
