<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)-Bangladesh wants to work as a peace-builder apart from peace-keeper across the world, prime minister Sheikh Hasina will tell US president Barack Obama during a meeting on Wednesday. Foreign minister Dipu Moni in an interview with BBC Radio Bangla Service on Wednesday said the prime minister would deliver the message in talks with leaders of countries contributing UN peacekeeping troops around the world, hosted by Obama. Bangladesh is a leading contributor to the peacekeeping missions, with around 10,000 personnel from the country engaged in different missions around the world. Asked whether Bangladesh would place any proposal at the talks, Moni said: "You know that last time we were organisers of a resolution 'The Culture of Peace' and 124 countries consulted with each other on that." "We want to work not only as peace keepers in different countries, we also want to work all over the world as peace builders," she said. "We want to work accordingly in our whole region." She said Dhaka wants recognition of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support Operation as a regional peace-keeping training institute. The foreign minister said UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had proposed Bangladesh sending women to peacekeeping missions. "We are considering the matter," the foreign minister said. "Since we send nearly the highest number of peace-keepers we want the command of peace-keepers. "We want our people who are now at the commanding positions go further up in leading positions," Moni said. "We have some proposals like our people who work in the administrative sector should work in better positions." Asked why the US president is holding the talks, though peacekeeping is a UN concern, the minister said: "This is definitely a matter of UN." "You know many countries lead in holding talks on many UN issues. President Barack Obama has given the invitation accordingly." On why the meeting is being held, she said: "Barack Obama is holding talks with countries that provide the highest number of peacekeeping forces to the UN mission." "We are the second highest contributors as military peacekeepers and hold the top position as police peacekeepers." Other issues such as how the mission could work better and the problems and challenges faced by the peacekeepers would be discussed at the talks, she said. bdne
