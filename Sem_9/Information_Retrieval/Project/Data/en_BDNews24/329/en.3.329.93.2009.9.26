 Dhaka, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)An alleged gangster was killed in a so-called 'gun battle' with the police in Dhaka's Mirpur early on Saturday. 'Johnny' alias 'Pathan Johnny', 28, was a member of 'Bikash terror gang', the police claimed. Al Amin, 30, an associate of the slain gangster, was arrested, while two others escaped. Mirpur police chief Mohammad Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com that the criminals were roaming Kallyanpur in a white private car. Police asked them to stop, but they turned back. Police chased and stopped them at Balur Math (playground) but were greeted with bullets. The law-enforcers also retaliated and Johnny was killed on the spot. "We guess they were plotting a major terrorist operation," Hossain added. Police retrieved a revolver, three rounds of bullets and two bullet shells from the spot. bdnews
