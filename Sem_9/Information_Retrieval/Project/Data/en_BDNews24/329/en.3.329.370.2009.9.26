<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com) A bushranger was killed early on Saturday in what police described as crossfire during a gunfight in the Sundarbans. Police said Fasiar Rahman Shanu, 42, was bullet wounded during the firefight with them near Nandabala canal of the Chandpai range of the eastern division of the Sundarbans. Shanu was rushed to Mongla Hospital but doctors declared him dead. Kazi Jalal Uddin Ahmed, officer-in-charge of Mongla Police Station, said they chased a group of five or six dacoits in the area on information that they were preparing for robbery. But the suspected robbers led by Shanu opened fire at them sensing their presence. The security officials retaliated, and after nearly half-an-hour of fight they found the bullet-wounded body of Shanu near the canal. The officials also recovered a locally-made gun, nine bullets and six jackets from the scene. Shanu, a resident of Khunkarer Ber village of the Mithakhali union, was known as the head of a group of bushrangers who extort money from fishermen and Bawalis (honey collectors). There are charges of murder and possession of illegal arms against Shanu, police said. Meanwhile, police arrested three members of banned Purbo Banglar Communist Party (ML Janajuddho) in separate raids in the district Friday night. They are Azim Sheikh, 38; Masud Sheikh, 32 and Sohag Haoladar, 24. Police are interrogating them. bdnews
