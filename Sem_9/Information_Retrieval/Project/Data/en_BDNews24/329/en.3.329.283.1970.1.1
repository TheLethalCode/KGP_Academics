 KABUL, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five US troops were killed in three separate incidents in southern Afghanistan, the military said on Friday. Two were killed and a third died of wounds sustained from a roadside bomb attack, the military said in a statement. The fourth and fifth died of wounds sustained during insurgent attacks. All three attacks took place on Thursday. The eight-year-old war in Afghanistan has been in its deadliest phase for foreign troops since July, when US and British forces launched the biggest offensives of the war. There are now more than 100,000 Western troops in Afghanistan, about two-thirds of them American. Their commander, U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal, is expected to ask for thousands more in a request he will deliver to Washington this week. He has said that without additional forces, his mission is likely to fail.
