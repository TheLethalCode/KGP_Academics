 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)Law-enforcers on Sunday said they have gone the extra mile to ensure security of the main Eid congregation at National Eidgah Ground, with Dhaka Metropolitan Police establishing a temporary control room and RAB conducting a thorough sweep of the area. "We have taken all precautions to ensure no untoward events occur at the main Eid congregation," DMP commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque told reporters at the National Eidgah Ground. DMP have installed 12 close-circuit cameras around the High Court grounds, where the main Eid congregation will gather, as well as establishing a control room as a base for police and Rapid Action Battalion officials. Commissioner Haque said a huge uniformed police deployment with plainclothes units would be at the High Court grounds during the congregation. Metropolitan deputy commissioner Monirul Islam told bdnews24.com a new 'lost and found' cell would also be operating out of the control room this year. "More than 1,000 police, including plainclothes officers and women detachments, will be working on the day," said Islam. Meanwhile, RAB officials conducted a thorough search of the Eidgah ground with metal detectors and sniffer dogs, officials said. "Some 15-20 members of the elite force will be posted at each gate to the grounds, both in uniform and plainclothes," RAB-3 deputy director Khalid Shams told bdnews24.com. He said six RAB pickup vehicles and 12 motor cycles would also patrol the area.
