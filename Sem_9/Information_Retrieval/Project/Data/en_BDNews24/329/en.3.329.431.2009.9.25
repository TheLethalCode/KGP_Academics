 Dhaka, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com)--US president Barack Obama has acclaimed contribution of Bangladesh in UN peacekeeping mission, terming it a shining example to be followed. New York-based journalist Abu Taher said Obama gave assurance of all possible assistance to Bangladesh in combating challenges ahead at a meeting with heads of top ten troops-sending countries to the UN peacekeeping missions. He hosted the meeting in New York on Wednesday (Thursday Dhaka time), Taher added. Obama said the necessity of UN peace mission was beyond question and he remembered with gratitude the contribution of top ten countries including Bangladesh. He said the need of peace mission to ensure security of the helpless people across the globe would never expire. The president stressed the need for training for the participants in peace mission. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina first spoke for Bangladesh at the meeting. Pointing to president Obama, Hasina said Bangladesh wanted to contribute not only in peace mission but also in establishing global peace. She said, a total of 92 Bangladeshis sacrificed their lives while working as peace keepers in different parts of the globe with some 102 getting injured. Until now, Bangladesh has participated in 63 peace missions. The prime minister said many countries abandoned the mission for fear of danger but Bangladesh did not. Sierra Leone has accorded Bangla the status of second state language out of gratitude to Bangladeshis. Many roads and avenues in that African nation have been named after Bangladesh which bears testimony to the success of Bangladesh, Hasina said. Stressing the need for training for the peacekeepers, Hasina called for a institute on peacekeeping mission established in Bangladesh to be recognised as UN-sponsored peace keepers' training institution. Hasina attended a reception extended by Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. US president hosts such reception every year in honour of heads of different state coming from across the globe. Reception Prime minister Hasina and foreign minister Dipu Moni are expected to attend a reception hosted by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in honour of female heads of state and government and foreign ministers. The Awami League's US chapter is set to celebrate the success of the government on Saturday, while the BNP's unit is also ready to stage anti-government demonstrations on the same day in front of United Nations headquarters
