 Chittagong, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)-- A few hundred workers of Chittagong city unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League on Saturday burnt an effigy of Chittagong City Awami League president ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. They protested his meeting with BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, who is facing war crimes charges, last week. The BCL workers, known to be followers of Awami League leader Azam Nasir, also burnt an effigy of BNP leader Salauddin. They earlier brought out a procession that started from Andarkilla and marched down the streets before coming to a stop at Chittagong Press Club square where a brief rally was also held and the effigies were burnt down. Chittagong City Awami League leader Nazrul Islam presided over the rally. Former BCL leaders Nazmul Haque Duke, Hasan Murad Biplob, who was the vice-president of Chittagong Commerce College, among others, spoke at the rally. Earlier on Thursday, a section of Chittagong City Awami League unit demanded expulsion of Mohiuddin, also the city mayor, for the same reason. Salauddin on last Tuesday held a closed-door meeting with Mohiuddin at the latter's residence. Chittagong City Corporation officials and Awami League leaders, who were present there, said it was a courtesy meeting where they exchanged Eid greetings. Asked about this, Mohiuddin said on Saturday "He is my nephew. His father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury was my first cousin. So it is a family issue." Many things are to be managed to do politics,he also said. "He came to my house at my invitation. There is no reason to look at it from political angle. Apart from me, other members of my family also talked with him." "Apart from the day after Eid, we also met at various religious ceremonies, including marriage, and talk with each other." Asked about the demand for his expulsion, he said, "They can as well ask for it. It is their democratic right." "It is up to the central committe, not me, to see how much logic is their in their demand." . bd
