<TITLE> Back to work on Wednesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  It's back to work for most people on Wednesday as government and private offices, along with banks, will open again after the three-day Eid holiday. A previous order that said offices may remain closed on Wednesday is no more effective since Eid-ul-Fitr day fell on Monday. This year, the official Eid holiday was just three days, following four-day vacations over the last three consecutive years. The holiday began from Sept 20, though most office-goers got a five-day vacation including the previous Fri-Sat weekend. Others, who took the trouble to travel to home districts for the festival, are likely to have an even lengthier vacation, taking extra leave on Wednesday and Thursday followed by the coming weekend. Normal 9am-5pm office timings will resume from Wednesday after a curtailed 9am-4pm working day during Ramadan. Another public holiday is due for Durga Puja at the start of next week. bdne
