<TEXT>
 Kushtia, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)A top-ranking extremist was killed in a shootout during a joint operation of RAB and police early on Saturday in Doulatpur in the suburb of Kushtia town. Mohon, 42, member of the banned Purbo Bangla Communist Party (ML) 'red flag', was the 19th victim of the ongoing crackdown against outlawed extremists in the country's south and south-western districts. Squad commander of RAB-12 Kushtia unit Flight Lt Nazrul Islam said, "Acting on a tip-off that a gang of terrorists had assembled for a secret meeting near Trimohoni Bazar in Lalnagar village under Doulatpur Upazila, a RAB contingent raided the spot at around 3:15am. "The miscreants opened fire on RAB and police forces and the law enforcers retaliated, ensuing a gun battle," he said. Mohon's body was found after the gun battle, while his accomplices flee from the scene, Islam added. The officer said police retrieved a pipe gun, four rounds of ammunition, three hand bombs and two local weapons from the spot. Officer-in-charge of Doulatpur Police Station Hassan Hafizur Rahman said Mohon faced five murder cases filed against him with Doulatpur and Bheramara Police Stations. A special crackdown of the law enforcing agencies to curb militancy in the south and south-western regions is ongoing. State minister for home Shamsul Islam Tuku said the militants have been asked to surrender or the drive against them would be intensified further. Human-rights organisation 'Odhikar' said 19 people were killed in the country in August in so-called 'crossfire, encounter or gunfight', of whom 10 were members of various banned militant outfits. It said 322 people were killed in last two years during the army-backed caretaker regime led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". RAB said 577 people died in 472 shootout incidents up to Aug 31 since the special force was raised on March 26, 2004. Human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. Home minister Sahara Khatun, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. Tuku has denied allegations by human-rights organizations, saying, "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting raids against terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who were responsible for such killings in custody or without custody. The shootouts are commonly reported as 'crossfire' by the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the army-backed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over the past years have repeatedly expressed concern over the extra-judicial killings in the country. Last May, HRW in a report suggested disbanding 'elite' security forces such like the Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). bdnews2
