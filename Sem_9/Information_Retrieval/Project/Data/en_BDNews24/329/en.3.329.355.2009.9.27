 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com)--The government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have signed an agreement to extend the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) development project by four years. The UNDP said in a statement on Sunday that the agreement would inject new force into the development of CHT region. The statement said the decision to extend the 'Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in the Chittagong Hill Tracts' project until Sep 2013 was based on the positive impacts of the current phase of the project which ends this month. The UNDP launched the development project in 2003. "UNDP is pleased to continue this successful multi-sectoral project to support the process of peace building that emanated from the signing of the Peace Accord," country director Stefan Priesner said. "This will be done through the immediate provision of multiple services to the people of CHT, whilst building the basis for long term sustainable development in the region." The ongoing project includes community empowerment, institutional capacity building, health, education, economic development and confidence building currently operating in 16 out of 25 upazilas of the CHT and benefiting more than 500,000 indigenous people and Bangalees in often remote locations. The extension will raise the project's budget from $50 million (approximately Tk 300 crore) to $160.5 million (approximately Tk 1100 crore). In addition to UNDP's own resources, funds will be made available by the European Commission, Canada (CIDA), Denmark (DANIDA), USA (USAID), Norway, Australia (AusAid) and Japan. Priesner said, "The support of a variety of major development partners for this project is a good example of aid effectiveness and indicates strong international commitment and cooperation to assist the government in its effort to ensure sustainable development and peace in the CHT." The statement also said CHT region is the home to 11 distinctive indigenous groups and ethnic Bangalees. Due to 25 years of protracted conflict, many of its 1.5 million people are facing extreme poverty and the region is in need of economic and social regeneration. The signing of the peace accord in Dec 1997 raised high expectations, not only within the CHT people but also across Bangladesh and internationally, that it would serve as the cornerstone of a successful peace building process and as a means for opening up new opportunities for development. bdn
