 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Half-centuries from Ricky Ponting and Mitchell Johnson helped Australia to secure a 50-run win over West Indies in their Champions Trophy Group A match at the Wanderers on Saturday. Johnson smashed his way to 73 not out off 47 balls with eight fours and three sixes while Ponting scored 79 runs off 95 deliveries as Australia posted 275 for eight in their first match of the tournament. In reply, West Indies could manage only 225 all out in 46.5 overs, with Dale Richards unable to bat due to injury. The defeat was West Indies' second consecutive loss of the tournament, effectively ruling them out of semi-final contention. The left-handed Johnson needed just 40 deliveries to bring up his maiden one-day-international (ODI) 50, eclipsing his previous ODI best of 43 not out scored against England at Lord's earlier this month. In the process, Johnson shared in an eighth-wicket partnership with Brett Lee (25) that realised 70 runs to boost the Australian score after they had stuttered to 171 for seven in the 40th over. So savage was Johnson's assault that 103 runs were scored off the last 10 overs of the Australian innings. Earlier, Ponting strode imperiously to his 69th ODI half-century before he was stumped by Walton off the bowling of left-arm spinner Nikita Miller. Ponting's departure came in the middle of an Australian slump in which the defending champions lost five wickets for 51 runs before Johnson's rescue act. Miller was at the heart of the Australian middle-order collapse as the 27-year-old captured two for 24 off 10 overs. The daunting Australian total proved too much for West Indies despite half-centuries from Andre Fletcher and Travis Dowlin. The duo built an 86-run second-wicket partnership before Fletcher was run out, for 54, by a direct hit from Johnson, fielding at mid-off. Dowlin made his way to a patient 55 off 87 balls before he top-edged a delivery from fast bowler Brett Lee and was caught by wicketkeeper Tim Paine. Monday, Australia take on India in Centurion while West Indies play their final match, against India, Wednesday at the Wande
