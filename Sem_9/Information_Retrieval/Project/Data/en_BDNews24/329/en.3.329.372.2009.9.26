 BEIJING, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-one people have been charged in connection with violent unrest in July that shook China's northwest region of Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs, state media said.

A total of 197 people were killed over several days of rioting in the ethnically divided city, most from the Han Chinese majority. Of the eight "leading" suspects identified in the report, six appear to be Uighurs. Friday's charges are the first connected to the July riots.

Beijing has threatened to use force, if necessary, to bring Taiwan under its rule
