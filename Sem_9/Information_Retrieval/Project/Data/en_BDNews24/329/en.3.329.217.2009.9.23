<TITLE> Indian soldiers, militants die in Kashmir battles </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SRINAGAR, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Indian soldiers and four Muslim militants were killed as gun battles raged in Kashmir on Wednesday after months of relative calm, police said. They said four soldiers were also wounded in two clashes that broke out in north Kashmir. "Fierce encounters are still going on. We are sure these militants have recently infiltrated from PoK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir)," an army spokesman said. New Delhi says Pakistan-based militant groups have stepped up efforts to push their members into Indian Kashmir before winter snow blocks the Himalayan mountain passes. Kashmir remains at the core of a six-decade-long conflict between India and Pakistan, which both claim in full but rule in part. Tens of thousands of people have been killed since a simmering discontent against Indian rule turned into a full-blown rebellion in 1989.
