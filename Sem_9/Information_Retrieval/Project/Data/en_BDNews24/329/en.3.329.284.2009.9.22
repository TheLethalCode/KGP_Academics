 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  The seven-match ODI series between England and Australia was too long and has disadvantaged the teams ahead of the Champions Trophy, according to Ricky Ponting, reports Cricinfo. The series finished in Durham on Sunday and the squads had to jet off almost immediately for the eight-team tournament in South Africa, where the other six sides had already been playing warm-up games. "I've always been against seven-match series," Ponting said after Australia's loss in the last game. "Every other team is in South Africa playing practice matches while we're finishing off this series. We know the reasons for it, but seven games head to head is a bit too many."

"We can't get carried away with what we've done," Ponting said. "We've got a few big games coming up in South Africa." Australia are in a group with India, Pakistan and a severely weakened West Indies, and the top two teams will move through into the semi-finals. It will be a significant change of pace after the languid one-dayers in England, which followed a tense Ashes campaign. Ponting said despite Australia losing the urn for the second time under his leadership, he had enjoyed immensely his time in England. "This has been if not the most enjoyable then one of the most enjoyable tours I've been on - and we lost the (Test) series as well," Ponting said. "I've enjoyed it from the start until the last ball was bowled. There was a lot made of the booing stuff that took place early on - that wasn't a big deal as far as I was concerned. I enjoyed the contest that was on the field with England through the Ashes series and I've enjoyed the games I've played here through the one-day
