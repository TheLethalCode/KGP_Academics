 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)--Another tremor shook capital Dhaka and many parts of Bangladesh early on Tuesday, from a 5.4 quake on the Myanmar border, less than twelve hours after the country was jolted by a 6.4 quake in Bhutan. Tuesday's quake struck at 2:38am local time, 552 km south-south eastern of Dhaka, Met Office official Mojibur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The epicentre of the quake was in Myanmar. The Met Office could not confirm how long the quake lasted. There was no report of casualties or damage to properties. Monday's quake struck at 3:53pm local time, 462km north northeast of Dhaka in Bhutan. It lasted for 20 seconds, according to some accounts. The tremor spread panic among people celebrating Eid and somewhat dampened the mood of the day that began with thunder and downpours in the morning. The last big quake to shake Bangladesh was felt in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet on Sept 4. The magnitude 6 quake was centred at the India-Myanmar border, east of Bangladesh. Earlier on Aug 11, Bangladesh was shaken by tremors as a major quake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India's Andaman Islands, sparking a tsunami warning in the region. Around 250,000 buildings in the three major cities of BangladeshDhaka, Chittagong and Sylhetare extremely vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a recent survey. Some 142,000 among 180,000 buildings in Chittagong; 24,000 out of 52,000 in Sylhet; and 78,000 out of 326,000 buildings in Dhaka were detected as risky. Experts observe that though disaster assessment has moved ahead with the survey, there have been hardly any tangible measures taken by way of disaster preparedness. b
