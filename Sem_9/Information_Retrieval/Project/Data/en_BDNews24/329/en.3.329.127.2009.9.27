 MANILA, Sep 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines appealed for international aid to help tens of thousands marooned by flashfloods, and apologized for the delays in rescue efforts to avoid potential political fallout from the crisis. Disaster officials said the death toll from Typhoon Ketsana that hit the main island of Luzon stood at 52 on Sunday and more than 20 others were missing feared dead. "We're doing our best to get to all those people still trapped by the flashflood," Anthony Golez, spokesman for the National Disaster Coordinating Council, told reporters, adding soldiers in rubber boats would evacuate them to safety. "We're sorry for the delays. We're encountering difficulty in reaching flooded areas. Hundreds remained on rooftops, waving and shouting for food, water and warm clothes as floodwaters began to subside in and around Manila on Sunday. Television images showed several houses and cars being swept by swollen rivers and clusters of people on the roofs of their homes.

FLIGHTS RESUME, SCHOOLS CLOSED Teodoro said massive rescue and relief efforts continued for the second day as thousands were still marooned in eastern Manila, which has been submerged in 3 meter-deep floodwaters. "We're appealing for more donations of food, water and warm clothes," Teodoro said, adding the United States and UN agencies had responded with boats, food, water and relief goods. Schools will be closed on Monday because most of them are being used as temporary shelters for more than 5,000 displaced families. Airport operations returned to normal and power supply was slowly being restored. Typhoon Ketsana, packing winds of up to 105 kph, hit the Philippines on Saturday and was now moving toward the South China Sea.
