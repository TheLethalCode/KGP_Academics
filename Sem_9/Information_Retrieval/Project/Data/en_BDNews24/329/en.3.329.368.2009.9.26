<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)--Journalists and employees loyal to the two battling directors, Mainul Hosein and Anwar Hossain Manju, clashed with each others on Saturday afternoon at the office of the Daily Itteffaq in Dhaka. The melee broke out around 6pm, and RAB and police officers entered the premises of Ittefaq, one of the oldest and largest-selling Bengali broadsheets. Hours after the clash and simmering tension, the newsroom of the daily went back to work around 8.30pm. Abul Khair, chief of the daily's journalist union, confirmed the incident and said three outsiders involved in pasting posters were detained into a room. "Resentment grew among journalists and employees after some outsiders went there to stick posters against one of the daily's directors, Anwar Hossain Manju," Khair said. He said few outsiders came to Ittefaq building and tried to put some posters. The posters read: "Ittefaq is not the place to whiten black money", "We want to know what is the deal Abul Khair made with Anwar Hossain Manju afte taking money from him." Khair said some people allegedly hired by Mainul entered the Ittefaq office to slap posters with messages against Manju, his younger brother and a politician. A man named 'Bazlu' was beaten around 8.30pm in front of Mainul's room. Those who were beating the man claimed themselves to be workers of Ittefaq. They said, "The guy was an outsider brought here by Mainul Hosein." Bazlu claimed that he was an Ittefaq worker. Access to the building at Ramkrishna Mission Road was restricted after the chaos. Police were deployed at the main entrance, and only ID card holders were allowed in. Manju stayed at the Ittefaq building from afternoon until 9pm, and had discussions with newsroom workers and union leaders. Mainul came half an hour after the incident, had a talk with a few selected people. At the time, a letter on his behalf was also sent to all the chief of sections and journalists and workers' units. Khair told bdnews24.com that Mainul called him with other journalists and press worker leaders last Thursday and asked where from they had got Tk 2 crore before Eid. They said they had got the money from accounts as their salary and bonus. They also told him that they did not know where the money had come from. "An outraged Mainul said, 'Anwar Hossain gave this money as bribe'," Khair added. At one point, Mainul tried to assault them and left the room, according to Khair. He also said Mainul threatened him with life and a meeting was called for Sunday to protest it and make other demands. Mainul in a letter, though, denied having made the threat and accused Khair of 'distributing the money' without the consent of the the publication's owners. The letter said, "I request other union leaders and journalists- workers to be aware of the activities of Abul Khair. There's no need to jump up and down. Everyone should remember that 1/11 is not over yet" One news staff, however, described the incident as "nothing big". The battle between two brothers for control of the daily is not new. A newspaper worker died when gunmen hired by the brothers fired shots and blasted bombs over control of the paper in the early 90s. In 2005 a press worker beheaded at night. On April 1, Hosein had told bdnews24.com "conspiracies" were ongoing against the daily. "We are fearing that (younger brother) Anwar Hossain Manju may create trouble using political advantages." Hosein is the chairman of the editorial board and elder son of founder Tofazzal Hossain Manik Mia. Manju snapped: "Why should I be scheming and plotting against Ittefaq? It was he who wrote to the deputy commissioner's office for permanent appointment of the acting editor. The Dhaka additional district magistrate allowed Saju Hosein, Mainul's wife, to take charge as stand-in publisher on Oct 17, 2007 while Manju was abroad. Later acting editor Rahat Khan took over as editor. The shuffle at the top followed sacking of scores of journalists and press workers and fresh appointments. Political power seesawed between the brothers over the years. Manju, the former publisher and editor of the paper published since Dec 24, 1953, was a powerful member of military strongman HM Ershad's cabinet in the 1980s. He was communications minister in the 1996-2001 cabinet of Sheikh Hasina, the incumbent prime minister. Mainul became law adviser to the 2007-2008 military-installed caretaker government before he quit abruptly. Manju left the country facing a slew of charges, and was convicted in more than one case, when Mainul became adviser. bdnews24.co
