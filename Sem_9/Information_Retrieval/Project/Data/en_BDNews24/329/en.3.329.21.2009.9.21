 Dhaka, Sep 21 (bdnews24.com)Eid festivities, in capital Dhaka and other parts of the country, were rattled first by thunderstorms and then by a quake on Monday. Following Eid congregations, held amid the morning's downpour, people eventually emerged onto the rain soaked streets to visit relatives and friends as part of the traditional festivities. Eid schedules were delayed, changed or postponed due to the bad weather. Dhaka saw more movement after the rain stopped around 1pm, but was shaken mid afternoon by tremors from an major earthquake in Bhutan. The morning began with an explosion of thunder and downpours of rain, braved by millions attending the congregations across the country that kick off celebrations of the biggest Muslim festival of the year. As every year, Sholakia hosted the largest Eid congregation of the country, beginning at 11am, with around 2,00,000 Muslims who defied heavy rains and thunder. Thousands from far and wide started flocking to the ground, spanning over seven acres of land, overnight. Maolana Farid Uddin Masud, chairman of the Islahul Muslimin Parishad, led the prayers in the morning. One of the oldest surviving congregation grounds in Bangladesh, established in 1828, the Sholakia Eidgah reportedly held 1.25 lakh people at its first congregation. Dhaka's main congregation was held at the National Eidgah Ground adjacent to the High Court at around 9am Monday, led by Khatib of Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, Maolana Mohammad Salauddin. The president, chief justice, Dhaka mayor, cabinet members and diplomats attended the gathering. Though there was protection from the rain for VIPs, ordinary people had to brave the morning downpour after a month of fasting and religious reflection. The Met office recorded 39mm of rainfall in Dhaka between 8am and midday. Met official Md Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com that parts of the country were experiencing rainfall as a monsoon front blew in overnight from the northern Bay of Bengal. Dhaka, and surrounding districts, along with the northern region, saw the worst of the thundershowers from morning. The rain receded over Dhaka and the north in the afternoon. But, Mannan said, the western region experienced downpours later as the monsoon was moving in a westerly direction. Quake rattles capital, other parts Dhaka and other parts of Bangladesh were jolted at 3:53pm as a 6.4 magnitude quake struck the Bhutan-China border 462km north northeast of Dhaka, Met official Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com. Dhaka residents said they felt it was an "unusually big jolt" for the capital. Reports came in of tall buildings in the city swaying with the force, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to property. The tremor spread some panic among people celebrating Eid and somewhat dampened the mood of the day, that began with thunder and downpours in the morning. Leaders issue Eid greetings President Zillur Rahman exchanged greetings with foreign diplomats, professionals and members of the public at Bangabhaban from 10:30am, prime minister Sheikh Hasina at Ganabhaban from 11am and opposition leader Khaleda Zia at Eskaton Ladies Club from 11:45am. The three leaders, in separate messages, also issued Eid greetings to Muslims of the world along with the people of Bangladesh. The prime minister later met the president at noon at his office. Traditional lights adorned public and private buildings, including the prime minister's office, secretariat, High Court, hotels, clubs and community centres at night. bdne
