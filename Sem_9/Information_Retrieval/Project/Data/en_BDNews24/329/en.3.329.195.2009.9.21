 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is due to leave for New York on Monday night, to attend the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Summit. Flying out on a regular Emirates flight at 10:30pm, the prime minister will land in the US on Sep 22. She is scheduled to stay for a week, before returning on Oct 1. Foreign minister Dipu Moni is already in the US. Hasina will address climate change issues and join in talks with leaders of countries contributing UN peacekeeping troops around the world, as part of a packed schedule, said foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, who will join the prime minister's 23-member delegation to the UN assembly. Others include cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad, former envoy Mohammad Ziauddin, MP Nasrul Hamid Bipu and columnist Mustafa Nurul Islam. The prime minister will attend a meeting of 25 heads of state and government on climate change, convened by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, on Sept 22, where she will seek to unite the worse-affected countries and resolve compensation claims for climate change, Quayes has said. Hasina and US president Barack Obama are also scheduled to attend a sideline meeting of nine countries contributing major UN peacekeeping forces around the world to be held on Sept 23. Bangladesh is a leading contributor to the peacekeeping missions, with around 10,000 personnel from the country engaged in different missions around the world.
