 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)Hindus were felicitated Wednesday by the country's top leaders as the second largest religious community was set to celebrate its biggest festival, the Sharadiya Durga Puja, from Thursday. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition BNP leader Khaleda Zia released messages greeting the Hindus. "Bangladesh is a glaring example of communal harmony," the president said and added a concerted effort was needed to build a happy and prosperous nation upholding this tradition. Festivals such as the Durga Puja, he said, helped consolidate the communal harmony. Hasina said the Durga Puja symbolised truth and beauty as well as destruction of evil.

BNP chief Khaleda termed Bangladesh a country of religious harmony. "BNP is committed to protecting the religious freedom of everyone in this country," she said. "We don't believe in minority and majority theories. Our biggest identity is we are all Bangladeshis.
