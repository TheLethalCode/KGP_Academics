 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) The bomb-like object recovered on Friday night from a playground near a Durga Puja pavilion in Banani in Dhaka was not an Arges grenade, the RAB director general has said. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said, "It was a grenade-like defused explosive." "It is yet to be known what it is as it is much old. But it is not possible to use this to carry any act of sabotage ." "We guess somebody dumped it at Banani playground either to be free of burden or to create panic," Khandaker said. Gulshan police chief Mohammed Kamaluddin said, "RAB is yet to tell us anything after they recovered an object suspected to be a bomb." But police filed a complaint saying that an explosive-like object was recovered from Banani playground, he informed. The media cell of Dhaka Metropolitan Police in a text message at around 11:30pm said it was not a bomb, hours after RAB said they did retrieve a bomb. bd
