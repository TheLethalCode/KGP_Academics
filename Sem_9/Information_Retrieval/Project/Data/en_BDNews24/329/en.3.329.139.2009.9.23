<TEXT>
 Kushtia, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)'Top extremist' Rashedul Islam was killed in a so-called gun battle with the police early on Wednesday in north Lahini in Kushtia suburbs. Rashed, the chief of 'Rashedul legion of Kushtia' was identified as the son of late Rustam Ali of Mill Line Bhataparha of Kushtia Sadar. Kushtia Sadar police chief AKM Faruque Hossain said, acting on a tip-off that a gang of terrorists were assembled in a secret rendezvous in Taltala ground of North Lahini early on Wednesday, a RAB-12 contingent and Kushtia Sadar police raided the spot. The miscreants opened fire at them and the law enforcers retaliated, he added. As Rashedul was downed during the 50-round fire exchange, the terrorists fled the scene. Police retrieved a shutter gun and three rounds of ammo from there, Hossain said. Rashedul's body was sent for autopsy. Rashedul had four murder cases, 18 other cases including those under the Arms Act and 26 complaints filed against him with the Sadar Police Station, he said. A special crackdown of the law enforcing agencies to suppress militancy in the south and south-western regions is ongoing. State minister for home Shamsul Islam Tuku said the militants have been asked to surrender or the drive will be intensified further. Human-rights organisation 'Odhikar' said 19 people were killed in the country in August in 'crossfire, encounter, gunfight', of whom 10 were members of various banned militant outfits. It said 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". RAB said 577 people died in 472 incidents up to Aug 31 since the special force was raised on March 26, 2004. The human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. Home minister Sahara Khatun, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. Tuku has trashed the human-rights organisations' allegations. "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bdnews
