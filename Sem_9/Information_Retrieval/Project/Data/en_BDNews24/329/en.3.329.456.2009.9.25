 Dhaka, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League chief Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has said the party would not tamper with the country's constitution which was drafted under the leadership of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "AL believes in democracy, not in vote rigging," she said, while distributing cloths among distressed people at Dhakeswari National Temple after visiting the Durga Puja Mandap there on Friday. Chowdhury, senior presidium member and also the deputy leader of parliament, greeted members of the Hindu community on behalf of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. She said, "We want to build a secular Bangladesh in cooperation with all sections of the people, but certain evil quarters are trying to create unrest." "We'll fight them with the great spirit of Goddess Durga," Chowdhury added. Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Thursday said his ministry would write to the Law Commission for amending the country's constitution. Recommendations for bringing necessary amendment to the constitution will be prepared on the basis of the Commission's opinions, he told reporters. On the same day, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said the AL will not seek to change the constitution even though it enjoys absolute majority. "The government would like to see the required changes such as the caretaker government system, the tenure of the parliament and the local government system. But any such change would be brought about through dialogue with all," he added. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin MP, Haji Selim, CR Dutta, among others, also visited the Dhakeswari temple. bdnew
