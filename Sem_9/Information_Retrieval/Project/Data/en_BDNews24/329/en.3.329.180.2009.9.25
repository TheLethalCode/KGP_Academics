 Chittagong, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)--Chittagong city Awami League chief ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has come under criticism for meeting with BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury who faces war crimes charges. A section of leaders, known to be followers of Nurul Islam BSC, MP for Chittagong-8 and vice-president of the city AL, has demanded action against Mohiuddin, also Chittagong City mayor, in a statement Nurul Islam and Mohiuddin are said to be at each other's throats and have been separately running the organisational activities. Salauddin Quader on Tuesday held a closed-door meeting with Mohiuddin at the latter's residence. Chittagong City Corporation officials and Awami League leaders, who were present there, said it was a courtesy meeting where they exchanged Eid greetings. Salauddin is widely accused of killing and aiding Pakistan army during the independence war and trying to smear independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The statement said that the ruling Awami League has been vocal about the trial of Salauddin Quader on charge of war crimes, including killing of scores of freedom fighters. The statement was signed by city Awami League member Jamshedul Alam Chowdhury and contained the names of Nurul Islam BSC, city Awami League committee's vice presidents Nayeemuddin Chowdhury, Mahtab Uddin Chowdhury, Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, city Awami League, among others. Many city Awami League and Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders, known as followers of Mohiuddin, are also not too happy about the meeting. Preferring not to be named, some said the meeting with those against whom they have been agitating amounted to betraying their politics. No-one should exchange Eid greetings with such a controversial person, they asserted. bdnew
