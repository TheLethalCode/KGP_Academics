<TITLE> Atiur, again, prods banks to lend </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com)Large sums of money are lying unused in Bangladesh's banks, due in part to continued sluggish mood of investors, governor Atiur Rahman said Sunday. "Investment has stagnated on the one hand, remittance from the non-resident (Bangladeshis) has gone up on the other," the governor told the chief executives of banks. The Bangladesh Bank says the so-called excess liquidity now stands at nearly Tk 35,000 crore with the private banks. The governor said that putting this excess liquidity to use posed the biggest challenge for the central bank. Atiur said the first quarter of 2009-10 showed no signs of investment recovery after a sluggish 2008-09, piling up the huge cash. "The central bank will be very pleased if our banks lend more in productive sectors rather than sink families and individuals in debts used for unnecessary consumption and luxury," he said, in his latest attempt to turn things around. "Unfortunately, barring a few exceptions, the private banks have been more interested in lending for luxury than for productive, job-creating SMEs or agriculture." In a culture created by the public penchant for spending more than income, he said, loans for luxury led to the current crisis in the West. "We all know the consequences. And our banks must learn from this." bdne
