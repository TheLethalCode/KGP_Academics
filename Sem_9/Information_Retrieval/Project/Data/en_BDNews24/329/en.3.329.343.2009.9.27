 Syed Nahas Pasha, UK Correspondent London, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com) Abdul Jalil, who hit the headlines last week with his outrageous claims that the Dec 29 vote results had been fixed, says he will come up with more and "always speak the truth". Talking to bdnews24.com Saturday night, Jalil, now in the UK, vowed nothing would deter him from speaking the truth. The Awami League MP, sidelined into the party's showcase council of advisers with no executive role, also disclosed he had been suffering from kidney ailments. "I am sick. I am taking medicine," he said. The comments made in a recent interview with bdnews24.com kicked up a lot of political dust, leading to angry outbursts from party supporters in Bangladesh and Britain, where the visiting former minister vented his frustration. The bdnews24.com interview followed a short broadcast on ethnic station Bangla TV in which he renewed his attack on the military intelligence agency DGFI. The former Awami League general secretary's remarks were immediately seized upon by the rival BNP leaders, prompting a we-told-you-so reaction from secretary general Khondaker Delwar Hossain. On Sept. 23, Jalil had told bdnews24.com: "It was my mistake not to go against her (Sheikh Hasina). My offence was extreme loyalty to her." "Sheikh Hasina ordered me from America to take rest," he said of her pre-election decision, adding he did not protest the leader's command. "My decision was wrong. I should have taken her head-on." Later on Thursday, a day after his interview, Jalil was assaulted by UK Juba League workers for his scathing attack on the party chief. The AL MP, who chairs the parliamentary committee on commerce ministry, is in the UK on a private visit, during which he opened an outlet of a bank he partly owns. bdn
