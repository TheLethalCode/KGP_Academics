 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Eid day in the capital and other areas of the country began with an explosion of thunder and downpours of rain, but it didn't deter millions from attending the open-air congregations that kick off celebrations of the biggest Muslim festival of the year. Dhaka's main congregation was held at the National Eidgah Ground adjacent to the High Court at around 9am Monday, led by Khatib of Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, Maolana Mohammad Salauddin. The president, chief justice, Dhaka mayor, cabinet members and diplomats attended the gathering. Though there was protection from the rain for VIPs, ordinary people had to brave the morning downpour after a month of fasting and religious reflection. Five congregations were scheduled to be held between 8am and midday at Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, but rain delayed proceedings. The Met office recorded 39mm of rainfall in Dhaka between 8am and midday. Met official Md Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com that parts of the country were experiencing rainfall as a monsoon front blew in overnight from the northern Bay of Bengal. Dhaka, and surrounding districts, along with the northern region, saw the worst of the thundershowers from morning. The rain is likely to recede over Dhaka and the north in the afternoon, Mannan said. But, he said, the western region will experience downpours later as the monsoon was moving in a westerly direction. bdne
