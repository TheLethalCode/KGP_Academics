 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)--The bomb-like object recovered on Friday night from a playground near a Durga Puja pavilion in Banani in Dhaka was not a bomb, police say, hours after RAB said they did retrieve a bomb. The media cell of Dhaka Metropolitan Police in a text message at around 11:30pm said Puja normally going on at all Puja pavilions, including the one at Banani. The city police also urged everyone not to panic. The RAB recovery spread panic among Hindu devotees celebrating Durga Puja. Additional director general colonel Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they found the bomb at 8:15pm, kept in a tubular can of Pringles potato chips beside a wall outside the pavilion "On a tip-off that somebody was carrying bombs at the Puja pavilion, we came and recovered the bomb." "Area near the bomb has been sealed. Work is on to defuse it." The bomb might have been kept to spread panic, he said and added that people in the pavilion had been evacuated safely. "RAB's bomb disposal unit has taken the bomb to examine it. People could have been injured if it was detonated." RAB personnel and sniffer dogs started searching the playground at around 10pm, Rahman added. A RAB man involved in the operation said it seemed similar to a grenade at first sight. Speaking to reporters, a member of Gulshan Puja Udjapan Committee, Santosh Sharma, said, "A brief break was taken from the Puja to facilitate the search of the pavilion." He also said none of them had had any knowledge of it until RAB went to find out the bomb. The celebrations were back on track there around half an hour later. bd
