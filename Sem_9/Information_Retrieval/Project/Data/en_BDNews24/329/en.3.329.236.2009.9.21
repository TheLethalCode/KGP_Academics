 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)Capital Dhaka and the rest of Bangladesh were shaken as a 6.4 magnitude quake struck the Bhutan-China border on Monday. The quake struck at 3:53pm local time, 462km north northeast of Dhaka, Met official Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com. Dhaka residents said they felt it was an "unusually big jolt" for the capital. Reports came in of tall buildings in the city swaying with the force, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to property. The tremor spread some panic among people celebrating Eid and somewhat dampened the mood of the day, that began with thunder and downpours in the morning. The quake that lasted for some 20 seconds, by some accounts, sent people scurrying for safety out in the open. bdnews24.com correspondents from Mymensingh, Netrokona, Sherpur, Rangpur, Sirajganj, Tangail, Sunamganj and Nilphamari correspondents said the jolt was also felt in those districts. bdnews24.com's Panchagharh correspondent also said it was felt in the northwest. The last quake to shake Bangladesh was felt in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet on Sept 4. The magnitude 6 quake was centred at the India-Myanmar border, east of Bangladesh. Earlier on Aug 11, Bangladesh was shaken by tremors as a major quake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India's Andaman Islands, sparking a tsunami warning in the region. Around 250,000 buildings in the three major cities of BangladeshDhaka, Chittagong and Sylhetare extremely vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a recent survey. Some 142,000 among 180,000 buildings in Chittagong; 24,000 out of 52,000 in Sylhet; and 78,000 out of 326,000 buildings in Dhaka were detected as risky.
