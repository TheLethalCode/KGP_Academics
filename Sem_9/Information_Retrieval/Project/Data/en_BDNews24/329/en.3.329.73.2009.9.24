 Probir Kumar Sarker bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com)Hindus in Bangladesh began celebrating Durga Puja, their biggest religious festival, on Thursday. Final touches were put to Puja preparations across the country on Wednesday. "We're a little late in our preparations due to the sudden rains and the Eid vacation," Kazal Devnath, the Dhaka Metropolitan Sarbajanin Puja Committee president, said to bdnews24.com. The Puja will take place in 172 pavilions in the capital, nine more from the previous year. It would be observed in over 23,000 pavilions, up 200 from 22,800 stalls last year. Devnath said, "The culture of vandalising idols before Puja, which developed over the past few years, seems to have ended." Monsoon rains are likely to continue for another week and dampen the festivities of Durga Puja as they did to Eid-ul-Fitr, the Met Office said on Wednesday. "The weather might remain fine on Thursday and Friday, and then it is likely to turn foul again during the Puja," Shah Alam, deputy director of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com. Rituals According to the Puran, the Fortnight of the Goddess (Devi Pakkha) begins through Mahalaya which follows Pritripakkha. During the preceding fortnight (Pakkhah), devotees offer ricewater (Anna Jal) for the salvation of their forefathers, which is known as Tarpan in scripture. The Sasthhi (sixth day) begins in the morning with 'Kalparambha'planning of the ceremonies to be taken place until Nabomiin the morning. Bodhon (awakening) starts in the afternoon under a wood-apple tree followed by 'Amontron' (invitation) and 'Odhibas' (prelude) in the evening. The next daythe Shaptomicomprises separate Pujas for all beside Durga with Shorash Upachar, a dish with 16 food items. 'Mahasnan' (great bathing) takes place on the Oshtomi, where 'Kumari Puja'a symbolic presentation of motherly Durgais another significant ritual of the festival. The Nabami includes 'Ayudha Puja' when everyone gives their tools of the trade -- pens, books, school work, automobiles and machinery -- a rest and ritually worships them. The rituals end on the 10th day, 'Vijaya Dashami', when devotees bid Durga a tearful goodbye and invite her to return next year. Myth and significance Durga--the name literally means "Beyond Reach"--is worshipped to achieve the spirit of good values by removing the evils inside. She is a youthful, multi-armed deity who successfully battles the mighty buffalo demon 'Mahishashura' that symbolises among other things, the elemental powers of brutish ignorance. The Goddess Durga was born from the energies of the male divinities when the gods lost the long drawn-out battle with the Asuras (demons). All the energies of the gods united and became supernova, throwing out flames in all directions. Then that unique light, pervading the Three Worlds with its luster, combined into one, and became a female form. The spirit of Durga Puja states that if a person respects and adores a woman as a mother, they will be able to easily get rid of the six cardinal sinssex, anger, greed, infatuation, vanity and envy. The victory of the 'good' over the 'bad' through a battle is depicted in the celebrations, where 'Maa Durga' is the symbol of 'good' to fight the 'evil' Mahishasur. The Puja rituals consists of three major festivalsMahalaya, Bodhon and Sandhi Puja. Beside Durga and her offspringLakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik and GaneshMohishasur is also included as he called her mother and repented of his past evil deeds. He had no respect for the women and wanted to marry Durga, who symbolises the portrait of a motherly spirit. Mahishasur convinced Lord Brahma, who created the universe, with his prayers and demanded immortality. Brahma refused but then blessed him saying that no 'man' could kill him. Mahishasur became ruthless towards the gods and started to drive them out of the heaven. The gods were united at the Asrom of Kattyan Muni and as a result of the outcome of their meditation a body was produced, where the spirit of Durga, the wife of 'Shiva', appeared with their powers. Durga, with the combination of all the powers, defeated Mohishasur and instituted the regime of 'good'.
