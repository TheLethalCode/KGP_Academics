 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina are out of the country now. Prime minister Hasina was the first to fly out on Monday night, on way to New York to attend the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Summit. Rahman boarded a regular Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight at around 2pm for Saudi Arabia, for a six-day visit, on his first overseas trip as president. Hasina will address climate change issues and join in talks with leaders of countries contributing UN peacekeeping troops around the world, as part of a weeklong trip, said foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, who will join the prime minister's 23-member delegation to the UN assembly. Foreign minister Dipu Moni was already in New York ahead of the UN meet. Other delegation members include cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad, former envoy Mohammad Ziauddin, MP Nasrul Hamid Bipu and columnist Mustafa Nurul Islam. The prime minister will attend a meeting of 25 heads of state and government on climate change, convened by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, on Sept 22, where she will seek to unite the worse-affected countries and resolve compensation claims for climate change, Quayes has said. Hasina and US president Barack Obama are due to attend a sideline meeting of nine countries contributing major UN peacekeeping forces around the world to be held on Sept 23. Bangladesh is a leading contributor to the peacekeeping missions, with around 10,000 personnel from the country engaged in different missions around the world. The prime minister is scheduled to attend a luncheon hosted by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in honour of women heads of governments and women foreign ministers, on Sept 24.
