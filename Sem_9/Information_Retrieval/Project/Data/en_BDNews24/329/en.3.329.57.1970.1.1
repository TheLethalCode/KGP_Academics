 JOHANNESBURG, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States shut its embassy and other American government offices in South Africa on Tuesday due to an undisclosed security threat, but police said the situation was under control. South African Police Commissioner Bheki Cele did not give details of the threat and said he could not rule out the possibility of a hoax while investigations continued. "It is under control," he told reporters in Cape Town. "The threat might be genuine itself or the threat might not exist, it might be a hoax. If our investigation puts some concrete steps that we must follow, there will be arrests," he said, adding that police were pursuing some people. A U.S. embassy spokeswoman said it was the first time in a decade the offices had been closed due to a security threat. South Africa, due to host the soccer World Cup finals next year, is not itself seen as a target for terrorists. Somali rebels have vowed to avenge the killing last week of one of the continent's most wanted al Qaeda suspects in a raid by U.S. commandos, but there has been no previous link between Somali insurgents and South Africa. Bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 killed 224 people and wounded thousands. A State Department spokesman in Washington said the U.S. government was warning American citizens to be extra vigilant while near U.S. government facilities in South Africa. "We are maintaining close contact with South African authorities on this issue," he said, adding that the facilities would reopen as soon as the security situation permits. As well as the embassy, there are U.S. consulates in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. U.S. embassy spokeswoman Sharon Hudson-Dean said the current assumption was that the offices would reopen on Wednesday. In addition to the embassy and consulates, there are also other U.S. government offices, including that of USAID. A spokeswoman for the British High Commission said it had not been informed of anything.
