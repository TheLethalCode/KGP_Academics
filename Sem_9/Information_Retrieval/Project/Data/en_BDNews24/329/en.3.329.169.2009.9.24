 LOS ANGELES, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "ObamaVision" -- the term coined by the media to sum up President Barack Obama's pledge to bring hope and change to America -- was on Wednesday deemed the most influential English word from television in 2009. "ObamaVision" was first heard during last year's U.S. presidential election campaign.

"Michael Jackson" whose death in June triggered days of wall-to-wall news coverage, and "Susan Boyle" -- the British singer who became an overnight sensation after appearing on a televised talent show -- came third and fourth. The Texas-based Global Language Monitor uses an algorithm to search printed and electronic media and the Internet for trends in word usage and their impact on culture. It issues its Top 1O Telewords to coincide with the official start of the U.S. television season in late September.

The Top 10 Telewords of 2009 are: 1) ObamaVision 2) Financial Meltdown 3) Michael Jackson 4) Susan Boyle 5) Hulu.com 6) Vampires 7) Dar Dour (The Iraqi TV show spoof) 8) Wizards 9) "And that's the way it is," (the signoff of late U.S. news anchor Walter Cronkite) 10) Jiggl
