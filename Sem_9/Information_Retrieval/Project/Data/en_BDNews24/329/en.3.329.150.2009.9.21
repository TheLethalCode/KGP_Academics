 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said her administration will do nothing that will harm the country and asked people to cooperate for a tangible solution to the energy and power crisis. "I am the daughter of Bangabandhu. He has sacrificed his life for the sake of the country. I will not do anything to harm the country," Hasina said to reporters at the Gana Bhaban on Monday. She spoke to the media as she exchanged Eid greetings with people from broad social spectrum and foreign diplomats. The prime minister said some quarters are trying to confuse people over the government's decision to lease out gas blocks in the Bay of Bengal. "Gas cannot be extracted if the blocks are not leased out and power cannot be generated. We will not do any such work harmful to the country," she said. "It is not possible to solve power crisis overnight. We are trying to reach a solution even after all problems." Hasina urged the nation to have trust in her administration and not to get puzzled by propaganda. "If we had worked against the interest of the country we could go to power again in 2001," Hasina, who headed 1996-2001 Awami League government. She said people had no Eid happiness during the five-year term of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government and they could not celebrate the festival in an open environment during the tenure of the 2007-08 military-backed caretaker government. "People are celebrating Eid in an democratic environment after seven long years." The prime minister repeated the pledge of her administration to rein in the prices of commodities. "We are trying our best, even though there are some exceptions. The price of sugar soared all of a sudden despite adequate stocks." She termed the sudden hike of sugar price 'a conspiracy'. "We could not manage everything in nine months. Measures will be taken so that nobody can make such ploy in future." The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh that was made ineffective by the four-party alliance government will be revived, Hasina said. She asked the well-off to stand beside the destitute and the poor. "We have to change the fate of people with low income." Hasina also spoke about the state of the readymade garment industry, the country's biggest foreign exchange earner. "The workers are paid very low. Even after that the owners could not give them salaries and bonuses in time." She said some people tried to destabilise the industry by provoking the workers. They did not have much success as the law-enforcers intervened in time, the prime minister said. "We are determined to meet the expectations of people to keep their faith in tact at any rate." On the law and order, the prime minister said: "The government is making its best efforts to maintain law and order. Actions are being taken against the mugging incidents." She sought assistance from people in curbing social crimes. bd
