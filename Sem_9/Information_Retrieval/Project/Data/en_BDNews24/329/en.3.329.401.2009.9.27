<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Chelsea's perfect start to the season under new manager Carlo Ancelotti came to a surprise end on Saturday when the Premier League leaders lost 3-1 at Wigan Athletic and had goalkeeper Petr Cech sent off. Titus Bramble headed Wigan in front before Didier Drogba equalised at the start of the second half. Cech was then shown a red card for bringing down Hugo Rodallega and the Colombian fired his penalty past substitute keeper Hilario. Paul Scharner scored Wigan's third goal in stoppage time. Chelsea, who had won their first six league games of the season, slipped below Manchester United on goal difference after the champions cruised to a 2-0 win at Stoke City. United and Chelsea have 18 points from seven matches. There were big wins for Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur who occupy third and fourth spots, three points behind the leaders. Fernando Torres hit a hat-trick for Liverpool in a 6-1 thrashing of Hull City and Robbie Keane went one better for Spurs, scoring four in a 5-0 hammering of Burnley. Arsenal moved into fifth place after Robin van Persie's goal earned a 1-0 win at London rivals Fulham, a victory they owed to several fine saves from reserve goalkeeper Vito Mannone. Portsmouth's misery continued with a 1-0 home defeat by Everton which means they have lost all seven league games this season, the worst start in the top flight for 79 years. Aston Villa lost 2-1 at Blackburn Rovers to end a four-match winning streak in the league and Bolton Wanderers beat Birmingham City 2-1. Wigan's first victory over Chelsea in the Premier League was a landmark day for new manager Roberto Martinez whose side moved into mid-table. SPANISH SUCCESS "We showed a great attitude and great determination to win the game and we fully deserved it," Martinez told Sky Sports. "The intensity and concentration was fantastic," added the Spaniard who had seen his side suffer heavy defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal this season. Chelsea, who last tasted defeat in March, could have few complaints at the outcome and there was further cause for concern for Ancelotti when left back Ashley Cole was carried off near the end. Bramble was allowed time and space to head Wigan in front after 16 minutes but after a poor first-half display Chelsea got lucky two minutes after the interval when Drogba's scuffed shot trickled through keeper Chris Kirkland's legs. The match swung Wigan's way after 51 minutes when Cech clipped Rodallega's leg and was sent off. Chelsea hunted an equaliser but it was Wigan who looked the more dangerous side on the break and they sent their fans into raptures when Scharner sealed victory. "Today was not a good day for us, we didn't play well and they deserved to win," said Ancelotti before adding he had no complaints with the referee's decision to red-card Cech. Manchester United were frustrated for an hour by a resolute Stoke side but their pressure eventually paid off when substitute Ryan Giggs unlocked the home defence with a perfect pass for Dimitar Berbatov to side-foot into the net. Giggs then teed up John O'Shea for United's second. "It's always good to win away from home. You can never relax at Stoke but it was a good performance by us," said United manager Alex Fergu
