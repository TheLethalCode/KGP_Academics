 Shehabuddin Kisslu, from New York New York, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com)--US president Barack Obama has agreed to visit Bangladesh. Obama, who along with wife, Michelle, hosted a reception for the heads of state and government, at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York at 7pm (NY time), told prime minister Sheikh Hasina that he will be pleased to visit Bangladesh. Hasina informally invited the Obama couple at the reception to come to Bangladesh. Officials at the prime minister's office told bdnews24.com that Hasina exchanged greetings with Obama, who sat next to each other, and talked with him for while. The US president expressed his willingness to visit Bangladesh, said NY-based journalist Abu Taher quoting a delegate accompanying Hasina. Obama appreciated Hasina's speech at the luncheon, which he had earlier hosted for heads of top ten troops and police-contributing countries to the UN peacekeeping missions at the UN Conference room in New York. "I liked your speech very much. We all have to work together for peace and welfare of humanity," Obama was quoted as saying to Hasina. She replied: "You inspired millions of people with your slogan for 'Change'. And for that, greetings to you on behalf of Bangladesh." Hasina said that her party has also called for a shift from old way of politics in Bangladesh and sought everybody's help in the initiative. "Your Cairo speech for the Muslim world was appreciated everywhere. Millions of people in Bangladesh want to see you. They want to listen to you," the prime minister was further quoted as telling Obama. Obama replied, "I have long aspired to visit Bangladesh. It is now a matter of time. Visiting Bangladesh will be a pleasant experience." Earlier in the afternoon, Al Jazeera interviewed Hasina in her hotel room at Grand Hyatt New York. Hasina arrived in New York City via Dubai to attend the United Nations General Assembly Session on Tuesday. In the first programme of her eight-day trip to New York, Hasina attended a private working dinner hosted by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon at the UNDDR. The prime minister's office sources said she is set to hold bilateral talks with the Nepal prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal at 11am and Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed at 12:30pm on Thursday (NY time). Later in the day, at 1:30pm, the prime minister is also scheduled to attend a luncheon hosted by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in honour of women heads of government and women foreign ministers. Hasina in her hotel suite will also speak to Far Eastern Economic Review and before that, she will attend a views-exchange session with the business community in her hotel room. bdnews
