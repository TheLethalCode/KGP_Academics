 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is set to address the United Nations General Assembly in Bangla on Saturday, between 8:00pm and 12:00am BdST, as the eighth speaker. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will be the second to address the general assembly in Bangla," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, former permanent representative to the UN, told bdnews24.com on Friday by telephone from Singapore. Her father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the first to address the Assembly in Bangla on Sep 23, 1974, he said. But Baby Moudud, who accompanied Hasina to the Assembly in 1996, claimed that the prime minister had given her speech in Bangla then. Moudud on Saturday told bdnews24.com the 40-minute speech was translated in English. Foreign ministry sources say Hasina will, however, be the third head of government to address any UN session in Bangla. Chowdhury, a former foreign adviser to the 2007-08 caretaker government who was then the director general of the UN desk at the foreign ministry, said: "Then prime minister Khaleda Zia addressed the UN's special session on children in Bangla in 1992." "I translated her Bangla speech into English," said Foreign ministry sources say Sheikh Mujib had for the first time delivered his address as prime minister in Bangla after Bangladesh got UN membership on Sep 17, 1974. bdnews24.com/krc/sum/pks/bd/1548h.
