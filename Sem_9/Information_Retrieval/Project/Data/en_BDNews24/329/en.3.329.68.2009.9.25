 CENTURION, South Africa, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AB de Villiers scored an 70 to steer South Africa to a five-wicket win over New Zealand in Champions Trophy Group B Thursday. The hosts, who lost their opening match to Sri Lanka, will now go into their final group game against England Sunday knowing that victory would almost certainly book them a place in the semi-finals. New Zealand were sent in to bat and compiled a mediocre 214 all out built around Ross Taylor's 72 off 105 deliveries.

New Zealand opening batsman Brendon McCullum scored 44, before Taylor and South African-born Grant Elliott (39) combined for a fourth-wicket stand of 71. But the Black Caps suffered a late collapse in which they lost their last five wickets for 11 runs. Wayne Parnell, expensive in his first two spells, returned to claim three more wickets and finish with career-best figures of five for 57. Hashim Amla (38) and Kallis (36) put on 52 for the second wicket to keep South Africa on target after the early loss of captain Graeme Smith. Kallis looked particularly impressive, being quick to get on the front foot as he stroked six fours off 39 deliveries, before edging a leg-cutter from Shane Bond to wicketkeeper McCullum. The glovework of McCullum was the highlight in the field for New Zealand as he also took fine catches standing up to pace bowlers Daryl Tuffey and Kyle Mills to remove JP Duminy for 11 and Mark Boucher for
