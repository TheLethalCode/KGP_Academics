 MUMBAI, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian energy firms are likely to team up with foreign players to bid in the country's largest auction of exploration blocks, and majors including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are among global players showing interest during an ongoing roadshow, a top offical said. Previous licensing rounds have been dominated by local firms, but Sunil Kumar Srivastava, deputy director general at India's Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, believes tie-ups between foreign and Indian firms may now be in the offing. The auction of about 70 exploration blocks could generate bids of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, a government official has said previously. Bidding closes on Oct. 12. "The response seems to be very good and people are very, very upbeat about it," Srivastava told Reuters in an interview, noting that 60 to 70 companies have inspected the auction documents, including all of the world's biggest energy firms. In the past, however, interest among foreign players in Indian exploration auctions has not always translated into bids. Players showing interest during a global marketing roadshow include ConocoPhillips, Eni SpA and BP Plc, Srivastava said. "Indian companies have been going and talking to other companies to give their credentials and strengths and we believe there will be lot of partnerships," he said on Tuesday.
