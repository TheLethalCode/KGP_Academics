 Dhaka,Sep 24(bdnews24.com)--The government is set to start implementing second amended Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) from early next year after finalising the procedure by December. The approximate expenditure for implementing the two-year strategy paper, styled "Steps towards Change: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction-II," and prepared with the five-year plan, is estimated at Tk 31,0827 crore. Finance minister A M A Muhith and planning minister A K Khandaker briefed the press after a meeting with LCG representatives at Economic Relation Division (ERD) auditorium on Thursday. ERD secretary and LCG co-chaiman M Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, DFID chief cum LCG co-chairman Cris Austin and representatives of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and donor countries attended the meeting. Planning minister AK Khandaker said, "The PRSP will reflect public opinion and it has been placed in the parliament to this end." "The implementation of the paper will start after it is finalised by December," Khandaker said. He said, the donors had assured Bangladesh of required financial assistance for alleviating poverty through achieving high growth at that time. He alleged that the preceding governments formulated and followed PRSP blindly without any discussion. No evaluation was made in the past to determine the outcome - positive or negative of the PRSP, the minister said. Even the caretaker government formulated second PRSP without consulting anyone, the minister said. "We have moved to amend second PRSP formulated during the immediate past caretaker government in line with our electoral pledges," the minister said. Amended second PRSP was placed before the cabinet on Sep 9 and the planning minister tabled the amended PRSP-2 in the House on Sep 15 for the opinions of the lawmakers. The government would finalise the amended second PRSP after getting green signal from the House in November, the minister said Stressing the need for rapid steps for implementing the PRSP project, the minister said, "Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the planning ministry will have to be strengthened and relevant ministries must work seriously." Sounding optimism, the minister said ,"We will be able to implement PRSP much better and reach near our target." The first PRSP titled "Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR I) was implemented during the FY 2005-07 in the tenure of former BNP government. The parliament members' opinions were overlooked at the time, Khandaker said. It was extended up to June 2008. The minister criticised the last caretaker government for preparing and approving the second PRSP without assessment. He had told parliament it was difficult to reach the success of development activities to the people without the help of people's representatives. The government is interested to adopt PRSP-2 as an interim system as it has initiated to implement the sixth 'five-year plan' from the year 2010-11 to 2014-15. It includes five strategies -- macroeconomic management, enhancing investment, infrastructural development for economic growth, social security and human resource development -- for poverty reduction. Finance minister AMA Muhith said it was not calculated during formulation of the first PRSP how much money would be required for implementing project. On PRSP-2, he said, as much as $ 1658 crore in loan and aid would be needed during the next three years to implement the second PRSP. "A big chunk of it will come from local and overseas investment under public-private partnership." Muhith said the donors at the meeting stressed the need for beefing up monitoring to gain the objectives of PRSP. At the beginning of the meeting, General Economic Division (GED) member Shamsul Alam highlighted different aspects of the project. Alam said the project would cost Tk 31,0827 crore plus accompanied expenditures (including interests on loan) of Tk 64,259 crore. The total expenditure will amount to Tk 37,5086 crore, of which Tk 20,9040 crore will come from government revenue and Tk 50000 crore in loan from internal sources. The deficit in implementing PRSP will amount to Tk 1,60,000 crore equivalent to $1.66 billion. DFID's Chris Austin said they would continue assistance in necessary strategy implementations, including macroeconomic management and economic growth. bdnews
