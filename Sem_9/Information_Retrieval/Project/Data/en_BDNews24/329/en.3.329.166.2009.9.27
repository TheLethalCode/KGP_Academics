<TITLE> Decision on Jalil in Oct 3 meeting: Matia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League will decide on Oct 3 what is to be done about the controversies former general secretary Abdul Jalil stirred through his statements in London recently, AL presidium member Matia Chowdhury has said. In an interview given to bdnews24.com on Thursday and an ethnic TV station the day before, the Naogaon MP made certain comments about the party and its leaders, including party president Sheikh Hasina, which created ripples of shock and anger at home and abroad. Jalil was assaulted in Birmingham by some UK Jubo League activists following the interview. Asked what steps would be taken against him, Matia told reporters on Sunday, "AL working committee will hold its meeting on Oct 3. Decision on this matter will also be taken in that meeting." The disgruntled former AL general secretary had said in the interview that he had made a mistake by not going against Hasina on his return to the country to protect his post during the 2007-08 caretaker government regime. Matia, the agriculture minister in the cabinet for a second time, said: "He might have said all these to help the opposition fulfil their agenda, which again I doubt would be achieved." "We have to be careful about the schemers and conspirators, as they are ever agile and activated from time to time at such opportunities." Jalil had said the AL chief had been unjust in excluding four AL leaders including himself from the present cabinet, as a government cannot function with novices and greenhorns only. On that, Matia said, "The cabinet is a team. The prime minister will decide who should be there in the cabinet and it should not be anyone else's headache." "In all countries of the world, it's always the head of the government who makes such decisions." On the induction of new members in the cabinet, she said, "Only one team cannot play all the matches and new blood has to be injected into the system to help it rejuvenate." "And we are already a passing phase. The future leaders have to prepare themselves too." On recasting the AL presidium and the executive council sans the stalwarts, the minister said Hasina had done that quite efficiently after consulting the leaders and workers at all levels. Awami League AL should be proud that it has been able to hold a council successfully and formed a full-scale committee, while many other political parties have not even attempted it, she said. On Jalil's bitterly criticising Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and incumbent general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam bitterly in that interview, Matia said, "I'm not at all worried to hear such things. He has been passing remarks like those for quite some time." "We can't say such things in public which he can. The Awali League can very well absorb one or two jolts like this." By saying such things, Jalil has allowed space for people to question the national polls, even question his own victory in the elections, she said. The AL and its chief had done quiet a lot to accommodate Jalil in the past, she said. He should not forget that Hasina had taken him in as a minister in the technocrat quota., Matia quipped. Jalil said '90 percent' ministers of the incumbent government were 'reformists'--people who propagated the so-called reform moves in the party to sideline Hasina, allegedly with the patronage of the military-installed interim government. Hours earlier, a London-based ethnic TV station had aired excerpts of an interview in which Jalil repeated his trademark tirade against the military intelligence outfit DGFI. Jalil said to bdnews24.com: "Sheikh Hasina ordered me from America to take rest," he said of her pre-election decision, adding he did not protest the leader's command. "My decision was wrong. I should have taken her head-on." During the interview, Jalil spoke of his resignation from party secretary post, party and parliamentary election. Asked to elaborate on his comment on his claim of a "deal" between the AL and the caretaker government on the elections, he said: "It might have happened." He alleged that Awami League had won landslide victory following an understanding with the army backed caretaker goverment. Jalil was elected general secretary in the 19th council of the party in December, 2002. He served as commerce minister in the 1996-2001 Awami League government. He resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on July 21 this year. Jalil had been arrested on May 28, 2007 and he was allowed to go to Singapore for medical treatment on paroled bail. He returned home six months later. bdne
