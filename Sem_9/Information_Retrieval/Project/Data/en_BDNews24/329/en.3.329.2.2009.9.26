 New York, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)--Sheikh Hasina has said her government will fulfill all pledges it made to the minorities before elections, but it would not be right to expect everything at once. During a meeting with the New York chapter leaders of the Hindu, Bouddha and Christian Oikya Parishad, she said on Friday night that all the accumulated problems of the past are being addressed. She said all the demands of the religious minorities would gradually be met, but one at a time. The prime minister is visiting New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and set to address the assembly in Bangla on Saturday. Hasina said her administration has made some headways to meet the demands placed by the religious minorities. She said as part of that effort the government has moved to settle vested property issue, establish Hindu Foundation and remove discriminations against the minorities in administrative recruitment. She said the government wants to probe all alleged incidents of torture and crimes committed to minority people in 2001-2006. "We want to try the perpetrators but we don't want to do anything out of revenge," she said. Hasina also said the verdict of Bangabandhu killing case would be executed. She said that her party would not deviate from its previous role to uphold democracy and fight all forms of discriminations. She asked all to remain vigilant against the rise of communal forces. Referring to February mutiny at the BDR headquarters, the prime minister said opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami were still conspiring against the country. Oikya Parishad leaders Ratan Barua, Rabindranath Sarker, Nobendu Dutta, Mas Dulu Rai, Chandan Sengupta, Shyamol Chakrabarty attended the meeting
