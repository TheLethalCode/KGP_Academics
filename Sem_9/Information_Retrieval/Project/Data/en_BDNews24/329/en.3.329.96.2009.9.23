<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)An woman died at the National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute in Dhaka on Wednesday, allegedly due to negligence of duty and corruption by hospital nurses. Najma Begum, 46, died in ward 5 of the post-operation intensive care unit of the hospital at 8:30am, as nurses sold an expensive injection out in the black market instead of injecting the patient with the same, alleged her relatives. Dr Prashanta Kumar Chandra, surgery consultant of the hospital said, "After Najma was admitted to the hospital with three artery blocks on Sept 14, she underwent a bypass surgery on Sept 16 and since then she was being treated at the ICU." He said the patient died of heart failure due to an attack of the ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT). VT is a tachycardia, or fast heart rhythm, that originates in one of the ventricles of the heart. This is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia because it may lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death, according to doctors. Mohammed Kamaluddin Bhuiyan, Najma's husband, said, "My wife had been complaining for the past 2-3 days that the nurses were not injecting her with the three injections she was supposed to get every day, each of which costs Tk 1,400." "The nurses didn't take any care of my wife. On the other hand, they told her like 'they'd be happy if Najma died'. Ward boys and nurses there do small favours to the patients in exchange for Tk 30-50." He also alleged that the nurses had even slapped Najma on her head, which had been witnessed by other patients. Kamaluddin and his relatives put all these allegations in the form of a written complaint and submitted it to the authorities, he said. Contacted over telephone, Abdul Maleque, a retired brigadier general and chairman of the institute, told bdnews24.com, "I should be extremely sorry if it really happened like that. We surely wouldn't want to hear people complaining while coming to us for relief and comfort." He said the allegations will 'very soon' be investigated and appropriate action taken to redress any grievances. "The allegations are really serious. Be they nurse or ward boys, if found guilty, they'll all be properly dealt with within seven days." bdnew
