 Dhaka, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com)BNP and associate organisations have protested at the authorities not allowing visitors to meet with Khaleda Zia at her Dhaka cantonment residence on Eid day citing security reasons. Retired government secretaries, political leaders and businessmen were turned away on Monday afternoon as the security personnel asked them for permission of the higher authority to visit the opposition chief, they claimed. Student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, youth wing Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal, weavers' wing Jatiyatabadi Tanti dal and peasants Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal in separate statements said the bar manifested the autocratic nature of the government. Former cabinet secretary Abdul Halim told bdnews24.com, "I failed to greet the leader on Eid. The security personnel at the entrance to Shaheed Mainul Road stopped me and asked me if I had permission of the government." Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com, "Some 50 retired officials and businessmen went to greet the leader, but they were not permitted to enter the house. "It's a sad incident." bdnew
