<TEXT>
 PATNA, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian on the payroll of Pakistan's spy agency was arrested in Bihar in possession of important military secrets, police said on Tuesday. The arrest came days before the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to meet in New York to slowly rebuild ties after the Mumbai attacks in November blamed on Pakistan-based militants. Police in Bihar state said they arrested an operative of Islamabad's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI), under the Official Secrets Act and are interrogating him. "We have recovered several secret documents regarding military deployment on the western side of Indo-Pakistan border, army strength deployed there and maps of key installations," Bihar's Inspector General of Police in charge of anti-terrorist operations, S.K. Bhardwaj, said by phone. Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan deteriorated sharply after the Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 people and which New Delhi said must have been carried out with the help of Pakistan state agencies. Islamabad denies any involvement. India suspended formal peace talks since the attacks and has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to do more to crack down on militancy, but the neighbours have since held bilateral meetings on the sidelines of international gatherings.
