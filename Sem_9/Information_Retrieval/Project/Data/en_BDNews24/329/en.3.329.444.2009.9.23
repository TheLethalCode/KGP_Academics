 Dhaka, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com)The government has appointed sports organiser and ruling Awami League MP A H M Mostafa Kamal, better known as Lotus Kamal, the president of Bangladesh Cricket Board. Kamal, a Comilla-9 lawmaker who heads the parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry, will take the charge on Thursday. "I want to work with responsibility. This is not a political platform. We will not do anything on political considerations. Board members will work according to their capabilities," Kamal said to bdnews24.com after the appointment. He also thanked prime minister Sheikh Hasina for giving him the big responsibility. Bangladesh will co-organise the World Cup in 2011 with India and Sri Lanka. Asked about his plans to stage a successful World Cup, he said, "I cannot comment right now. I don't know that much. We will move forward after taking the charge." "I will start my new job tomorrow", Lotus said to reporters in his Nikunja office Wednesday. He replaces lieutenant general Sina Ibne Jamali at the helm of the country's richest sports governing body. Jamali, currently commandant of the National Defence College, was appointed to the top job by the 2007-08 military installed caretaker government. The government has approved three projects worth Tk 1.52 billion to upgrade three of the country's premier sports stadia ahead of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Bangabandhu National Stadium is scheduled to host the opening ceremony. The tournament's first match, slated for Feb 19, will also be held in Bangladesh, although the venue is yet to be finalised. The country will play host to seven other matches, including a quarter-final. Some Tk 310 million has been allocated to renovate and develop Bangabandhu National Stadium. Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur will see Tk 640 million targeted to upgrade the facility to ICC standards. Tk 570 million has been allocated to improve Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Narayangonj, as a back-up venue for the event. bd
