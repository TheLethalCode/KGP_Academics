 BANNU, Pakistan, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taliban suicide bomber crashed his explosives-laden truck into a police station in northwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing six people and wounding 30, police said. The blast destroyed the building and nearby houses and shook the town of Bannu, in the tribal North West Frontier Province. "Six bodies have been recovered. One is policeman, one is a person detained at the police station while four bodies have not yet been identified," Aurangzeb Khan, an official at the town's police control room, told Reuters. He said 30 people, most of them policemen, were wounded. Qari Hussain, a Taliban commander who trains suicide bombers, called Reuters by telephone to take responsibility for the attack and warned of more to come. "The government was taking undue advantage of our silence. We will carry out more such attacks and these will be much more powerful," Hussain said, introducing himself as top spokesman of Pakistani Taliban chief, Hakimullah Mehsud. Hakimullah was appointed chief of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or Taliban movement of Pakistan, a loose alliance of around 13 militant groups, after the death of his predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, in a missile strike by a pilotless U.S. drone in South Waziristan on the Afghan border in August. Militant attacks have tapered off after Mehsud's death but security officials say militants loyal to al Qaeda still pose a serious threat. Thirty-three people were killed in a car-bomb suicide attack near the garrison town of Kohat this month. Bannu is gateway to North Waziristan, a volatile tribal region on the Afghan border and a major sanctuary for al Qaeda and Taliban militants fighting both in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan militants were killed in a missile strike by a U.S. drone aircraft near the house of an Afghan Taliban commander allied to al Qaeda in North Waziristan late on Thursday night. Pakistani forces have also made significant gains against the militants after they launched an offensive in northwestern Swat valley in late April, which helped allay international fears about the stability of the nuclear-armed U.S. ally after militants made advances toward the capital, Islamabad.
