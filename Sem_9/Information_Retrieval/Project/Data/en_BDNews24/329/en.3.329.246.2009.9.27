 Shehabuddin Kislu writes from New York New York, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has tabled a five-pronged set of recommendations to raise a hunger-free world. She put out the recommendations at a seminar on a hunger-free world and global approach to food security on Saturday afternoon at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The member countries expect the UN to provide more effective assistance while they combat floods, droughts and other natural calamities, Hasina said at the seminar hosted by the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Hasina demanded that the UN provide its associate nations with necessary support in coping with the recurrent natural disasters as well as strengthening their health and education services. She acknowledged her full support to the food security proposal developed by the UN Task Force. The prime minister's food autarky recommendations include carrying out operations based on integrated planning, raising multinational funds, keeping financial commitments, ensuring equitable food distribution at national and international levels. She also suggested launching and running food security activities involving different organisations including the private sector and civil society. Bangladesh had attained food autarky in 1996 when the Awami League was running the government, she said and the goal of her government remains the same this time too. Hasina reiterated that it was a high priority of her administration to ensure food security for all. Recurrent droughts, tidal surges, tropical storms caused by the gradually changing climate regime hinder the achievement of our food security goal again and again, she said. The government, she said, however, is doing its best to ensure food security through providing a number of subsidies. Bangladesh has already earned the UN medal for attaining food autarky, she reminded the assembly. Ban in his welcome address said a thousand million people are hungry in today's world, while distribution of food across the globe remains skewed. "Now is the time to demonstrate to food-insecure nations and communities that we want to build on these principles, develop a roadmap for action and secure tangible results." said Ban. The UN chief said this situation is highly deplorable and expressed the hope that the task force will address the issue effectively. Clinton welcomed the gathering at the UN as an opportunity to exchange ideas and join forces against one of today's major challenges, stating that "this is an issue that affects all of us." She said the efforts by the US, which has pledged a minimum of $3.5 billion over the next three years to strengthen agriculture worldwide, will be guided by five principles, among which are addressing the underlying causes of hunger and improving coordination at the country, regional and global levels. She underscored that the issues of global food security and peace keeping are inseparably linked. bdnew
