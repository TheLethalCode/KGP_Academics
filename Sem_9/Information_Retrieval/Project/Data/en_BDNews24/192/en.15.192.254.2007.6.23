<TITLE> Amu picks up on Hasina for Singapore comment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu Saturday launched a diatribe against party chief Sheikh Hasina for her remark that the political situation of Bangladesh cannot be understood staying away in Singapore. "I wonder if one can understand the politics back home, staying in America and London," Amu said on a sarcastic note, pointing to Hasina's stay in the US and London. Earlier in the day, Hasina said: "It won't work if somebody looks at the condition of Bangladesh sitting in Singapore." Amu, who returned home after a long stay in Singapore and commented on Bangladesh politics, was scheduled to fly back to the city-state Saturday. Amu said: "Sheikh Hasina has harmed herself and the party with her statements." The AL leader, who led a group of party colleagues in making a so-called reform proposal, spoke to a horde of reporters at his Eskaton home after a meeting with Hasina at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. On his discussion with Hasina, Amu said: "We have told her that she should not have given the statements in the US." "In reply Sheikh Hasina said she did so as the government filed a case against her. "We told her that she had made the comments before the case was filed," Amu said. Amu and other leaders told Hasina that the fatwa deal with Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish was a misstep, he said. "And announcing the fall of BNP-Jamaat alliance by April 30 amounts to a conspiracy," Amu said. "No government can be pulled down this way." "The Awami League is a democratic institution. Fixing a deadline means being part of a conspiracy. We don't support it. Movement is a process. Movement cannot succeed by fixing a date," Amu told reporters. On the fatwa deal, Amu quoted Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil as saying: "I was asked to go there and I did. I was told to sign the deal and I did. And I returned." Amu said: "The plan for the agreement was not discussed at the party forum. We protested it at a 14-party meeting." Asked if senior leaders were satisfied with what Hasina said in her explanation, Amu said, "No." Amu ruled out any scope for the Awami League getting divided over a reform proposal. He said all party leaders and workers from top down were in favour of reforms. bdnews
