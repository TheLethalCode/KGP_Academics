<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said he would rethink a proposal to cut the proposed duty burden on import of raw materials and capital machinery for the textile sector. "We still have some days to finalise the budget for the coming fiscal year. We'll try to consider the issue," Islam told reporters after a meeting with the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) at the planning ministry. BTMA president Abdul Hai Sarker led the business delegation that asked the adviser to withdraw the proposed 10 percent import duty on import of textile machinery. However, the adviser said nothing concrete on whether he was going to withdraw the duty hike proposal. Sarker said the proposed duty structure was likely to weaken the local textile industry's competitiveness by giving advantages to its competitors China, India and Pakistan. He said some of Bangladesh's competitors manufacture textile machinery. "The proposed duty structure will discourage further investment in the textile sector," the BTMA president said. Sarker said that the move would also put off employment generation and poverty reduction initiatives of the government. The BTMA also demanded continuation of tax holiday facility up to 2012. The facility for industries outside the export processing zones end June 30, 2008. BTMA is a national trade organisation that represents yarn and fabric manufacturers and textile product processors under the private sector. Currently, the BTMA has 935 members. Of them, 263 are spinning (yarn), 458 weaving (fabric) and 158 dyeing-printing-finishing units. Over $3.35 billion has been invested in the sector that has created employment for about 3.5 million people, according to BTMA. The BTMA president said that they fulfill 100 percent demand of the domestic fabric and yarn requirement, and 50 percent of the cotton woven fabric demand of the export- oriented garments sub-sector. bd
