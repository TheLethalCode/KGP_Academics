 LONDON, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's imminent signing of Arsenal's Thierry Henry is set to add one of the most prolific forwards in world football to their already impressive attack. A year after Henry turned down the Catalan club, following Arsenal's defeat by them in the Champions League final in Paris, the popular France striker this time is about to pack his bags. Clearly unhappy at the abrupt departure in April of director David Dein over a row about U.S. investor Stan Kroenke, Henry's impending departure comes as a body blow to the club whose success was based on the French forward's prodigious talent. Top scorer in four of the five Premier League seasons from 2001-2006 before being sidelined by injury last term, Henry has great pace, superb dribbling skills and a fearsome shot. Along with being a cool finisher in the penalty area, Henry's big advantage over other top strikers such as Real Madrid's Ruud van Nistelrooy or AC Milan's Filippo Inzaghi is that he is also a superb goalmaker for his team mates.

Under Wenger's tutelage, Henry switched from being a winger to an all-round central striker, transforming his club career. Arsenal did the league and FA Cup Double in 2002, won the FA Cup in 2003, made history in the modern era by going unbeaten in another league triumph in 2004 and then lifted the FA Cup again in 2005, though Henry missed that final through injury. Arsenal's disappointment over the defeat by Barca in Paris was soon tempered by Henry pledging his future to the club, saying: "This is my last contract. It is where I belong." Now Barca will be hoping Henry can lead their campaign to regain the La Liga title and secure the only major honour missing from his own CV -- a Champions League winners' meda
