<TITLE> Engage political parties in reforms: Butenis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing US ambassador Patricia Butenis says she hopes Bangladesh will have a new democratic government by next year and a better climate for foreign investment inflows. But Butenis, speaking on a state-run BTV programme Friday evening, cautioned: "We've got a way to go." She said political parties must be allowed a role in the current process of reforming political and electoral institutions. Reforms were a must, she said but warned they wouldn't be possible "without engaging the political parties". "No one has accused majority of the membership (of a political party) of being corrupt," Butenis said in a pre-recorded interview on Shomoyer Kotha programme. Her clear emphasis was on an early lifting of the ban on politics. "Wouldn't it be better to make them partners in this process?" she told interviewer Syed Munir Khasru. "Resolving of the issue of leadership" was also possible "if all the parties talk together". Butenis, who is departing Dhaka Saturday to take up her new assignment in the US mission in Baghdad, described Bangladeshis as "warm, friendly and hospitable". But she jokingly said Bangladeshis also at times tended to be "conspiratorial". The outgoing envoy denied the United States having any "secret agenda" in Bangladesh. She assured Bangladesh of easing the visa procedures for "true and genuine" Bangladeshi applicants. She continued with her characteristic attack on the Bangladeshi media that the ambassador often accused of attributing to her statements she had never made or activities she had never undertaken. But she made it clear that the solution was not to shut them up but to help them learn and improve. Butenis described the transition from democracy to a state of emergency as 'difficult time'. She said a lot of people were relieved when the state of emergency was imposed. Answering a question on interference, she said: "Political problems in Bangladesh are not simple. One problem goes into another. Obviously you cannot solve all the problems in 18 months." She however appreciated the government's efforts to bring changes to people's attitude which she described as positive. She said the best way to solve the problems was to have an elected government. On having assistance from the US for the elections, Butenis said, "We are working with the government and ready to offer any sort of funding that may be required." The US government is working with the Election Commission but not "dictating" it. On the critical turning point in national politics, she said: "I don't know how one can proceed in political reforms by keeping politicians in the box. Reform must be done taking them on board as partners. "When we talk about reforms in politics we are talking about leadership that should go way forward. By holding the politicians back you are denying their participation. "It was very frustrating when the political leadership failed to agree on selecting a leader for the caretaker government. I tried to promote dialogue on this issue but I really didn't think they were serious." EDUCATION, TRADE AND MEDIA Butenis said she felt embarrassed when visa applications were turned down for students. "We are constantly working to gain back the number of visas issued to students before 9/11." There are now restrictions and strict rules, however. "We certainly want to invite talented Bangladeshi students. But when we review applications we tend to select only the genuine students because often students once in the US stay back." There were a record number of applications for US Diversification Visa (DV) from Bangladesh. "That makes us feel happy," she said. On trade issues, Butenis said Bangladesh should diversify exports to the US. She said Bangladesh is a country with tremendous potential that encourages foreign investment. She also talked about the media issues and said Bangladesh does not get sustained coverage in the US. "(But) Bangladesh has come a long way from its previous images." Disaster response, education coverage and the Nobel peace prize were positive issues that got coverage in the US, she said. Butenis suggested that Bangladesh media should do more investigative reporting about human-rights issues. She cited journalists being picked up in the middle of the night as an example of human-rights violation. "Such acts are unfair and give wrong images of Bangladesh. You need a more responsible and balanced media." GOODBYE Butenis said she would miss Bangladeshi culture and her favourite fruit here: mango. She described Bangladesh as a beautiful place for tourism and said the country could be a Mecca for eco-tourism. Finally she said people of Bangladesh should not give up hope. bdnews24.com/nh/mar/f
