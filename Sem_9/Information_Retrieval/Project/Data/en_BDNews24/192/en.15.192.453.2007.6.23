 GUWAHATI, India, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb exploded near a crowded bus stand in the restive northeastern Indian state of Assam on Saturday, killing four people hours before the opening of an international athletics meeting, police said. More than 200 athletes and officials from 19 Asian countries have gathered in Guwahati, the state's main city, to participate in a grand prix organised by the Asian Athletics Association. No athletes were hurt in the blast, which injured a dozen people. "The victims were mostly vegetable vendors and traders. We are yet to identify the four dead bodies," a senior police officer told Reuters. The separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) -- fighting for independence for the oil- and tea-rich state of 26 million people -- is suspected to be behind the blast. ULFA had threatened to disrupt the National Games, India's leading sporting event, held in the state in February. Though the outfit has issued no specific threat against the Asian meet, it says such events are organised by New Delhi to reinforce its claim that Assam is an integral part of India. Separatist violence has killed more than 20,000 people in Assam since 1979. The officer said the latest bomb was hidden among vegetable baskets near a crowded bus stand, where farmers from nearby villages arrive every morning to sell their produce.
