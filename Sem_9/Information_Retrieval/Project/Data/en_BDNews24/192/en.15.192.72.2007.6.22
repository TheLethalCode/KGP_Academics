 JERUSALEM, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israelis on Friday played down expectations for next week's summit between Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, despite Olmert's pledge on Thursday to forge a "new beginning". Olmert is due to meet the Palestinian leader, whose secular Fatah forces lost control to the Islamist Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip a week ago, in Egypt on Monday. Fatah continues to hold sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but some question whether Abbas remains strong enough to engage in peace talks with Israel. Hamas, which refuses to recognise the Jewish state, remains in charge in Gaza and says it, not Abbas's emergency cabinet, is the legitimate government. "Forgive me for being honest, but I think Mahmoud Abbas has shown the strength he does not have to lead his people," said Moishe Smith, president of powerful pro-Israel Bnai Brith International, a group based in North America. Speaking to Reuters in Jerusalem after talks with Israeli leaders, Smith questioned whether Israel and Washington should "prop up" Abbas as a peace partner, since his popularity among Palestinians was uncertain. A poll published this week gave Abbas an approval rating of just 36 percent. Smith, among a group of Jewish leaders consulted by U.S. President George W. Bush, said Israel and Washington should "leave it for the moment" rather than push for negotiations before the Fatah-Hamas leadership battle is finally decided. Hamas, which won a parliamentary election last year, has criticised the planned summit, saying it would not benefit the Palestinians and accusing Abbas of staging a "coup". Abbas has in turn ruled out any dialogue with the Islamists, and accused Hamas this week of seeking to kill him. Some in Israel thought the summit could score a diplomatic breakthrough, but only if Olmert -- whose popularity has also plummeted since last year's much-criticised war in Lebanon -- offered serious steps to support Abbas, such as providing more weapons and a solid offer to negotiate for a Palestinian state. "Israeli cabinet ministers err when they say time and again that Abbas isn't a partner for peace, and are stupid to call him weak," columnist Yoel Marcus wrote in the Haaretz newspaper. Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, infrastructures minister in Olmert's cabinet, said it was too soon to discuss a revival of peace negotiations for a Palestinian state last convened in 2001. "I don't even dream of seeing a peace process very soon," Ben-Eliezer told Israel's Army Radio. "I only dream about seeing some quiet." The cabinet minister seemed to support arming Abbas better. "The real nuclear bomb is there and not in Iran," he said, referring to the threat of continued Hamas control over Gaza. Israeli rightists have lobbied strongly against providing more arms to Abbas's forces, maintaining that these guns could also be fired at Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Leftist lawmaker Ran Cohen said weapons alone would not ensure Abbas's political survival in the West Bank. "Unless (Abbas) comes up with a political solution for the Palestinian people, the extremists will defeat him in the end," Cohen said, alluding to Hamas. Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said in anticipation of the talks it was "most important we revive a meaningful peace process" that leads to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian confli
