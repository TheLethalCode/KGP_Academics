 Chittagong, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives of slain BNP leader and businessman Jamaluddin Chowdhury Friday welcomed the arrest of former BNP lawmaker Sarwar Jamal Nizam. They said they now can expect justice. "All obstacles to a proper trial for the killing have been removed with his arrest," Jamaluddin's widowed wife Nazma Akter Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "We ran door to door for the last four years seeking justice. We appealed to the highest authorities of the then government but did not get justice. It is now time to investigate the case properly," she added. She demanded his interrogation in the Jamaluddin killing case. Jamaluddin was kidnapped from Chandgaon area in Chittagong on July 24, 2003 and later killed. RAB arrested Sarwar Jamal Nizam, who was elected MP from Chittagong-12 constituency, early Friday. Jamaluddin's relatives have long been accusing Nizam of influencing the case to save the killers. They alleged Nizam's brother Maruf Nizam masterminded the killing. Nazma said she did not see any more obstacles to a proper trial of the killing. She believed only a non-political government like the interim government can bring her husband's killers to justice. She said Nizam knew who had killed her husband and where his brother Maruf Nizam was hiding. Nazma once more accused former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar of taking bribe to free the killers of the charges. The police on July 10, 2006 pressed charges against 16 people in the Jamaluddin murder case. But Jamaluddin's relatives rejected the chargesheet and the incident was reinvestigated by the Criminal Investigation Department. CID assistant superintendent of police Hamidul Haque gave a supplementary chargesheet on October 10 that year. Jamaluddin's family again rejected it as Sarwar Jamal Nizam and Maruf Nizam were not on the chargesheet. The plaintiff appealed for further investigation into the case, but the High Court stayed the reinvestigation in line with an appeal of Maruf Nizam, according to his lawyer Fouzul Amin Chowdhury. Jamaluddin's son Chowdhury Forman Reza Liton said they would file a graft case against Lutfozzaman Babar, Sarwar and Maruf Nizam, and former state minister Shahjahan Omar for taking bribe from the killers and influencing the case. bdnews24.
