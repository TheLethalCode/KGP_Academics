<TITLE> Duty spike will cut profits, not hit industry: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said the planned spike in duty on capital machinery to 10 percent from 5 percent would reduce only profit margins, not hit the local industry. It would not affect the industry as life expectancy of a machine is at least 10 years, meaning the duty is 1 percent a year, he said. "We have to think also about the interests of the intermediate goods producers," Azizul said at a post-budget discussion organised by the Economic Reporters' Forum (ERF). Bangladesh's first online newspaper bdnews24.com sponsored the programme at the CIRDAP auditorium in the city. He made the remarks when former ministers and lawmakers asked him to rethink the proposed spike in duty on import of raw materials, capital machinery and intermediate goods. The politicians feared the hike, if implemented, would derail the economy. Former ministers Tofail Ahmed and MK Anwar, former lawmakers Dr Abdur Razzak, Faruk Khan, Rashed Khan Menon, Jahiruddin Swapon and GM Quader took part in the discussion. ERF president Zakaria Kajal chaired the discussion. Azizul proposed to enhance the import duty on raw materials and capital machinery from 5 percent to 10 percent and for intermediate goods to 12 percent from 10 percent in the budget for FY 2007-08. "The caretaker government should not increase the duty on raw materials and machineries," former commerce and industry minister and Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed said. He said a hike in prices of raw materials hit domestic producers had and spark a decline in finished goods. Former agriculture minister and BNP leader MK Anwar said an increased duty would raise the production cost of local industries and as a result, they will lose out to foreign competitors. "If local industries are affected, revenue collections will also be affected," Anwar told the discussion. He said the proposal would enhance prices of about 1,200 industrial raw materials. Other politicians at the discussion echoed the two former ministers. Azizul disagreed with them. He, however, said the government would consider the issue before finalising the budget. On the jute industry, the adviser said it is not viable under the existing administrative capacity of the public sector. He also criticised industrialists for not raising funds from what he said was a vibrant capital market. bd
