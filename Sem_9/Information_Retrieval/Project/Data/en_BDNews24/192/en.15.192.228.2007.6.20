 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)-- The Election Commission has sought the help of nongovernmental organisations to bring voters to the camps for registration. The appeal came at a views-exchange meeting of the Election Working Group with EC members at the EC secretariat Wednesday. The Election Working Group is a platform of more than 40 NGOs. The meeting was presided over by chief election commissioner, ATM Shamsul Huda. After the meeting the CEC told reporters: "NGO cooperation has been sought to inspire people and bring them to the camps for voter and national IDs with photographs." "They are very interested to be a part of the process with the EC. These NGOs also have previous election experience." Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah, chief of Jatiya Nirbachon Parjabekkhan Parishad, said, "NGOs will be giving all kinds of assistance to inspire people to vote." The EWC would provide the EC with a list, which will include details of individual working zones, and the role and responsibilities of each NGO. The EC would then sign separate deals with each of them, adding some conditions. The project would be funded by six international donor agencies, the CEC said. He said that the tentative deadline for launching the final voter-list project in Rajshahi was July 15. "But before that we would go for media campaign. We would ask the mobile phone companies to help us." Taleya Rahman, chief of DemocracyWatch and resident representative of the Asia Foundation, also expressed their desire to help the commission. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain and Sakhawat Hossain were also present at the meeting. bdnews
