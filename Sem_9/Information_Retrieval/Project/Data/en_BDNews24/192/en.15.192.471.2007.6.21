 By Linda Sieg TOKYO (Reuters) - The US envoy to nuclear talks with North Korea arrived in Pyongyang on Thursday to discuss the next steps under a disarmament deal, a surprise trip analysts said showed both sides were eager for swift progress. US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said before leaving that six-country talks on the deal, under which the impoverished communist country would receive hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, were likely to resume in early July. But he said during talks in Tokyo that Pyongyang must keep the promise it made in February to shut down a nuclear reactor. "We have to catch up on some of the timelines, because we really fell behind this spring. I think we have to do everything we can do to accelerate the timelines," Hill told reporters. Hill is the most senior State Department official to visit North Korea since October 2002, when envoy James Kelly confronted Pyongyang with evidence that Washington said pointed to a covert uranium enrichment program. China's Xinhua news agency said Hill had arrived in the North Korean capital. He will stay in Pyongyang through Friday and meet his North Korean counterpart in the nuclear talks, Vice Foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan, a U.S. State Department spokesman said. "His visit is part of a round of consultations with the six-party counterparts to move the six-party process forward," the spokesman said in Washington. SEEKING REWARDS Reclusive North Korea, which conducted its first nuclear test last October, said on Saturday it would re-admit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as required under the accord clinched in Beijing on February 13. The inspectors are due to arrive in Pyongyang next week. That decision followed signs that most of the $25 million in North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank for nearly two years was making its way back to the North. An unidentified North Korean diplomatic source, quoted by Russia's Interfax news agency on Monday, said the North would seal the reactor at Yongbyon, about 100 km (60 miles) north of Pyongyang, in the second half of July. Diplomatic analysts said both Washington and Pyongyang were eager to see speedy results in the nuclear disarmament talks. Pyongyang is keen to receive energy aid promised under the February deal, see trade sanctions imposed after its nuclear test lifted, and be removed from Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism, said Noriyuki Suzuki, chief analyst at Tokyo-based Radiopress, which monitors North Korean media. "North Korea wants to normalize ties with the United States and get what it can get. They want to pick up the pace," he said. Washington is also eager for results from the disarmament talks before George W Bush's presidency ends, analysts said. "The United States had been wanting to speed up the process and solve the issue during the Bush administration," said Lee Jong-won, a professor at Tokyo's Rikkyo University. China has hosted previous rounds of the talks that also bring together the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia.
