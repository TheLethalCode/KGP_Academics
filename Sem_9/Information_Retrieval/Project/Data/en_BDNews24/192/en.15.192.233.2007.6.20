<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four-times winner Roger Federer was named top seed for the Wimbledon championships with French Open holder Rafael Nadal favourite to meet him in a rematch of last year's final. American Andy Roddick, twice a runner-up at Wimbledon, was third in the seeding announced on Wednesday for the championships starting next week. Below them, the All England Club has again used players' grasscourt results in the last two years to come up with their top 32, unlike the other grand slams where they are decided purely on world rankings in the men's and women's singles. Czech Tomas Berdych is the chief beneficiary of the unique system, having been seeded seven in the men's event compared to a world ranking of 11. The leading women's seeds go according to ranking with world number one Justine Henin, fresh from clinching a hat-trick of French Open titles, at the top. The world's best on clay, she is looking for her first Wimbledon triumph. Last year's women's winner Amelie Mauresmo is fourth seed, behind 2004 champion Maria Sharapova and in-form Serb Jelena Jankovic. Australian Open champion Serena Williams, twice a Wimbledon winner in 2002 and 2003, is the seventh seed, in accordance with her ranking. Her sister Venus, who won the third of her titles in 2005, has suffered injury woes this year and is seeded 24th. Russian world men's number four Nikolay Davydenko drops to sixth in the seeding, meaning Serbia's Novak Djokovic and hard-hitting Chilean Fernando Gonzalez are bumped up to fourth and fifth respectively. World number seven Tommy Robredo finds himself down at 11th because of his poor record on grass. Marcos Baghdatis, a semi-finalist last year, is seeded 10th, six places higher than his world ranking. Likewise, veteran Swede Jonas Bjorkman finds himself seeded 20th, compared to a world ranking of 31, after his surprise last-four run in 2006. Britain's Andy Murray has been seeded at number eight but his participation in the tournament hangs in the balance as he works on his fitness following a wrist injury. Argentine Guillermo Canas, who has worked his way back into the top 20 at 17th following a doping ban, is seeded 23rd, one place above compatriot David Nalbandian, who has failed to follow up on grass on his final appearance in 2002. Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, who beat Nalbandian in the 2002 final, is seeded 16th, three places higher than his world ranking
