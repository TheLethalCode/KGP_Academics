 Colombo, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka A raced to 170 for 4 in just 36.3 overs before rain caused play to be abandoned on the final day of their game against the Bangladeshis at the Colts Cricket Club ground in Colombo. After the Bangladeshis declared on their overnight score of 245 for 8, the Sri Lankan openers, Michael Vandort and Mahela Udawatte, put up a brisk 61-run partnership. Vandort celebrated his recall to the national team with an aggressive knock of 38, including five boundaries, before Syed Rasel had him caught behind. The loss of Vandort didn't slow down Udawatte, who helped himself to a run-a-ball half century. He reached the milestone in style by hitting Abdur Razzak for a six and a four off consecutive deliveries. However, Razzak got his revenge as he bowled Udawatte in the same over. Three overs later, Shakib al Hasan dismissed former Test player Thilan Samaraweera leaving two new batsmen at the crease. After this, the Bangladeshi spinners managed to keep the Sri Lankans quiet until rain curtailed play for the second consecutive day. Mohammad Sharif was the most impressive Bangladeshi bowler on display and managed to stifle the Sri Lankans when they were on the attack. The opening pair of Rasel and Shahadat Hossain looked toothless against the rampaging Sri Lankan top order. The Bangladeshis will be disappointed by the amount of time lost due to rain, as they wanted to use this game to gauge their backup bowling for the upcoming Test series. The first Test starts on Monday at the Sinhalese Sports club ground in Colomb
