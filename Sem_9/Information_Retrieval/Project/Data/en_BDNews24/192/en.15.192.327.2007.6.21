 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - Syed Al Masum scored his first hat-trick in the 27th National Hockey Championships. Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) overwhelmed Dinajpur DSA 11-1 in their match at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Thursday. Masum scored four goals in total for BKSP while Zahid Bin Taleb and Wajid Kumar Das netted two goals apiece. Shamsul Alam Sujan, MA Sajjad and Sheikh Mohammad Nannu each scored one goal for the victors. Toufiquddin found the back of the net for Dinajpur's single successful attack of the game, however this was small consolation for the losers as they now exit the Championship after losing their second Group B match. In the same group, Rajshahi Division tasted their second win with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Chittagong Division at the same venue. Raju Sarkar and Bappi Kumar scored the winners while Monirul Alam Sumon netted for the losers. In Group A match, Chittagong DSA defeated Joypurhat DSA 5-1 after taking a 3-1 lead in the first half, while Bangladesh Air Force beat Bangladesh Police 4-2 after a commanding performance in the first half left them 3-1 ahead in their Group C match.
