 Thursday, June 21, 2007, New Delhi, (bdnews24.com/ndtv)--Pratibha Patil has met President APJ Abdul Kalam to submit her resignation as Rajasthan Governor, paving the way for her presidential bid. But a day after President Kalam threw his hat in the ring, there were strong criticism from the UPA. President Kalam's willingness to contest for a second term if victory is certain has drawn criticism from the UPA. The Congress has criticised President Kalam for his last minute change of heart on running for a second term. It said his statement on Wednesday was unfortunate. In a related development, the CPI(M) has rejected the UNPA's proposal to support President Kalam for a second term. Earlier, leaders of the UNPA, who are pushing for a second term for Kalam, met with CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat on Thursday. In a statement, the CPM Politburo said that ''Prakash Karat informed the UNPA leaders that the CPI(M) has already decided to extend its support to the UPA nominee Pratibha Patil, and in view of this, the matter cannot be considered.'' ''The UNPA leaders had come to meet us. They wanted us to consider Kalam as a presidential candidate. But we informed them that we had officially rejected Kalam and it was too late for us to reconsider it,'' said Sitaram Yechury, Politburo Member, CPI(M). Third Front leaders also met with CPI leader AB Bardhan, and according to reports, the CPI has also rejected their proposal to support Kalam. President Kalam told Third Front leaders on Wednesday that he would consider it if there was certainty of his victory. On his part, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, a key partner of the UPA, has said that they always wanted a candidate with a political background and that Pratibha Patil has the full support of the NCP. ''The NCP stands behind Pratibha Patil. It is too late to consider President Kalam's nomination,'' said Sharad Pawar, NCP Chief. More meetings Meanwhile, senior UNPA leaders including TDP's Chandrababu Naidu and the SP's Mulayam Singh Yadav will be holding meetings with other leaders later in the day to pursue their agenda of a second term for Kalam. The NDA, which has already named Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat as its candidate, will also hold a separate meeting at former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's residence. All these developments come after UNPA leaders met President Kalam on Wednesday to persuade him for a second term. The president reacted by saying that he was ready for a second term if there was certainty. Votes tally However, considering the current scenario, if everyone votes along party lines, the votes are lined up as follows. The UNPA votes, which are already committed for Kalam, add up to 1,06,281 votes. If the NDA throws its weight behind Kalam, and that doesn't seem likely at present, that's another 3,54,689 votes. This would mean a total of some 4,60,970 votes. But the Congress-Left combine, which has proposed Pratibha Patil for President, already controls a majority - a total of around 5,70,000 votes. So for Kalam to win, he will have to get about 55,000 votes from legislators that are part of the UPA-Left combi
