 Kabul, June, 21 (bdnews24.com/BBC) The Taleban in Afghanistan are changing their tactics to mount more attacks on the capital, Kabul, a spokesman for the militant group has told the BBC. The spokesman, Zabiyullah Mujahed, said Taleban were recovering after Nato had infiltrated the group and killed some of its leaders. But more people were volunteering to carry out suicide bombings, he said. A police bus in Kabul was bombed on Sunday killing up to 35 people, in the deadliest attack there since 2001.
