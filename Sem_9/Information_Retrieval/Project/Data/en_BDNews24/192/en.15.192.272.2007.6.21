<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed Thursday said it was better to be run by an army-backed caretaker government than going back to the pre-January 11 days. Tofail said the current caretaker government was the result of the absolute failure of politicians and a denial of the fact would amount to cheating people. The AL leader made the remark in presence of an adviser of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led emergency government for the first time since the military-backed administration took office on Jan. 12. "I think the finance adviser sitting beside me had no wish to become an adviser, situation forced him," the commerce and industry minister in Sheikh Hasina's 1996- 2001 cabinet told a post-budget discussion. The Economic Reporters' Forum organised the discussion at the CIRDAP auditorium, which was sponsored by Bangladesh's first online newspaper bdnews24.com . "I believe the chief adviser also never thought of his current role in the status of a prime minister." The AL leader hailed the interim government for its actions in the post-January 11 situation. "This government is really a neutral government. Their intentions are also good. Whatever the caretaker administrators are doing they are doing for the greater good of the nation." There are lots of successes of the present caretaker government, he said, adding they are playing a historical role. Tofail said it was clear what would happen in the Jan. 22 elections. He praised the finance adviser for presenting a full-fledged budget and taking reactions and comments on it. bd
