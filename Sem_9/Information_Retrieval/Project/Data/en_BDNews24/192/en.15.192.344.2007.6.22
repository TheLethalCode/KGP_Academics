<TITLE> Italian FA clear Inter in spying case but Vieri unhappy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, June 22 (bdnbews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan have been cleared of allegations they spied on players and a referee and the file on the case has been closed, the disciplinary committee of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced on Friday. Former Inter strikers Christian Vieri and Ronaldo were among those allegedly spied on by the club, as well as former Italian referee Massimo De Santis, who was found guilty of attempting to influence the results of games in last year's Serie A match-fixing scandal. The FIGC's decision to close the case did not spell the end of the controversy, however. Vieri is currently pursuing a separate civil action against his former club and Telecom Italia for a total of 21 million euros in damages. "I'm very surprised they decided to close the case. It doesn't seem to me that they examined the evidence very closely," Vieri's lawyer Danilo Buongiorno told Reuters. A statement on the FIGC's Web site (www.figc.it) on Friday said however: "No facts of relevance to the disciplinary committee had emerged from the probe." The investigation began last September in response to claims that during 2002 Inter employed a firm of private investigators with links to telecommunications giant Telecom Italia to monitor the movements and intercept the phone calls of some of its star players. If found guilty by the FIGC, Inter could have faced a fine or a points penalty for breaching the sports rules governing fair conduct.
