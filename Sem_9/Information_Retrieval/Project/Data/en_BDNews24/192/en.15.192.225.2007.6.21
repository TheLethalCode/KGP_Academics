 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks surged to a new high Thursday as optimism about good business pulled up the shares of bigwigs in power, textiles and pharmaceuticals. Power stocks moved up on anticipation of good earnings as the government is set to approve the installation of some small power plants. Pharmaceuticals, mutual funds and banking closed mixed. Insurance stocks finished almost flat amid erratic rise in the shares Popular Life Insurance, Federal Insurance and Fareast Islami Life Insurance. "This rising trend looks unhealthy. Prices of many issues are getting distanced from their fundamentals," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of a brokerage, Imtiyaz Husain Securities. Profit-taking led cement stocks down. The benchmark DGEN or general index which crossed the 2100 mark amid a rally until midday finally added 12.55 points or 0.60 percent to 2087.10, a new high in bourses history. The DSI or all-share price index finished at 1706.48, up 10.46 points or 0.61 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index advanced 8.68 points or 0.46 percent to 1858.02. Selling pressure in the second half of trading, however, left 100 issues in the loser pavilion. A total of 84 issues gained and 17 remained stable. Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh, however, said: "The sentiment is positive. Investors are betting high on anticipation ahead of good half yearly disclosures from firms." Buoyed by turnover at Tk 1.51 billion and a rise in prices, market capitalisation on the DSE touched a record high of Tk 462.10 billion. Turnover on the DSE was Tk 1.75 billion. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also ended buoyant amid a surge in turnover at Tk 336.39 million Thursday from Tk 224.11 million the previous day. But losers beat gainers 52 to 43 while six issues held steady. On the DSE, turnover leader Square Textile gained 5.69 percent to Tk 115. It secured Tk 101.45 million followed by Power Grid Company of Bangladesh at Tk 84.85 million. Power Grid added 0.77 percent to Tk 587.25. Square Pharma, adding 0.75 percent, ended at Tk 3866.5.
