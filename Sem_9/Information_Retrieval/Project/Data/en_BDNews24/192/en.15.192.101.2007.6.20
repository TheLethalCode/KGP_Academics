 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Wednesday said the party would be reformed in line with the opinions of all leaders and workers. The process will take off once the ban on indoor politics is lifted, Khaleda told reporters after visiting BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan at BIRDEM hospital. "I've already asked (senior leaders) to make a reform proposal," the BNP chief said. On if she had talks with BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan on the issue, Khaleda said: "I've discussed it with everybody." Khaleda said the party would be reformed for the welfare of people and the country. "I always endorse reforms to the party. BNP carried out reforms at different levels in the government in the interest of people. It established a parliamentary system instead of presidential government." "Every leader and activist of the party wants reforms. Reforms won't be made for a handful of people," the former prime minister said. BNP leader Nazrul Islam Khan has been suffering from diabetes. Khaleda later went to Ibne Sina Hospital to visit Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini, chairman of a faction of Islami Oikya Jote, a four-party coalition partner. bdnew
