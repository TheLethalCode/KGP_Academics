 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said that it was up to the Saudi prince to rescue the Rupali bank sale from difficulty. "The ball is in his court, not the Bangladesh government's," he said. The adviser made his remarks following queries on the fate of the bank's sale to would-be owner Prince Bandar Bin Mohammad Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud. The bank's sale is now uncertain, following the potential buyer's failure to communicate with the Privatisation Commission (PC), the government arm for selling and privatising state-owned enterprises, for the last two months. Prince Bandar won a purchase bid for 67.26 percent of the government's stake in the bank last September for $330 million. In February this year the go-ahead was given for the purchase of a further 26 percent of the shares for $128 million. The remaining 6.74 percent will stay in the private sector. The PC initiated the sale of Rupali Bank through an international tender in May 2006. This decision follows guidelines from the Bank Modernisation and Enterprise Growth Project, funded by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Prince Bandar prevailed over seven other bidders. However there have been so many hitches in the negotiations that the handover now seems uncertain. Finance ministry officials claimed the prospective owner of Rupali started adding conditions soon after winning the bid. "Initially, the conditions focused on only financial matters. However gradually the list of conditions increased, becoming critical at the last moment," a senior finance ministry official told bdnews24.com Wednesday, preferring anonymity. The prince has sought permission to appoint up to 300 foreign management employees, including advisers and trainers who would be exempt from income tax. He further requested the government to relax laws on how many expatriate directors can be employed at the bank and foreign individual ownership regulations. Bandar also demanded a remittance of up to 90 percent of their salary. Blocked loans, voluntary retirement schemes and non-performing loans of the state owned enterprise were the major issues needing attention before handing over of the bank. bdnew
