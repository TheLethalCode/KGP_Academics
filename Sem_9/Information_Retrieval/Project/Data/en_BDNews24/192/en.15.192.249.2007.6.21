<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  'Citizen Kane,' Orson Welles' powerful portrait of an unscrupulous media baron, beat back an assault from 'The Godfather,' on Wednesday to retain its title as the greatest American film. Film critics, historians and experts voted 'Kane' as the top US film for the second time in a decade in a poll conducted by the American Film Institute. The results were revealed in a three-hour CBS special '100 Years, 100 Movies, 10th Anniversary Edition.' 'The Godfather,' which ranked third in the original poll of 100 great films a decade ago. moved up a notch to second place while 'Casablanca' slipped to number three. Also in the top 10 were a surprising 'Raging Bull' at number four, up 20 places from a decade ago. 'Singin' in the Rain' was in fifth place, 'Gone With The Wind' was sixth followed by 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Schindler's List,' 'Vertigo' and 'The Wizard of Oz.' 'Vertigo,' the Hitchcock film starring James Stewart, rose to 9th place after placing 61st in the original poll.

But Griffith's racist 1915 film 'Birth of a Nation' fell off the list entirely because of its now unpopular ideology, despite its history of technical innovations. Of the 43 newly eligible films released from 1996 to 2006, only 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' (50), 'Saving Private Ryan' (71), 'Titanic' (83) and 'The Sixth Sense' (89) made the cut. Other new additions to the list include 'Cabaret' (63), 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' (67), 'The Shawshank Redemption' (72), 'All The President's Men' (77), 'Spartacus' (81) and 'A Night at the Opera' (85). Among those films that did not make the list were: 'Fantasia,' 'Doctor Zhivago,' 'Birth of a Nation,' 'The Jazz Singer,' My Fair Lady,' 'From Here to Eternity' and 'An American in Paris.' AFI film historian Pat Hansen said it seemed that musicals took the biggest hit. "Musicals seemed out of favor and were replaced by more popular films like 'Titanic' and 'Saving Private Ryan'," she sa
