<TEXT>
 Dhaka 20, June (bdnews24.com)  Two groups of agitated garments workers Wednesday rampaged through a factory and blockaded a highway in Pallabi and Gazipur. Demanding two month's overdue wages, about 400 frustrated workers in Pallabi rampaged through the 'Saleha Garments' factory owned by former state minister Professor Redwan Ahmed. Pallabi police station sub inspector Faruk Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "Angry workers gathered in front of the factory on Milk Vita Road around 12:30 pm." At Gazipur's Naljani, over 150 people gathered and held an angry demonstration in front of 'A & A' garments factory after several days of unmet demands, police sources said. Later they placed blockades on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway which they removed only after the owners promised to pay their salaries. In both cases the joint forces and RAB were required to restore order. They were summoned to the Pallabi factory after a policeman was injured trying to stop the mob from throwing stones at the factory. After a long meeting with the workers Wednesday in the presence of BGMEA leaders the management of Saleha Garments paid a portion of the workers' salaries promising complete payment by July 20. The director of the 'A & A' factory said the delay in payment of wages is due to a decrease in export orders. No complaints were filed in either of the cases. bdnews24
