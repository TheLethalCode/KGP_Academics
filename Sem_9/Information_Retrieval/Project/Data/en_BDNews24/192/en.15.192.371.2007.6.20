<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court will hand down the verdict on a narcotics case against former communications minister Anwar Hossain Manju on June 26. Dhaka metropolitan fourth assistant sessions judge Syed Jahed Mansur Roy heard arguments Wednesday before deciding on the verdict date. Joint forces raided Manju's Dhanmondi house on March 8 and seized 21 bottles of alcoholic beverages. Assistant sub-inspector of Dhanmondi Police Station filed a case against Manju the same day under the Narcotics Control Act, 1990. The investigating officer of the case, sub-inspector of the same police station, Amirul Islam submitted the charge-sheet in the case on May 13. An arrest warrant was issued against Manju showing him as absconding. Manju's lawyers said that they were going to appeal for the dismissal of the case and that was why they had pleaded that the verdict date not be fixed. The court however did not accept the petition. On Manju's whereabouts, his lawyers told bdnews24.com: "He is under medical treatment abroad." Manju's wife Tasmima Hossain, a former lawmaker, was sued Tuesday for allegedly grabbing government land in Savar in 1995. bdnews24
