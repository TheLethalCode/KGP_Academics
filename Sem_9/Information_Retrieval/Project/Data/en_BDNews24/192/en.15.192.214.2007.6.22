 ANKARA, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A majority of Turks believe their country is heading in the wrong direction but they remain cautiously optimistic about the booming economy, according to a survey obtained by Reuters on Friday. Turks rate unemployment as the dominant issue for July 22 national elections, followed by the economy and terrorism, said the poll, organised by the International Republican Institute (IRI), a US-based group promoting global democracy.

The survey found the army -- ultimate guarantor of secularism -- remains Turkey's most trusted institution, well ahead of the government, a result echoing earlier polls. A large majority of Turks believe religion belongs to the private sphere and only a tiny handful back Islamic Sharia law, the poll showed. But most also say women wearing Muslim headscarves at work do not bother them. The headscarf is a touchstone of tension between the AK Party, which wants to relax the ban in public offices and universities, and the secular elite, which sees the garment as a symbolic threat to the separation of religion and state. The IRI is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation running democracy projects in many countries including Turkey. Its survey was based on face-to-face interviews conducted in respondents' hom
