<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  The police recovered the body of a woman from a deserted medical clinic at Komitigonj Lane of Babubazar at 12.30am Friday. They dismantled a door leading to the first floor of the clinic to recover the body after locals complained of a foul smell coming from the clinic. The badly decomposed corpse was sent to Mitford Hospital morgue. All the clinic's staff including physicians from the 'Labcom Diagnostic and Nursing Point' had presumably fled following the death of the patient, said Kotwali police. "We believe the staff of the clinic ran away scared after the woman died under abnormal circumstances," Sub-inspector Fakhrul Alam said. Police could not say how or when the woman died. The unidentified woman was wearing red trousers, a black top and metal bangles. An unnatural death case has been registered with the police. "We are looking for the owner of the clinic and its staff," Alam added. bdnews24.c
