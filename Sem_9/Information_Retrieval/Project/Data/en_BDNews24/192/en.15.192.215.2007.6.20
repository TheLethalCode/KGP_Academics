 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) -- India has offered Bangladesh $10 million in relief assistance for mudslide victims in Chittagong, the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement Wednesday. It said foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in a briefing told reporters that the offer had come from Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh. In a letter to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, Singh expressed deep sadness at the loss of scores of lives in the brutal assault of the nature in the port city, the statement quoted Chowdhury as saying. But it was not clear from the statement when and how the assistance from the next-door neighbour would reach Bangladesh. Torrents of rain recently triggered a massive mudslide in the country's second largest city, burying more than 100 people at scores of homes at the slope and bottom of hills. Chowdhury said the chief adviser expressed his gratitude to the Indian prime minister for expressing sympathy to the victims. bdn
