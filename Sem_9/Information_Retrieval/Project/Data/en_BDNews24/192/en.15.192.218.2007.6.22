 COLOMBO, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka called up opener Michael Vandort on Friday as a replacement for the injured Upul Tharanga for upcoming tests against Bangladesh. Tharanga, 22, is set to miss at least the first test later this month after suffering a hairline fracture in his left foot. The left-hander suffered the injury during net practice and is expected to be out of the side for around two weeks. "We are hoping there is a chance that he can play in the second test," captain Mahela Jayawardene told reporters. Senior openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu are both unavailable for the three-match series. The first test begins in Colombo on June 25
