 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim was sent to jail Thursday after making a confessional statement in a Tk 3 crore extortion case. Investigating officer in the case Obaidul Haque presented Selim to court after two days' remand. Selim was taken to Dhaka metropolitan magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah to record his statement. As Selim was entering the judge's chamber to make his statement, his wife Fatema Selim hugged him and said: "Don't worry, think carefully what you say." The recording began at 3.38pm and ended at 6.30pm, before Sheikh was sent to jail. Selim's lawyers sought bail from the same court and appealed for cancellation of the statement saying that the correct legal procedure was not followed in recording the statement under section 164. The lawyers also urged medical treatment for Selim at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. The court however ordered jail authorities to treat Selim. Investigating officer Obaidul Haque of Gulshan Police Station said: "Sheikh Selim confessed before the magistrate under section 164 that he extorted about Tk 3 crore from Azam J Chowdhury, owner of East Coast Trading Group." Azam J Chowdhury filed a case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and Selim, her cousin, accusing them of extortion. Joint forces arrested Selim on May 29. bdnews24.com/
