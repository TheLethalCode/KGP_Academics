<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The interim cabinet Wednesday decided to give monthly honorarium to the ward commissioners of six city corporations, an official statement said. The meeting, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, took the decision since the ward commissioners of the city corporations were deprived of the monthly financial benefita privilege their colleagues at union parishads and pourasavas have long been enjoying. The emergency cabinet also approved a proposal on the amendment to related laws and ordinance to execute the new payroll plan for the commissioners. The cabinet also approved provisions that envisaged who would take over the role of a city mayor in his absence. The provisions would be applicable when a mayor would not assign anybody from the commissioners to carry out his responsibilities in his absence. Joint forces arrested four mayors and dozens of commissioners during the anti-graft crackdown after the new government took over in mid-January. The cabinet also gave a green light to the draft of the Pourasava (amended) Ordinance 2007 that would allow temporary suspension of ward commissioners of municipalities. The highest decision making body also discussed the activities and future work plan of a project, dubbed 'Local Governance Special Project'. The project has been designed to strengthen, empower and decentralise the local government organs, the statement said. bd
