<TITLE> Real in good health at end of Galactico era - Calderon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid remain in good financial health despite the end of the Galactico era according to club president Ramon Calderon. "Unlike many other clubs Real Madrid have managed to establish a sustainable model that brings us substantial profits," Calderon told reporters at a media briefing on Friday. "We are amongst the 20 most important brands in the world today and we have consolidated our position because of careful management of our resources." Calderon said that Real's financial security was assured and that the club would remain the property of its members. "We don't have a separate economic interest controlling us like a big multinational or a rich businessman like Chelsea's (Roman) Abramovich or Inter's (Massimo) Moratti controlling us, but while I'm in charge this club will never be sold up." "Our income from marketing increased by 16 percent last season and we estimate that we will make some 40 million euros pre-tax profit this season which compares very favourably to clubs like Chelsea who are losing huge amounts of money." PERFECT POSITION The Real supremo said the club's strength lay in the fact that it was not dependent on any one particular source of income. "We are in a perfect position because one third of our income comes from marketing, one third from television and one third from ticket sales and the stadium," he said. "The other advantage we have is that player salaries do not exceed 48 percent of income which is well below the recommended limit of 62 percent set by the G14 group of major clubs." Calderon admitted that the club were owed money by former shirt sponsors BenQ Mobile, who filed for bankruptcy last season, but said a new deal with Austrian online betting form Bwin had minimised the effects of the loss. "We haven't been paid all we should have been and we hope to get around 30 percent despite the backruptcy," he said. "We've probably lost out on 10 million euros." He added that the club's buoyant financial position meant they were able to implement ambitious plans for the future which include the construction of a performance-monitoring centre, a new basketball pavilion and a players' residence
