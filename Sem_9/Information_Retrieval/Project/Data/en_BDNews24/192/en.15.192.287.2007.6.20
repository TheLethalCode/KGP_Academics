 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League leader Amir Hossain Amu Wednesday went hard against his party chief Sheikh Hasina for speeches, which he said, had harmed herself and the party, and angered the interim government. The AL presidium member stressed reforms to political parties to keep politics in the domain of politicians. Amu's remarks came when reporters gathered at his Eskaton home following his return from Singapore. Amu had been abroad for treatment for long. The AL leader said the reforms of political parties were now the demand of the time and claimed that the Awami League had first come up with the reform proposal. Amu said that he knew nothing about a 21-point reform proposal for the Awami League. Awami League joint general secretary Mukul Bose Monday said that a 21-point AL reform proposal promoting accountability, joint leadership and democratic practices would be handed over to party president Sheikh Hasina in three days. "The reform outline has been finalised keeping the AL chief in the loop," Mukul had told reporters. Amu Wednesday stressed freeing political parties of black money and muscle. Democracy and accountability must be ensured within the parties, he added. The AL leader opposed the proposal of setting an age limit for leadership in politics. No leaders over the age of 60 would be allowed to remain a member of the Awami League presidium or central working committee, Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud had quoted her as saying Tuesday. Hasan Mahmud told reporters: "All leaders over 60 will be accommodated in the advisory council." Amu said that there should not be an age limit in politics. "The leader (Hasina) is also 60. She too will have to go to the advisory council if the proposal is implemented. She can put forward such proposal only when she decides to quit politics," Amu said. He, however, endorsed Hasina's proposal that one person would not be allowed to hold two important government and party posts at the same time. "The matter was in the constitution of the Awami League until 1972, but was abolished following Sheikh Hasina's taking over as party chief," Amu said. The AL presidium member said that reform proposals, if Hasina had any, would have to be discussed at the meeting of the central working committee. A final decision will be taken at the party convention. Amu said that the BNP would have to make a fresh constitution, but the Awami League constitution was well accepted. On the much-talked- about 'minus two theory' that meant reforms excluding Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, Amu said that nothing depended on the will of anybody. The parties would decide their own fate, he added. "The Awami League isn't a failed party. But there must be some reforms," Amu said. The AL leader rejected suggestions that the Awami League had undertaken the reform initiative under government pressure. "Not the government, the Awami League first wanted reforms." Amu said the party forum would decide on the arrested AL leaders if corruption charges against them were proved. Amu emphasised accountability about party funds. bdnews
