<TITLE> Niger rebels kill 15 soldiers in desert raid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NIAMEY, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nomadic Tuareg rebels in northern Niger killed 15 government soldiers in an attack on an army outpost in the Sahara desert on Friday, a military officer in the West African country said. "During the battle there were 15 government soldiers killed," the officer told Reuters, asking not to be named. He said the government was holding an emergency meeting to discuss its reponse. The rebel group Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) claimed responsibility for the raid at Tazerzait, a remote settlement around a well near the Algerian and Malian borders. The group said on its Website (http://m-n-j.blogspot.com/) it had attacked two companies of government soldiers, taking 72 prisoners and injuring 43 on top of the 15 killed. It was not immediately possible to verify the claims. The MNJ has stepped up attacks in northern Niger, among the world's top five uranium producers, in recent weeks. President Mamadou Tandja's government denies there is a rebellion and dismisses the raids as acts of comon banditry. The group carried out a hit-and-run attack on Sunday on the airport of Agadez, the region's main town popular with tourists and the gateway to a region where foreign firms are exploring for uranium and oil. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 1-Credit Suisse buys stake in carbon firm (Adds analyst comment, detail, background) By Chris Wills LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has taken a 10 percent stake in carbon project developer EcoSecurities Group for 44 million euros ($59 million), EcoSecurities said on Friday. EcoSecurities acts as a go-between in a growing carbon trade under the Kyoto Protocol, whereby rich countries meet greenhouse gas emissions targets by funding cuts in developing countries. Credit Suisse is following similar moves by Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, betting on a big expansion in carbon trading if, as expected, the United States launches a national carbon trading scheme after President George W. Bush leaves office. In addition, many companies want to exploit a booming, unregulated trade outside Kyoto, for companies and individuals who want to offset their emissions, for example from flights. "(Our goals) include rapid developments in the U.S. and voluntary markets," said Bruce Usher, CEO of EcoSecurities. "The carbon markets are growing rapidly." Credit Suisse is paying 44 million euros for its stake, and EcoSecurities President Pedro Costa and Director Marc Stuart are likely to be major beneficiaries, holding up to now a 28 percent stake in the company. As with all carbon project developers, EcoSecurities is helping generate emissions reductions in developing countries, called carbon credits, the vast majority of which haven't happened yet. As such the firm has very little revenue but high cash requirements to pay its 246 employees. It also needs money to expand in the U.S. A cross-party climate change bill that aims to establish a national carbon trading scheme, supported by all the main presidential candidates, is before a US Senate committee. By investing, Credit Suisse is betting that the Kyoto Protocol gets a new lease of life after 2012, when the present rich country commitments that drive the carbon market expire. "Credit Suisse will not be investing if it thinks Kyoto will drop dead after 2012," said one analyst. Other banks taking staking in carbon project developers so far this year include Merrill Lynch, in the Russian Carbon Fund, Citigroup, in UK-based Sindicatum Carbon Capital, and Morgan Stanley in Miami-based MGM International. Credit Suisse will buy 9.2 million shares at 320p per share, a discount to EcoSecurities' Friday share price of 366-1/2p. EcoSecurities also said it would seek third-party financing for projects through Credit Suisse's clients. EcoSecurities said it also intended to raise 56 million euros by issuing more shares, which would bring the total capital raised to 100 million euros. The firm, or its partners, will also be able to borrow up to 1 billion euros from the bank for new large projects to reduce emissio
