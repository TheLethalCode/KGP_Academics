 LAGOS, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A general strike over a rise in fuel prices brought much of Nigeria to a standstill on Wednesday but oil exports from Africa's top producer were initially unaffected. Unions pressed on with the strike despite a series of concessions offered by President Umaru Yar'Adua, who faces the first major test of his government three weeks after taking office. The offices of Western oil companies in Nigeria were closed along with most other businesses and government offices, but oil production and shipments from the world's eighth largest exporter of crude were uninterrupted, company officials said. "All our offices are locked up, but there has been no interference in our operations yet," said a senior executive at a Western multinational. Unions ordered workers to go on "total strike", but leaders of the oil unions said it would take time to shut down the country's economic lifeline. "Essential operations are continuing this morning. If we affect production that will bring maximum pressure on the government," said Peter Esele, head of the PENGASSAN oil union. Oil companies use non-unionised staff to maintain essential operations, but some union members are required to sign off on exports and this is the most vulnerable link in the chain. Shipping agents said work was continuing normally at the export terminals. London oil futures, which have been supported by fears of a disruption from Nigeria, fell by 50 cents to $71.34 a barrel. Yar'Adua inherited the crisis from his predecessor, ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, who unexpectedly lifted fuel prices, doubled value-added tax and privatised two oil refineries days before leaving office on May 29. NO FUEL Streets in the main cities were deserted, but this was partly due to a five-day-old strike by road tanker drivers which has left most of the country without fuel. Very few buses were operating. Banks, schools and most government offices were closed. Some international and domestic flights were cancelled because of a shortage of jet fuel. Unionists barricaded streets in the southern oil capital of Port Harcourt and ejected workers who turned up for work at government offices in the capital Abuja. Yar'Adua agreed to reverse the tax increase and to implement a public sector pay rise as demanded by the unions, but talks broke down over the fuel price. Unions rejected the government's offer to reduce pump prices by 5 naira (4 cents) a litre, saying only a full reversal of its 10-naira increase would avert the action. Previous strikes in Nigeria have had a limited impact on oil operations, because they tend to build strength slowly and are normally resolved within a few days. Many Nigerians support the strike because the majority lives below the poverty line. Fuel subsidies are seen as one of the few benefits they receive from a government that has failed to deliver power, water, healthcare or schools. Nigeria's four oil refineries have been shut for months because of sabotage and mismanagement, and Africa's largest producer of crude oil is entirely dependent on imports to meet its fuel nee
