<TITLE> EC to fix qualification of its commissioners </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is making a new law that will describe what qualification a person will require to be an election commissioner, an official said Thursday. Election commissioner Sahul Hossain said the move was necessary since currently there was no specific yardstick for the appointment of a commissioner to the top polls office. Hossain said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda was supervising the work on the draft of the new law. "We think it's important. There should be something in place to keep a certain standard so that competent people can play the role of election commissioners," Hossain told reporters in his office. "Even there's no guideline in the constitution," he said. The task of enacting such a guideline is easier for a non-political government, Hossain said, adding that this is the best time to make the law. bdnew
