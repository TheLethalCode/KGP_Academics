<TITLE> Philippines' Arroyo seen stung by senate setback </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's government appears to be in a state of confusion after suffering a humiliating defeat in senatorial elections last month, political analysts said on Wednesday. Arroyo is not personally threatened by the results -- her tenure lasts for another three years and a convincing win for the administration in elections to the lower house, the House of Representatives, ensures there is no threat of impeachment. But Manila is buzzing with talk of a wholesale revamp of the cabinet and other presidential allies because of the setback in the Senate elections in May, in which the opposition won seven of 11 seats declared and anti-Arroyo independents won two more. According to reports, Arroyo has already asked the heads of government institutions and corporations to submit resignations. "The government is in a state of flux after the political debacle on May 14," said Pastor Saycon, a former Arroyo ally turned critic, adding Arroyo's officials have started finger-pointing and looking for scapegoats. Saycon said he had expected changes in Arroyo's political team after the elections, but was surprised she was asking the heads of state corporations and financial institutions to submit courtesy resignations. "I really can't understand why the president is punishing her economic team when it was not responsible for the defeat of her candidates in the senate elections. If the economy is doing well, then why would she make changes in her economic team?" On Wednesday, Mario Bunag, the head of the government's main tax agency, was replaced by one of his deputies for his failure to meet revenue collection targets this year. In a meeting with journalists at the presidential palace on Wednesday, Arroyo said she would remain focused on the economy for her last three years in office, which she described as the "legacy phase". "I will try my best not to be distracted by politics and so we're continuing this kind of work and mindset," she said. But the demand for the resignations of heads of government corporations is creating confusion. Business executives "are wondering what the situation is and who their counterparts would be dealing with, negotiating with and transacting with", said Mar Roxas, a senator formerly allied with the president but is now considered independent. "I think the announcements show the administration is in disarray, worse, it is self-inflicted," Roxas told a news conference on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the government backtracked on its choice for chief negotiator in talks with Muslim rebels. Father Eliseo Mercado, whose appointment was announced on Saturday, declined the job after reports his nomination was opposed by senior government and military officials. A replacement is yet to be announced. Analysts say Arroyo faces a rough time until the end of her term in 2010. "Between now and the end of 2007, the president would be safe from any impeachment motion," Earl Parreno of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms told Reuters. "But, this does not mean she would be free of political troubles. She would actually face tougher challenges in pushing her legislative agenda and there would still be threats to her leadership." Saycon said Arroyo would be able to finish her term but "it would be a rough and bumpy ride" unless she repairs her relations with the opposition-dominated Senate. "After the elections in May, I believe it would all be a downhill drive for Arroyo," Saycon said. "She has been badly bruised and weakened. She'll probably limp all the way to 201
