 ISLAMABAD, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hardline religious students from a mosque in the Pakistani capital kidnapped nine people including six Chinese women early on Saturday, accusing them of running a brothel, the Islamists said. The abductions were the most provocative action by the Taliban-supporting students associated with the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, that they have undertaken since January to press for various demands. "The foreign women were involved in prostitution in a massage centre," the students said in a statement. Chinese embassy officials were not immediately available for comment. China is Pakistan's most steadfast ally and the abductions are bound to embarrass President Pervez Musharraf. Lal Masjid cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi told Reuters seven of the nine, who are being held at a religious school next to the Lal Masjid, were Chinese and two Pakistanis. Six of the Chinese were women, he said. "We greatly respect Pakistan-China friendship but it doesn't mean that foreign women can come here and indulge in such vulgar activities," Ghazi said. "We had complaints that that these women did massage for men but it was more than that." China's Xinhua news agency said Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao had telephoned China's ambassador, Luo Zhaohui, to apologise and to ensure him of the quick, safe release of the hostages. Minister of State for Interior Zafar Iqbal Warraich told parliament mosque authorities had been ordered to release them. Authorities have been confronting the clerics and students at the mosque for months. The radicals have threatened suicide bombings if force was used against them. Trouble began in January when female students attached to the mosque occupied a library next to their school to protest against a campaign to remove mosques built illegally on state land. In March, the students abducted three Pakistani women they accused of running a brothel and held them for several days before forcing them to confess and releasing them. They have also abducted and briefly held policemen and have warned video shops to stop selling Western films deemed obscene. The behaviour of the students, reminiscent of the Taliban in Afghanistan, coupled with the authorities' failure to rein them in, has dismayed many residents of the country's relatively cosmopolitan capital. "NATURAL REACTION" Followers of the Lal Mosque have become increasingly bold in their self-styled anti-vice campaign. Warraich said the students had gone to what he described as a Chinese health centre, in a residential neighbourhood, in three vehicles in the middle of the night to grab the nine. The China Daily newspaper said in an online report the Chinese were running an acupuncture centre. The students denied kidnapping anyone and said they wanted to persuade the nine to give up their vulgar ways. The nine were being treated well and were being given Chinese food, one woman student said. Musharraf has said he felt humiliated by his inability to oust the radical clerics from their city-centre mosque. They have close to 5,000 followers drawn from associated madrasas. Fears of a backlash if any of the female students were hurt in an assault has stayed the government's hand, he said. Instead, the government, which is struggling with a judicial crisis sapping its popularity, has tried to mollify the Islamists. Some government critics have accused authorities of putting the students up to their stunts to divert attention from the government's woes.
