 RIYADH, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Interior Minister has warned the conservative Islamic state's clergy that they should discourage Saudis, including their own children, from going to fight in Iraq. In a speech before hundreds of clerics, Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz appeared to suggest that some members of Saudi Arabia's powerful religious establishment had not doing enough in the fight against militants who are warring against Western influence in the region.

The minister, who maintains close links with the religious establishment, reminded the preachers of the historic alliance between the royal family and Saudi Arabia's austere Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam. Saudi Arabia imposes strict Islamic law, overseen by clerics with wide influence in society. Clerics back the royal family as absolute rulers. The government allows no political parties and thanks to high oil revenues does not impose taxes. "Preventive measures have foiled over 90 percent of the actions of these errant people," he said. "Let's imagine that they had succeeded with 30 percent of their acts ...
