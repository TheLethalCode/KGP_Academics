 LONDON, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards has been fined 15 percent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council for swearing during the final test against hosts England. "When bowling, and in frustration, Fidel swore loudly enough to be heard by spectators at the ground and television audiences," ICC match referee Alan Hurst said in a statement on Wednesday. "We are not saying that players cannot show frustration or demonstrate passion, but Fidel's means of doing that was totally unacceptable and does not set an appropriate example." "The player regrets his actions and I trust this penalty will serve to ensure it does not occur again." Edwards's frustrations spilled over during the final day at Chester-le-street. England won the match by seven wickets on Tuesday to wrap up the four-test series 3-0. Penalty for level 1 breaches of the code of conduct ranges from an official reprimand to 50 percent fine of the player's match fee. The referee's decision is final and binding
