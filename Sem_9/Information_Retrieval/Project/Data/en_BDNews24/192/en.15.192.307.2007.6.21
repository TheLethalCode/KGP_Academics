 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Thursday that democracy had not worked in the AL and stressed reforms to the party to function democratically. Amu's remarks came when he and some senior members met "informally" and talked about the AL's need to reform to operate properly. After the meeting at his Eskaton home, Amu said democratic means did not work in the AL. He pressed for reform efforts for the AL to function in a democratic way. Senior leaders Abdur Razzak, Suranjit Sengupta and former state minister Abu Sayeed were present. The leaders said they had come to see Amu's ailing wife. "We have talked about the present situation. I was abroad. So party colleagues are coming to see me and to hold talks. We have exchanged views," Amu said after the meeting. They will discuss and finalise reform plans, he added. Following Amu's return, AL leaders have been meeting him on a regular basis. At least 13 central leaders held a meeting with him for over one and a half hours Thursday. bdnew
