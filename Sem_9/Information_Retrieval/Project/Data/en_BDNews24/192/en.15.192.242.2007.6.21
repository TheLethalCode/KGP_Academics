 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Three seaports in the country have been asked to raise local cautionary signal No.3 due to the formation of a depression caused by the monsoon, mid-west of the Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas. According to the meteorological department, the depression was positioned 1,065 kilometres southwest of Chittagong seaport, 1015 kilometres southwest of Cox's Bazar seaport and 915 kilometres southwest of Mongla seaport in midday monitoring. It is expected to gain strength and proceed northwest. Director of the meteorological office Samarendra Karmakar told bdnews24.com: "The depression is in the primary stage. It is stationed near the coast of Bangladesh and India. It might gain strength and cross the Andhra coast of India." A special weather bulletin said the maximum wind speed within 44 kilometres of the centre of the depression is 40 km/h, which will increase to 50 km/h in the form of squalls and stormy winds. The sea may be moderately rough. Under the impact of the monsoon depression, winds are gaining strength in the northern part of the Bay. As a result, stormy winds are expected to blow over the three seaports. Fishing trawlers and boats at sea in the northern Bay have been asked to stay near the coast with caution until further notice. bdnews2
