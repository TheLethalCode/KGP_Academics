<TITLE> No 'golden handshake' for corrupt Biman staff: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Biman employees with corruption ties will be shut out of the golden handshake opportunity, a senior official said Thursday. Responding to a government proposal, as many as 2,162 employees of Biman Bangladesh Airlines have signed up for voluntary retirement. The opportunity will not apply to the applicants who are essential to run Biman and those with corruption links, acting civil aviation and tourism secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali told bdnews24.com. The so-called golden handshake opportunity will cover only 1,593 employees, which is part of a government effort to overhaul the loss-making national flag carrier, now staffed with 4,800. The golden handshake will be effective from July 1. "The committee formed with Biman's managing director MA Momen as its chief will take a final decision after scrutiny," Altaf said. The government took up the voluntary retirement scheme to make Biman profitable and turn it into a public limited company. The government set Biman employees a June 20 deadline to turn in applications for retirement. The finance ministry has agreed to allocate Tk 297 crore for the scheme. bdnews24.c
