<TITLE> Mainul takes flak from lawyers for Bangabandhu murder comment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) - Senior lawyers linked to the Awami League Wednesday took a dig at law adviser Mainul Hosein for his comment that the government has other priorities than handling the Bangabandhu murder case. In a statement, the lawyers led by Barrister Shafiq Ahmed slammed Barrister Mainul Hosein, saying his comment went against humanity. When reporters pressed Mainul Monday for details about what steps the government would take to revive the stalled Bangabandhu murder case, Mainul said the government had other priorities than dealing with the matter. The issue came to a head after Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed was deported by the United Sates Monday after his protracted efforts for asylum in North America fell apart. The adviser had said Mohiuddin could appeal against a High Court order that upheld the trial court's verdict, which sentenced him to death for his role in the killing of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family. "Mohiuddin is a convict. He will stay in jail. If the Appellate Division accepts, he can appeal against his conviction like other accused," Mainul had told reporters. His comment sparked resentment in political arena, especially in the Awami League and its allies. Many of the newspaper editorials and television talk shows also touched on the issue, advocating a fair deal in handling the politically sensitive issue. The lawyers' statement Wednesday said Mainul's comment had gone against the spirit of the rule of law and human rights. "If his statement is the government's stand, it'll damage and dispute the government's image," the statement said. "Mainul Hosein's statement implies that he is defending the killers (of Bangabandhu)," it said. bd
