 PRISTINA, Serbia (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union warned Kosovo on Thursday against an "irresponsible" declaration of independence after Russia again rejected a Western-backed United Nations resolution that would effectively grant the move. EU Kosovo envoy Stefan Lehne said it "would be a huge step backwards" if Kosovo Albanian leaders were to take the issue into their own hands. "Unilateral action or other irresponsible behavior in Kosovo would take away all the goodwill that you have received," he told reporters after meeting the ethnic Albanian president of Serbia's breakaway southern province, Fatmir Sejdiu.

Russia's rejection increased pressure on Kosovo's main supporters, the United States and the EU, to consider backing a unilateral declaration of independence or risk potentially serious unrest among Kosovo's two million Albanians. Security is in the hands of 16,000 NATO soldiers. Washington has indicated it would support such a step, but the 27-member EU fears its fragile unity on the issue would crumble and it would not have a legal basis to take over supervision of Kosovo from the eight-year-old UN missi
