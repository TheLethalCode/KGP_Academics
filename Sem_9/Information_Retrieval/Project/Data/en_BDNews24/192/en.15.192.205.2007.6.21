<TITLE> BB enjoys full autonomy: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said that the central bank was enjoying absolute autonomy in policy- making issues. "The Bangladesh Bank (BB) is independent in all components of monetary policy," Azizul said. "The BB only lacks autonomy in the creation of positions and salary hikes for its employees," the finance adviser told a post-budget discussion organised by the Economic Reporters' Forum at the CIRDAP. Earlier, on June 10, BB governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed at a programme sought full autonomy of the central bank for proper functioning of the banking sector. The governor had said that the BB was more or less guided by a ministry. He said that it was often a lengthy process to get clearance from the government for the bank to take decisions. The finance adviser said that the government did not give directives to the bank regarding policy-making issues. "They (BB) are absolutely free. Recently, the BB has decided to raise the paid-up capital of a bank to Tk 200 crore from Tk 100 crore," Azizul said. For issuing bonds, he said that the BB had to discuss the issue with the government. But a final decision lay with the BB authority, he added. The adviser, however, admitted that the government had macro-power, and that the proper functioning of the bank depended on the understanding between the finance minister and the governor. The governor had said that full autonomy would turn the central bank into a dynamic regulator and supervisor of the country's banks and financial institutions. bd
