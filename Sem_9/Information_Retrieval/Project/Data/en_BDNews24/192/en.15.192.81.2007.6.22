 By Blaise Robinson PARIS, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stock markets were lower at midday on Friday, retreating for a second session in a row as a steeper than expected drop in the German Ifo business sentiment index in June dampened the mood and energy shares fell along with weaker oil prices. Recently-hammered retailers regained some ground as investors decided their losses on the prospects of rising UK rates had gone far enough. Tesco surged 3 percent, while Morrison Supermarkets gained 2 percent. By 1212 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.23 percent at 1,600.55, after retreating 1 percent on Thursday amid renewed interest rate worries that weighed on shares in the banking and real estate sectors. Europe's benchmark index is still up 7.9 percent so far this year, driven higher by a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as well as robust earnings. Oil companies were among the biggest fallers, dropping along with crude oil futures. France's Total was down 1 percent, and Royal Dutch Shell shed 0.6 percent. German business confidence fell across all sector of the country's economy, the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute said. Its closely-watched Ifo Index came in at 107.0 in June, down from 108.6 in the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 108.4. "Despite the dip, the index is still at very high levels. But the drop has an impact on a hesitant market, " said Jean-Francois Virolle, chief strategist at Global Equities, in Paris. "The market is looking for a direction right now in the face of a volatile bond market and investors have a lot to be worried about at the moment -- the prospect of rising rates, rallying commodity prices and the U.S. dollar is weak, all factors that can weigh on companies' profitability," he said. "But I think this is just a phase, and there is no real change to the fundamentals." Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 was down 0.27 percent, France's CAC 40 eased 0.16 percent and Frankfurt's DAX slipped 0.2 percent. Stocks rose in early trade, in the wake of a robust finish in U.S. markets where brokerage upgrades boosted stocks in the semiconductor sector, before slipping into the red. "Equities are very cheap relative to bonds and will remain in an uptrend, albeit with building volatility until the point that either equities become expensive to bonds or alternatively, and this is more likely, that the cost of borrowing just becomes prohibitively expensive in absolute terms," said Peter Lucas, global investment strategist at fund manager Ashburton. The mergers and acquisitions buzz was back on Friday, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that NYSE Euronext had stepped into the bidding for Italy's bourse, the target of an offer from London Stock Exchange. NYSE Euronext's shares dipped 0.3 percent while LSE's shares rose 1.2 percent. In the banking sector Barclays lost 0.7 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 1.3 percent. RBS, Spain's Santander and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis earlier said they expected to issue offer documents in relation to their 71 billion-euro bid for ABN AMRO by mid-July. The three banks are seeking to overturn an agreed all-share bid for the Dutch bank by Barclays. Among big gainers, Pearson rose 2.4 percent after the company said it will not pursue an offer with GE for Dow Jones. Moving into the opposite direction was Julius Baer, down 5.4 percent after Swiss bank UBS said it would sell its controlling stake in the rival to institutional investors and to Baer. UBS dropped 1.4 percent. Markets in Sweden and Finland were closed for a holida
