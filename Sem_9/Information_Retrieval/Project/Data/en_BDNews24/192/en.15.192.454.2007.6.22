 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank Thursday approved a $100 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to support education reforms, according to a WB statement Friday. "Despite impressive progress, Bangladesh needs substantial improvement in providing quality education in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and its Education for All targets," said Xian Zhu, the bank's country director in Bangladesh. The government has already begun implementing substantive reforms as part of an education sector development programme supported by a series of IDA credits. The programme supports reforms to tackle governance problems in secondary education, enhance the quality of secondary school teachers and tie government support to the performance of the institutions. "We hope this will also lead to greater access to secondary education for all children, especially the poor and marginalised who cannot afford the expenses of secondary schooling," Zhu said. bdnews
