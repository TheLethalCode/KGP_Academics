<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Transport experts Friday asked for changes to the Strategic Transport Plan (STP) designed to develop the transportation system in the capital. Dr Mahbubul Bari, senior assistant manager of Transport For London, said at a seminar if the plan is implemented in its current form, it would rather increase time, cost, pollution and accident. Other speakers at the seminar, organised by Paribesh Banchao Andolon (Movement to save the environment) at the Jatiya Press Club, came down hard on proposed project. In the key note paper, Dr Bari, the parent organisation of the London Underground network, pointed out the drawbacks of the STP. "Reducing the number of private cars, a sustainable and environment-friendly public transport system has to be built up," he said. The project called for an increase in the number of transport to ease the transportation problem but, he said, without a control mechanism the problem would remain. He said the plan acknowledged the need for fuel-free vehicle, but it recommended fuel-dependent transport. Dr Roksana Hafiz, chairman of BUET urban planning department, said there was no need to withdraw rickshaws. She said if the condition of the rickshaw-pullers improved or alternative transport was available, rickshaws would automatically go off the roads. Prof AQM Mahbub, chairman of the Department of Geography and Environment at Dhaka University, also opposed the idea of withdrawing rickshaws. He called for making all information about STP public. He said a plan has to be formulated through discussion keeping in mind the greater and poorer communities. Engineer Sheikh Muhammad Shahidullah, convenor of the Committee for Protection of Oil-Gas Resources, Power and Port, said the proposed STP was unrealistic as it ignored majority of the population. Convenor of the Andolon Abu Naser Khan said the implementation of the proposed project would need Tk 35,000 crore and in the end, it would only spoil Dhaka City. bdnews24
