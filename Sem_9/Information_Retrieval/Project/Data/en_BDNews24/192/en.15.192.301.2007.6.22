<TITLE> FIFA altitude ban plays into hands of Evo Morales </TITLE>

 LA PAZ, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A controversial FIFA ban on playing international soccer games at high altitudes has handed Bolivian President Evo Morales a rallying cause that is proving popular in the Andean country. Since world soccer's governing body made the ruling last month, Morales has made getting it scrapped a personal crusade -- donning his soccer gear for mountain-top kickabouts, calling emergency cabinet meetings and sending ministers to doorstep FIFA headquarters in Switzerland. While critics say his approach smacks of populism, it is going down well with many ordinary Bolivians, who acknowledge their country's natural advantage in high-altitude matches with unabashed delight. "His position in defense of altitude is very admirable and it's meant he's won greater acceptance, even among the middle class," said Bolivian military retiree Robin Johns, 55, doing a crossword puzzle outside of La Paz's international soccer stadium, located some 3,600 metres (11,800 feet) above sea level. Leftist Morales, a former coca farmer raised in the Andean highlands, appears keen to keep the issue high on the agenda at a time when his plans for constitutional reform are drawing fierce opposition and sometimes violent protests. Although a constitutional assembly is struggling to find consensus on other issues, it voted unanimously for a resolution condemning the FIFA ruling, which also affects Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. 'PERFECT OPPORTUNITY' In mountainous La Paz, banners have sprung up in parks and plazas, vowing to defend soccer at altitude, and local media have launched a campaign for readers to send a million letters of protest to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Morales plans to meet Blatter in Zurich next week, taking with him mayors from cities affected by the ban on stadiums at more than 2,500 metres (8,200 feet), imposed by FIFA to protect players' health and fair competition. "This isn't a health matter, it's a wholly political matter," Morales said on Thursday after lobbying diplomats from FIFA countries including Switzerland and Japan. Critics say he is trying to deflect attention from the problems in South America's poorest country, and that his time could be better spent on other issues. "(Morales) has some very shrewd people who saw how to use the opportunity presented by this case. Football was a perfect opportunity to distract the country," said Susana Seleme, a newspaper columnist from the opposition stronghold of Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia. Bolivia is marked by deep regional and ethnic divisions, but soccer is one of the few issues that unites, even if its home advantage has rarely led to major international triumphs. "The president's right when he says that in spite of our differences football has always united us, black, white, rich or poor," said Johns at the stadium in La Paz
