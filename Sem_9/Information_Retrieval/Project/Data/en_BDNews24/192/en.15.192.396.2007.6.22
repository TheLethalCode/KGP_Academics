<TITLE> Japan to warn public ahead of earthquakes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan, one of the world's most earthquake-prone areas, will warn the public ahead of tremors from October, giving people up to 20 seconds to take cover under tables, move away from buildings or stop driving. The Meteorological Agency's early warning system would send alerts once it detects primary waves, or the first waves of an earthquake that do not cause major rattling but travel faster than secondary waves that are responsible for shaking. The warnings will be broadcast on television and radio, an agency official said on Friday. New mobile phones equipped to receive the warnings will also go on sale later this year. The alerts could precede the shaking by 10 to 20 seconds, although the grace period would be much shorter and in some cases absent if the tremor's focus is near. Japan started providing the information to emergency personnel, construction sites and train operators last August, but it had put off making the warnings available to the broader public to avoid panic among residents who might not understand the system. "We will be working to make sure the public knows the proper course of action when they hear the warning," the agency official said. "Basically, people need to stay calm and first ensure their own safety," he said. The agency recommends hiding under sturdy tables, steering clear of buildings and getting off elevators. Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 hit central Japan in 1995, killing more than 6,400 people and causing an estimated $100 billion in damage. In 2004, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the northern prefecture of Niigata, killing about 40 and injuring more than 3,000.
