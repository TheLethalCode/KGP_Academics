<TITLE> N Korea to shut reactor in about 3 weeks: Hill </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea will shut down its controversial Yongbyon reactor very soon, probably within three weeks, the top US nuclear envoy said in Tokyo on Saturday. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, who made a brief trip to the isolated East Asian state this week, was speaking to reporters after talks at the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Hill said shutdown of the reactor, source of Pyongyang's weapons-grade plutonium, would take place after North Korea reached agreement with the U.N. nuclear watchdog on monitoring the operation. The next round of 6-way talks on scrapping North Korea's nuclear program would take place after the reactor shutdown began, he said. North Korea committed itself to closing down Yongbyon, the source of its weapons-grade plutonium, in a February 13 six-party deal with top regional powers the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. The move has been delayed in a row over the release of Pyongyang funds long frozen in a Macau bank. Russian reports said on Friday the money would be transferred into a North Korean account in Russia on Monday, potentially resolving the impasse. North Korea said on Saturday it would begin implementing the disarmament deal as soon as it recovered the Macau funds. U.N. nuclear inspectors are to visit North Korea for five days starting on Tuesday to help draw up plans for the reactor shutdown. But Hill cautioned that closing the nuclear facility was just the beginning of the process. "Shutting down the reactor does not solve all our problems," he told reporters in Tokyo.
