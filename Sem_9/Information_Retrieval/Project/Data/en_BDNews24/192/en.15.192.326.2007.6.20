 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  The B. League's fourth treble from Nigerian striker Emeka Christina Wednesday helped title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club top the table with a 7-0 drubbing of their Chittagong namesakes at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Dhaka Mohammedan tasted their first victory in the second leg with the win having drawn three matches in a row against Muktijoddha Sangsad, Sheikh Russel KC and Dhaka Abahani Limited. The seventh win in 14 matches put the Motijheel-based outfit at the top of the table with 26 points, one ahead of Muktijoddha Sangsad who have played one match less. Chittagong Mohammedan, who had tied down their Dhaka namesakes to a goalless draw at home, are on 17 points from 13 matches. On a water-soaked heavy pitch, the Motijheel outfit dominated the visitors right from the word go and led the first half 4-0. Emeka, who missed the previous game against Abahani, struck in the 16th minute after the hosts survived a close call from opposing striker Mohammad Yousuf in the eighth minute. The lanky Nigerian made no mistake in tapping the ball home from a close range after Jumratul Islam Mithu saw his header denied by the woodwork. Four minutes later, Emeka doubled the lead heading a cross by midfielder Mohammad Sharif past the goalkeeper. Mohammedan captain and league's top scorer Mwach Ukwu Paul made it 3-0 without facing any challenge from the opponents in the 22nd minute. Emeka completed his hat-trick in the 35th minute with a low grounder from the left. His teammate Paul, Muktijoddha's Alfaz Ahmed and Brothers' Elijah Obagbemiro Junior have struck treble before him. Midfielder Mithu headed home 16 minutes into the second half from a corner to make it 5-0. He widened the margin dodging past two defenders to fire home in the 71st minute after his angled shot rattled the Chittagong Mohammedan woodwork six minutes earlier. Nigerian central defender Peter Odaf completed the plight of the visitors after being set up nicely by substitute midfielder Asadur Rahman Asad one minute from time.
