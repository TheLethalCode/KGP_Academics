<TITLE> Peru's Fujimori considers Japanese politics </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is under house arrest in Chile, will decide before the end of the month whether to run for a seat in Japan's July upper house elections, Kyodo news agency said on Saturday. Peru is seeking to extradite Fujimori, who has Japanese citizenship, to face corruption and human rights charges dating back to his 1990-2000 rule. But he has also been approached by the tiny Japanese opposition People's New Party to stand in the July 29 poll. "I want to spend some time thinking about whether to stand or not," Fujimori told Kyodo in an interview in the suburbs of Santiago, where he is being held. "It is an honour to be asked, but I have never thought about becoming a lawmaker in Japan. It is a difficult decision," he told Kyodo, adding he would decide by the end of June. He denied he would try to become a Japanese lawmaker to avoid the extradition process, Kyodo said. Although tiny, the People's New Party could be a key force in Japan's upper house election, because it could be tapped as an ally by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party if the LDP coalition fails to rack up enough seats for a majority. "I think I could use my experience as president," Fujimori told Kyodo of what he could offer the Japanese electorate. Kyodo said it was legally possible to stand as a candidate while in detention abroad.
