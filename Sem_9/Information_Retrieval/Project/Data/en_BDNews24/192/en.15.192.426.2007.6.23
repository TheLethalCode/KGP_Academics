 CHICAGO, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pregnant women with high blood sugar levels may be at risk for some of the same problems faced by women with gestational diabetes -- the risk of a Caesarean delivery and a big baby who might have health problems down the road, researchers said on Friday. They said the seven-year international study, presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Chicago, may spark a new look at where to draw the line for diagnosing a woman with gestational diabetes. The condition -- in which a woman who has never had diabetes loses her ability to use insulin properly during pregnancy -- affects about 4 percent of all pregnant women. In the United States, there are about 135,000 cases of gestational diabetes each year. Treatment usually consists of diet and exercise. If left untreated, the mother can transfer extra blood sugar to the fetus, causing the fetus' pancreas to make extra insulin to handle the overload of sugar. This extra energy can produce large babies that may have trouble breathing at birth and could become obese as a child and develop diabetes in adulthood. "From the pediatric standpoint, that child is forever at high risk for diabetes him or herself," Dr Francine Kaufman of the University of Southern California and past president of the American Diabetes Association, said in a telephone interview. The study, led by Dr Boyd Metzger of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, involved 23,325 women at 15 centers in nine countries who were tracked during pregnancy. At about 28 weeks of gestation, the mothers were given a series of tests for blood glucose. Except in the cases of women who clearly needed treatment for gestational diabetes, the pregnancies were allowed to proceed. What Metzger and colleagues found is that the higher a woman's blood glucose got, the more likely the child was to be large, to be delivered by Caesarean section, to have low blood glucose needing treatment and to have high levels of insulin. The definition of what constitutes a large baby was left up to the centers, based on local population norms. The researchers were not able to arrive at the exact point where high blood sugar becomes a problem, something that will require further analysis. But the findings were compelling. "We found that some problems occurred even in ranges previously considered within the normal range for pregnant women," Metzger said in a statement. He said it is likely that the level of a mother's blood glucose used to diagnose gestational diabetes will be lowered based on the study's findings. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the American Diabetes Associati
