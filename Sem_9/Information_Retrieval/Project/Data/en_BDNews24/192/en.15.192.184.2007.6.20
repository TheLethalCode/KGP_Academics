 JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's government gave unions an ultimatum to accept a revised pay offer on Wednesday or make do with a previous lower offer in its final push to end a costly three-week civil service strike. The government's settlement salary package includes a 7.5 percent wage increase and an increased housing allowance of 500 rand ($70.57) from 456 rand, union officials said. But that was still below the unions' revised demand of a 9 percent pay raise. There were no signs of a breakthrough as the powerful COSATU labour federation prepared to hold a meeting at 1400 GMT to decide on a response to the government's deadline for an agreement by 1600 GMT. The stalemate has highlighted the divide between the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and its trade union allies, which accuse President Thabo Mbeki of promoting big business and leaving behind millions of poor South Africans. The civil servants strike, which began on June 1, has crippled some state institutions and may cost the economy billions of rand, while the impact of higher wages could push up inflation and interest rates. Union officials accused the government of using strong-arm tactics in its latest offer. "We are not sure whether it is talks that we are going for anymore because this is now just (the government's) take it or leave it situation," Mannie de Clercq, general secretary of the Public Servants Association of South Africa, told Reuters. Analysts say the strike has become a demonstration of workers' power ahead of a leadership congress this year that may see the ANC name a successor to Mbeki. Mbeki is due to step down as president in 2009, and there is speculation the ANC may steer away from his market-friendly policies, which COSATU and other critics say have failed to dent economic disparities that linger from the apartheid era. The strike has caused chaos in hospitals, schools and public offices and some South Africans say loved ones have died as a result of problems in hospitals and other key facilities. The government initially proposed a 6 percent rise which it later upped to 7.5 percent, while the unions' opening demand was for a 12 percent rise. They later lowered the figure to 9 percent. Some unions seemed flexible. Mthimkhulu Mashiya, general secretary of the small South African State and Allied Workers Union, reiterated it would accept a pay rise offer of 8 percent to 10 percent. "The government's current offer is slightly below that range but on the other hand we now have an improvement in benefits," he told Reute
