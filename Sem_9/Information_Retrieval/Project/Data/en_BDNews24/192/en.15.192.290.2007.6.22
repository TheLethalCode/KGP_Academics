 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of hawkers in Gulistan exploded into demonstrations for hours on end after a speeding pick-up van crushed to death two of their colleagues early Friday, spelling traffic trouble. Sub-inspector Noor Jahan Begum, duty officer at Paltan Police Station, said a speeding poultry-loaded van lost control and ran over the three hawkers squatting at the roadside at around 2:30am. They skipped trading in the Friday holiday market in the area and wore black badges to mourn the deaths. Some 1,500 hawkers attended a funeral prayer for the dead. The police sealed off Paltan, Bangladesh Secretariat and Gulistan areas, diverting traffic to other roads as hundreds of hawkers from other city areas streamed to Gulistan to join in the demonstrations. The sub-inspector said the hawkers were among those who gathered there in a desperate attempt to occupy the prized spots at the Friday holiday market. Mohammed Shujan, 18, son of Fazal Miah from Chandina, Comilla, died on the spot. Mohammed Riazuddin, 38, from Laksam Purbopara died on way to hospital. Shujan returned to Dhaka only three days ago after his marriage, a hawkers' leader said. Mohammed Jahangir was admitted to Dhaka Orthopaedic Hospital and his condition was said to be critical. The hawkers wore black badges to mourn the deaths and protest the incident. They continued staging demonstrations since early morning at Gulistan. Braving heavy rains, hundreds of hawkers joined the protests, witnesses said. bdnews24.com Correspondent Abu Noman Sajib saw several hundred policemen at Bangabandhu Avenue. "We will not go home until the government pays compensation to the victims' families," Anwar Hossain, a hawker at Gulistan said. Md Azahar Sheikh, general secretary of a grassroots small businessmen association (Trinamul Khudra Byabshaee Samity), said some of them could not hold themselves at the sight of spilled blood of their fellow businessmen. "I heard that some chanted slogans. But there was no procession under the banner of the association. Hawkers planned a funeral prayer at Gulistan but the bodies were sent home under police guard," Azahar said. He said there are 16,000 hawkers doing business at Gulistan. But the holiday market can accommodate only 3,000 and the hawkers had to fight to secure a place. He asked the government to allow them to sit on sidewalks after 3pm. bdnews24.com/
