 JERUSALEM Fri Jun 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Envoys from the Quartet of international powers trying to mediate peace in the Middle East will meet in Jerusalem next week for the first time since Palestinian Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government and diplomats in the city said on Friday that the envoys from the United States, European Union, United Nations and Russia would meet on Tuesday -- a day after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas holds his first talks in two months with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Olmert and aides to Abbas have spoken of a "new beginning" at Monday's summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, now that the exclusion of Hamas from a new government based in Abbas's West Bank stronghold has prompted the lifting of Israeli and Western sanctions on the Palestinian Authority. But Israeli and Palestinian officials are deeply skeptical that two weak and hardly popular leaders can deliver concessions to the other that could bring progress toward reopening full negotiations on the establishment of a Palestinian state. Given that for the past week one of the two territories earmarked for that state, Gaza, is under the control of an administration which neither Abbas nor Olmert will talk to, the prospects for substantive change seem remote, many s
