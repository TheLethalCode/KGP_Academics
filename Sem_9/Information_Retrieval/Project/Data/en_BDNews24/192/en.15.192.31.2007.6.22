 LONDON, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Durham batsman Paul Collingwood was named on Friday as England's new one-day captain, taking over the reins from his friend and test captain Michael Vaughan. Collingwood, 31 takes up the captaincy after Vaughan relinquished it after four years on Monday. England's chairman of selectors David Graveney told their Web site (www.ecb.co.uk): "The selectors believe that Paul Collingwood's experience and performances in the one-day game make him the ideal candidate to lead the side. "He has been a key member of the one-day team for a while and we believe he is ready to take on the additional responsibility of captaincy. "Overall, we were keen to identify the best way for the team to play in the one day game, pick players who can perform certain roles and keep one eye on the need to build towards the World Cup in 2011." Vaughan said on Monday he would continue to play one-day cricket for Yorkshire, but would only look at returning to international one-dayers after giving the new skipper time to establish his authority. He was not named in a re-shuffled squad to face West Indies in the one-day series. NEVER SPARKLED Vaughan has never really sparkled in the one-day game -- averaging 27.15 in 86 matches, compared to a test average of 43.65. Collingwood, with a better one-day average of 34.89, showed his batting talents by smashing 128 against West Indies on his home ground in Durham on Monday, setting England on their way to victory the next day in the fourth test and a 3-0 series win. Collingwood made his one-day debut in 2001 and is an excellent fielder and a useful bowler. He will be expected to add fresh bite to a side who are only ranked seventh in the one-day world, compared to second in tests. England flopped at the World Cup, failing to reach the semi-finals and or to beat any of the top sides. The disappointment was all the sharper after a promising tri-series win over Australia and New Zealand in February. England face West Indies in two Twenty20 games this month and three one-day internationals in July, before going on to play seven one-dayers against India in August and September. England team : Paul Collingwood (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Liam Plunkett, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Ryan Sidebottom, Jonathan Trott, Michael Yardy
