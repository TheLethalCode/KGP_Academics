<TITLE> Reform depends on dialogue: Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina said Saturday that they would bring changes to the party through discussion, and all reform proposals would be placed before the working committee. The former prime minister said a quarter was trying to plot against the party but they were ready to face any hurdle. "The Awami League is a democratic party. Every contentious issue will come to the party forum. Everybody (inside the party) will take the outcome of the discussion into account," Hasina told reporters, as she along with senior party colleagues visited Bangabandhu Memorial Museum to commemorate the party's 58th founding anniversary. "I wanted elections in June. We had failed to reach a concensus. So it didn't proceed further," she said, adding that all issues will be settled in the party's working committee meeting. Hasina along with Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Mukul Bose went to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the city's Dhanmondi area at 8:25am. Later, she held a meeting with the party colleagues for one and a half hours. Amu recently led some of the influential presidium members of the party to take a dig at the party chief for what they said had brought misfortune to the party. They accused Hasina of ignoring the highest decision making body to take some vital party decisions in the past, saying they want an end to such practice to "re-establish democracy" in the party. The stand triggered confusion among the activists, but Saturday's meeting with the so-called party renegades apparently has watered the boiling confrontation. Hasina explained her position about her party's election alliance with the communal Khilafat-e-Majlish party before the four-party coalition government expired in October. "They came to us promising a secular policy. But now that deal is not existent." About the party's source of money, she said: "The Awami League does not need to demand money from anybody. The well-wisher give fund willingly, and that's the strength of the party." Meanwhile, Amu separately told reporters that they would make changes to bring only good to the party. He repeated the statement of the party chief, saying the party forum would decide everything. bdnews24.
