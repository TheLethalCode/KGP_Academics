 ROME, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus have signed Portuguese international Tiago and Argentine midfielder Sergio Almiron, the Serie A club said on Friday. Both men signed five-year deals. Tiago, 26, joined from French champions Olympique Lyon for 13 million euros while Almiron, also 26, has moved from Empoli in a 9.0 million euro deal with the rejuvenated club, back in Serie A after being demoted to Serie B for match-fixing last year. The midfielder was a key factor in Empoli qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time last season as Serie A's surprise package. Tiago, a defensive midfielder, has joined after two seasons in France following one season in London with Chelsea. Juventus are busy rebuilding their squad for the top flight under new manager Claudio Ranieri. Italy striker Vincenzo Iaquinta arrived from Udinese earlier this week before Cristian Molinaro and Antonio Nocerino both joined Juventus permanently after their co-ownership deals with Siena and Piacenza respectively were resolved. Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has extended his contract with the Turin club while Juve hope to persuade David Trezeguet, Mauro Camoranesi and Pavel Nedved to stay. Ranieri has been linked in the media with a number of other players including Olympique Lyon midfielder Tiago, Real Zaragoza defender Gabriel Milito, former Juve centre back Fabio Cannavaro, Chelsea's Frank Lampard, Liverpool's Momo Sissoko and Ajax striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar. In notable departures, promising defender Federico Balzaretti was surprisingly sold to Fiorentina and Croatia centre back Robert Kovac has left for Borussia Dortmund
