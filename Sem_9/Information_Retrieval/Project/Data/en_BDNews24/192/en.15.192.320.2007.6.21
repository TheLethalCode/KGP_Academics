 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Thursday signed two separate agreements worth $23 million with the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary arm. The money will target village communities and the deprived segment of the urban poor in Dhaka. Economic Relations Division secretary M Aminul Islam Bhuiyan and World Bank country director Xian Zhu signed the deal, the WB said in a statement. Additional financing of $8 million to the Social Investment Programme Project (SIPP) will support the development of sustainable and effective institutional arrangements at the village level. Further funding of $15 million will go to the Second Poverty Alleviation Micro-finance Project. This initiative provides micro-finance services to rickshaw pullers and other non-motorised transport workers. Rickshaw workers were among the worst affected by the non-motorised transport ban implemented in Dhaka. The new funding aims to restore their livelihoods. The World Bank statement added that the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation would also administer the additional financing which is treated as a separate loan by the World Bank and constitutes a new commitment. bd
