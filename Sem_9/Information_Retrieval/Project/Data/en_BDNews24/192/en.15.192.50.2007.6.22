<TITLE> Amu for reforms to forestall Khilafat deal, April 30 fiasco </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League needs reforms to pre-empt a repeat of tying up with the communal Khilafat-e-Majlish and April 30 fiasco, presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Friday. "No one was consulted when the Awami League struck an alliance with a communal political entity," Amu said talking to reporters on the needs of reforms. "Similarly, the April 30 deadline was declared without the approval of the party's executive council. Reforms are necessary as we do not want such mishaps to recur," he said in his home. AL general secretary Abdul Jalil had declared in 2004 that the opposition would bring down the BNP-led government by April 30 of that year, which did not happen though. "Both reforms within the political parties and in the administration as well are necessary. The reform proposals can be finalised in a meeting of the executive council once the ban on indoor politics goes," he said. Amu said the government might lift the ban even today considering the deliberations of the political parties. On the restrictions imposed on Sudha Sadan entry and the assembly of AL workers at his place, Amu said, "The party chief also came here on a few occasions to hold working committee meetings and even cabinet meetings in the past. "Party workers are rushing to me as they are being stopped going to Sudha Sadan." Amu said he saw the turn of political events after Jan. 11 positively. After briefing reporters, he held meetings with the AL organising secretary Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Sultan Md Mansur Ahmed, and relief and social welfare secretary professor Nazma Rahman. bdnews24.
