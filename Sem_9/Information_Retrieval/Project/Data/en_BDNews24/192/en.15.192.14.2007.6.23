 PARIS, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France will unveil one of its most dazzling architectural showcases, the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, next week after a restoration that has brought fresh life to colors buried for years under grime. The Hall, which witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Versailles after World War One, has undergone a three-year, 12 million euros ($16.08 million) facelift that officials say will restore its splendor without artificial rejuvenation.

It was also where the victorious King of Prussia, Wilhelm I, proclaimed the inauguration of the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Versailles is included on the United Nations' list of world heritage sites but over the years, the luminous coloring of the paintings had become darkened and obscured. Some of the mirrors had become streaked and discolored. "Honestly, it was all dark. Le Brun's paintings had taken on a very dark academic air, whereas the painter was a great colorist," Didier said. The Hall of Mirrors has already undergone previous restorations, the first a mere 15 years after its completion to repair damage caused by condensation from the breath of hundreds of courtiers and the soot from thousands of candles. The latest restoration was carried out in stages and the gallery, which attracts 3 million visitors a year, remained open while the work was being carried ou
