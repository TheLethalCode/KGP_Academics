 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnesw24.com)  Some 1,600 employees of Biman Bangladesh Airlines have applied for 'golden handshakes' responding to a government proposal to lay off airline workers, a senior official said Wednesday. "Since June 5, authorities started receiving letters from employees. At least 1,600 letters have been received. And Wednesday was the last date of submission," said acting civil aviation secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali. The government proposal is in line with current plans to corporatise Biman and turn it into a profit-making organisation, he added speaking after an inter-ministry meeting. Civil aviation adviser MA Matin told reporters: "Currently the number of employees stands at 4,800. The number will be reduced to 3,400." The finance ministry has granted Tk 297 crore to execute the proposed golden handshake programme in which the employees voluntarily retire. To shortlist the applications, a committee will advise on the procedures of the programme, the adviser said. Airline ministry officials said the short-list would entertain 1,593 applications. The programme will be underway from July 1. On the question of what will happen to the rest of the employees, the adviser said the committee would see to it. bdnews24.com/eh
