 BEIRUT (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Time is running out for rival Lebanese factions to resolve their worst political dispute since Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said on Wednesday. The crisis has paralyzed normal government in Lebanon since November when ministers allied to Syria quit the cabinet of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, who has the backing of the United States, France and U.S.-allied Arab states.
