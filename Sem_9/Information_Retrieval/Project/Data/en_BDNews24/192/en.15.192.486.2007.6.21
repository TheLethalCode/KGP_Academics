<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Brothers Union Thursday surged to a 3-0 win over Arambagh Krira Sangsta on second-half strikes in the second-leg encounter of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The all oranges with the win raised their tally to 22 points from 13 games to remain in the fifth position. Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club are at the top of the 11-team table with 26 points from 14 matches. Muktijoddha Sangad are one behind them having played a game less. Dhaka Abahani Limited and Sheikh Russel KC share the third spot on 23 points but the sky-blues have played a match less than Sheikh Russel's 13. Visitors Arambagh, who conceded a 3-1 defeat to the same rivals at home, kept the hosts at bay in the first with their goalkeeper Mitul Hasan saving three sharp chances. Brothers midfielder Manwar Hossain broke their resistance in the 57th minute when he was set up by Faisal Mahmud. Manwar saw his innocent chip slip past the desperate hands of Mitul. Two minutes later, striker Mehdi Hasan Tapu scored the second when he chipped over an advancing Mitul from the left after running into a nice pass from defender Sahanur Rahman Ronny. Nigerian striker Elijah Obagbemiro Junior sealed the victory in the 73rd minute with an angular shot from inside the box giving substitute keeper Rezwan Hossain Shainik no chance. The match would have been different had Arambagh striker Nurul Islam not failed to put the ball in with no-one around seven minutes into the second half. Nurul again let the visitors down in the 64th minute when he had a free post with Brothers goalkeeper Mohammad Ali down on the edge of the box.
