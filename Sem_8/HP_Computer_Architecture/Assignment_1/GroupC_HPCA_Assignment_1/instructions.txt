GROUP C - Instructions

1) The program assigned for simulation to our group is "qsort4.c". It has been compiled and made it into a executable file "qsort".

2) To run the custom config script for the top 10 configurations, do the following :-
    - Download the submission
    - In the terminal, `cd` into the folder of the submission
    - Run the following command:- `export CODE=$(pwd)`
    - Then, goto the gem5 root directory in the terminal
    - Run the following command:- `build/X86/gem5.opt ${CODE}/customConfig.py --cmd=${CODE}/qsort --rank=1`
    - Change the value of the rank argument from 1 to 10 to run the simulation for all the top 10 configurations
    - The output is stored in m5out folder present in the gem5 root directory 

3) The 'm5out/stats.txt' for the top 10 configurations is stored in m5out/rank<num>_stats.txt, where <num> is replaced by 
the rank of the corresponding configuration

4) The report detailing the top 10 configurations, the analysis and the plots for various statistics is in "Report.pdf" file.
